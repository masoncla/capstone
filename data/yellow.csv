Full of tender noodles, chicken and veggies in a creamy sauce and cooked in one pan for easy clean-up, this recipe is a weeknight dream.One Pot Meals have become a staple in our home and we especially enjoy One Pot Cheesy Smoked Sausage Pasta and One Pot Chicken Alfredo. I love them for the ease of cooking and clean up and my kids love them because they taste really good! Cooking the pasta IN the sauce creates a delicious, rich flavor that you just can’t get when cooking in water.When I was a young girl I used to visit my aunt and grandmother often. My aunt used to make the best chicken and noodles! So rich and creamy and delicious that you couldn’t help but ask for seconds. I was wanting to recreate her recipe, but in a one pot version, so I got to work creating this dish.My cousins were talking about this the other day, chatting back and forth on facebook, remembering how much they loved this recipe from the grandma as kids.

Seriously, so many yummy flavors melting together to create a rich, savory meal that the whole family will love.

You could cut the cooking time by about 10 minutes if you do that. You could also swap out the sharp cheddar for something a little more mild like jack cheese or mozzarella. Adding some parmesan cheese would be fantastic! Or you could even leave out the cheese altogether.See? Four super easy and simple steps!Unfortunately pasta just doesn’t hold up well to freezing and simply turns to mush when reheated. The sauce will separate and become grainy.If you have leftovers, I recommend storing them in an airtight container in the fridge and enjoying within 3-4 days. To reheat, add a little bit of milk or cream and heat on the stove or in the microwave on 50% power.A lot of people ask what pan I use. I use my Simply Calphalon Nonstick 5-qt. Sauté Pan.

It is one of the few things she can eat, and she is in heaven every time I make it.When I am cooking this from its frozen state, I don’t add any liquid to the bottom of the crock pot because as the roast thaws it will release plenty of liquid. If the meat is fresh or thawed, I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water or chicken broth. Likewise, if you get a pork roast that has not had broth and salt added to it, you may want to add more salt.This pork pairs well with mashed potatoes, rice, and any kind of vegetable.

They are also picnic perfect, served with a side of Classic Macaroni Salad or tangy Walnut Coleslaw.While the traditional club sandwich has sliced chicken or turkey, these days it is usually a combination of two lunch meats.

I’ve seen a club with red onion slices on the menu, but personally, I like to add some avocado and leave off the tomato.

There are usually 3 different types of ground beef available and they range in fat content from 7 to 30 percent.Ground beef is usually good for 3-4 days in the fridge before it needs to be cooked or frozen.

8,"This savory, juicy Cajun Pork Tenderloin is the perfect main attraction for any dinner.  The cajun seasoning provides a ton of flavor without being too spicy, while a two-step roasting process guarantees a tender juicy bite every time.We love pork tenderloin for how easy it is to cook and how it can take on a variety of flavors from Lemon Garlic to Herb seasoned.I have cooking Pork Tenderloin using this method for about 15 years now. That’s not to say that I don’t love to throw it on the grill from time to time, but this searing and roasting method has my heart. It’s tender and juicy every single time and it’s perfect for feeding our family of five.Tenderloin does best with a high heat cooking in a short amount of time. This meal only takes about 30 minutes from prep to finish!This recipe calls for 2-2 1/2 pounds of pork tenderloin. Since each tenderloin will average around a pound, you will use two of them, but try to get two that are about the same size and weight. They are often sold in packs of two, but you’ll want to check with your local store.There are two steps in the cooking process for pork tenderloin.The main difference is the cut – they come from totally different parts of the animal. Both are very lean cuts of meat, but giving their variance in size and shape, one cannot be substituted for the other.The rule of thumb used to be that pork had to be eaten well done (165 degrees), which often resulted is a tough leathery piece of meat. The FDA now says that pork is safe to consume medium rare (145 degrees). This will give you a tender, juicy piece of pork that is slightly pink in the middle.Trim it. There is a thin, silvery strip of skin that runs along one side of the pork. This is a tendon and you’ll want to be sure to trim that before cooking because it is quite tough to cut through if left attached.Season it well. In this recipe we use cajun spices and brown sugar for a sweet and spicy pork tenderloin. You can also add flavor by adding fats, like butter or olive oil to a skillet and searing the meat before baking or roasting. Pork plays well with a variety of flavors, from sweet to savory to spicy.Roast at a high temperature. I prefer to cook lean meats for less time and at higher temperatures. This method gives a nice color to the meat and also keeps it from drying out.Don’t overcook it. Pork is a very lean meat and can become quite dry if overcooked, even a little bit. Since the FDA now approves pork to be cooked to a medium rare, I recommended erring on the rarer side.Let it rest. Tent the tenderloin with foil right in the skillet and give it time to let the juices flow back through the meat, making for a tender and juicy bite every time. If cut too soon, the juices will spill out onto the cutting board and that’s just flavor escaping.Slice into thick medallions. Using a sharp knife, slice pork tenderloin lengthwise into half inch rounds.Our stand-bys that go with just about any meal are a crisp green salad and some of the Best Ever Cheesy Garlic Bread.

With a five minute prep time and just 20 minutes in the oven, you’ll have this dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes.Did you know that “chicken breast recipes” are one of the most highly searched things on Google? I realized that while I have a lot of chicken recipes, I hardly have any that call for chicken breasts, and they are actually something I cook A LOT around here. For years I have been using a method that yields the most tender and juicy chicken, which is important because let’s face it, chicken breasts, especially baked, are usually bone dry.

Keep it in a sealed bag in the fridge for a few days, or pop it in the freezer if you’re not using it right away.The method lends itself quite nicely to experimenting with different flavors, like my DIY Cajun Seasoning. Baked Lemon Chicken is also a great alternative!I’ve got lots of tips to share when it comes to my favorite chicken breast recipes, so let’s dive in!      All chicken, no matter what part of the bird, should be cooked to 165 degrees F. Use a meat thermometer and stick the pointy end into the center of the thickest part of the meat, or for bone-in chicken, the thickest part near the bone. Once it registers at least 165 degrees you know it’s time to tent and rest.The beauty of this baked chicken recipe is that it is incredibly versatile. You could serve it with just about anything from pasta to salad and have a delicious meal.

In a large soup pot, bring 32 ounces of chicken stock and 4 cups of water to a boil. Add a couple teaspoons of salt and the chicken. You can cut the breasts in half if you want them to cook a little faster.

16,"Having a great grilled chicken marinade in your back pocket is essential for summer grilling. This delicious chicken marinade packs a flavor punch without being overpowering, and it’s great with any kind of chicken, especially these grilled chicken thighs!Food just tastes better when it’s been cooked outside. You can throw just about anything on the grill, from steak and potatoes to veggies and even bread.Grilling season is in full swing and I am always looking for something new to throw on the grill. However there are some things that are just meant for the grill and just scream summer, like the perfect Grilled Chicken Marinade.I have tried different flavor combinations for grilling chicken over the years, but this is the one that’s stuck. It’s uncomplicated and unpretentious, super simple to whip up and tastes absolutely amazing on grilled chicken thighs, chicken breast, drums…even pork!A good marinade can be what takes your chicken from ho-hum to OMG in a 30 minutes. So what is a good seasoning for grilled chicken? The key to a good chicken marinade is to have a combination of ingredients:Once the marinade is combined, place the chicken in the marinade for at least 1 hour. If you plan to marinate for longer than 2 hours, wait to add the acids (in our case, the lemon juice and balsamic vinegar) until the last 30 minutes or so.PRO TIP: Don not reuse leftover marinade. If you’d like to baste the chicken in the marinade as it cooks (not always necessary, but can add flavor and juiciness), be sure to reserve some of the marinating liquid BEFORE adding the meat. Any marinade that is leftover from the meat should be discarded.The answer to this question actually depends on the type of chicken, and the thickness. One thing to remember with any type of chicken is just like a good steak, you want to set the chicken on the grill, then leave it to cook and get those beautiful grill marks. Chicken breasts should register 165 degrees F on a meat thermometer, and chicken thighs and drumsticks should be at 180 degrees.PRO TIP: If your grill has a thermometer gauge, use it. You want your grill to be between 350-400 degrees F when closed (and you need to keep it closed when cooking!). Don’t just rely on the knobs for low-medium-high temps. My grill run pretty hot, so those settings are pretty much useless.Looking for a great grilling utensils set? Try this grilling set that includes tongs, a spatula and a basting brush!

You want to make sure to use an oil with a high smoking point - olive oil will not work for frying tortillas. You'll know the oil is ready when it begins to appear glossy or shimmery. You can also test it by sprinkling a few drops of water into the oil - if it sizzles, it's ready. If you're using a thermometer (aff), you want to oil between 350 and 375 degrees F.Gently and carefully slide the tortillas into the hot oil. Do not crowd them in the pan - the tortillas should not be touching. It's usually easier to fry one tortilla at a time, depending on the size of your skillet. Flip the tortilla once, and fry for a few minutes total. The tortilla will start to turn a golden color; just be sure to remove it from the pan before it starts to really brown. The amount of time will really depend on the temperature of the oil but they will continue to crisp up as they cool.Place the fried tortillas on a paper towel lined surface to drain and immediately sprinkle with a little bit kosher salt for flavor. Top each tostada with refried beans, lettuce, cheese and chicken. Serve immediately.Set up a garnishing station with things like avocado, sour cream, tomatoes, olives or cilantro so that each person can customize their own chicken tostada."

The smell will greet you at the door when you come home after a long day and that creamy gravy will send everything soaring over the top.Cooking a pot roast in your crockpot (aff) is probably one of the easiest slow cooker dinners there is!Tougher cuts of meat actually make the best pot roast. In lean cuts of meat the high amounts of collagen break down and turn into gelatin which then tenderizes the meat, creating that melt in your mouth succulence. The juices thicken and create a rich, delicious sauce to spoon over the meat.Chuck, Brisket and Round roasts make the best pot roasts. I also like using tri-tip.You don’t have to brown a roast before cooking it in the crock pot. However doing so will create a more rich and complex flavor profile in the meat by caramelizing the meat and toasting the seasonings.

23,"Learn how to bake chicken in the oven in three easy steps with my Easy, Crispy Oven Baked Chicken Drumsticks! Simple to whip up and so much healthier than frying, this will be your new go-to for dinner.Growing up fried chicken was always a staple for dinner. I remember how much my grandma loved her fried chicken and mashed potatoes. She’d make it for dinner at least once a month, and the family would come running. What’s not to love? Crispy, crunchy, juicy and flavorful fried chicken is pretty much the bomb diggity of chicken.Unfortunately, fried chicken isn’t exactly the healthiest, though not too bad in moderation. But if you’re like us and want to enjoy that crispy, juicy chicken more often, my Easy Crispy Oven Baked Chicken Drumsticks recipe is the way to go.Tons of people who love my Crispy Baked Chicken Wings have asked how the recipe would translate to larger pieces, like drumsticks. Well I’m here to tell you it works and it is delicious! I didn’t change the recipe much other than increasing the ingredients to account for the larger pieces of chicken. I also swapped out the paprika for chili powder because it’s what I had available.The coating is a simple mix of basic seasonings, flour and baking powder. You could easily swap out the seasonings I used for anything you like. If you have poultry seasoning on hand that would certainly taste (and small) amazing. I like to keep my recipes simple, not requiring a ton of steps, but for even juicier chicken you could soak the drumsticks for a couple of hours in buttermilk.While the coating will help the chicken retain some crispiness, I sprayed my drumsticks with a butter based cooking spray to help them get nice and golden and crispy and laid them on a baking rack over a cookie sheet. Spraying them instead of coating them in butter helps to keep the calories and fat down which is always a plus, especially when you’re talking about fried chicken!Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and bake the chicken drumsticks for about 40-45 minutes, turning them over after about 30 minutes. You’ll know they are done when the meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices are clear. A meat thermometer inserted near the bone should register 165 degrees.A chicken leg refers to the entire upper leg portion of the chicken, which is the drumstick and thigh. A drumstick is strictly the lower leg.We love to serve our crispy baked chicken drumsticks with classic comfort food recipes:For more easy and delicious baked chicken recipes, try this one:Eat More Chicken!

Place the chicken in the bag a few pieces at a time and shake to coat. Set chicken pieces skin side down on the baking rack that has been placed on top of the baking sheet (or on the foil lined baking sheet that’s been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray). Place larger pieces toward the outside; pieces can be close together but should not touch. Spray pieces generously and evenly with butter flavored non-stick cooking spray.Bake in the preheated 425 degree oven for 45-50 minutes, turning over after 30 minutes. Spray again with the cooking spray after turning. Juices should be clear and temperature should register 165 degrees. If you are not happy with the color you can turn on the broiler for a few minutes, just watch closely to ensure the chicken doesn't burn.Cool slightly before serving."
24,"Instant Pot Chicken Pasta is a delicious comfort food dinner for any night of the week! With only a five minute cook time and minimal ingredients, you will have dinner on the table fast!Instant Pot Chicken Pasta is definitely one of my new favorite dinners. I love pasta and I love easy so this dinner is right up my alley. If you don’t have an Instant Pot, I highly recommend one! It is definitely the most used appliance in my kitchen and I have actually retired most of my well loved slow cookers to my basement pantry! I find myself reaching for the Instant Pot weekly at dinner time for delicious recipes like Instant Pot Loaded Baked Potato Soup or Easy Instant Pot Mashed Potatoes.I have tried countless versions of Instant Pot Chicken Rigatoni that I had found on the Internet, but to be honest, none of them were that great. They all called for way too much liquid. I love a saucy pasta, but don’t want it dripping in water! After trying a few failed recipes, I decided I was just going to write my own and I can say that this recipe is the very best of any I have tried! It’s deliciously creamy and has tender pasta with chunks of chicken and lots of fresh veggies!What I love most about this dinner is that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand.Making pasta in the Instant Pot can be scary but it really shouldn’t be. The key is to barely cover the pasta with some liquid, so that you get al dente pasta but not a soupy mess. It will cook nicely in just about 5 minutes for half of a pound. For a full pound of pasta, increase the time to 6 minutes, but no longer.When cooking fresh vegetables in the Instant Pot, make sure to cut them in large pieces. Small pieces will cook too much, even with only a 5 minute cook time, and they will get lost in the sauce. Keep your peppers and onions in large chunks for best results. Hearty vegetables like mushrooms and peppers cook best. Vegetables with a high water content like zucchini and eggplant should be avoided.If you are looking for a quick dinner in the Instant Pot, then you will love this Chicken Pasta!Here are some more delicious chicken pasta recipes you’ll love:Looking for more Instant Pot Recipes?Instant Pot Bacon Wrapped Balsamic PorkInstant Pot Buffalo Chicken Enchiladas","Heat Instant Pot to Saute.

25,"There’s nothing quite like a delicious, juicy steak. I’ve got some great tips for how to cook a steak that I’ve learned over the years that will help you get the PERFECT steak dinner every time.A steak dinner is the way to my heart in a hurry, paired with a Perfect Baked Potato and a Lemon Kale Caesar Salad. But how do you get that steakhouse quality steak at home? I’m going to show you how!Many, many, many years ago, I spent a lot of my free time watching cooking shows before they were “in.” Sara Moulton was a favorite – she’s awesome! And there was this show with Tyler Florence called “How to Boil Water” where he would actually go to someone’s home and teach them how to cook! I thought it was the coolest thing and dreamed that one day he would be in my kitchen teaching me. That never quite happened, but he’s made it into my living room on numerous occasions.One of the best tips I ever remember learning from Tyler was how to check the doneness of a steak by measuring it against your fist. First, make a relaxed fist. The fleshy area of your hand between your thumb and forefinger is soft, which is how a rare steak feels. If you slightly clench your fist, it’s a little firmer like medium doneness. Clench your fist tightly and the area will feel like well-done. You know you want to try it out so make a fist and I’ll wait right here.Pretty cool right? So that was just one of the tips I’ve learned along the way for getting the perfect steak.Steak is usually one of those decadent meals you get at a restaurant rather than making it at home, but the truth is it couldn’t be easier to make! You just need three main ingredients – steak (I like New York Strip or Rib Eye), salt, and butter. I usually throw in a little pepper and some herbs or aromatics as well.That’s it! Simple, right? Use these 7 tricks and I guarantee you won’t need to visit a steakhouse again.Serve it up with some baked potatoes and a salad and you’ve got yourself the perfect steakhouse dinner right at home. But if you’re looking for something more than the typical baked potato and salad, these steakhouse side dishes should do the trick.The steaks with the best flavor are going to have a lot of marbling throughout, because as we all know “fat is flavor!” The second factor is going to be the cut. Here are 5 of our favorite cuts for a tender and flavorful steak are:Filet Minon – an obvious choice and often the most expensive that you can buy at a regular grocery store. It isn’t the most flavorful, but you can easily rectify that with some simple seasonings.Rib Eye – This cut of beef has a lot of gorgeous marbling throughout, making it one of the most flavorful. It isn’t as dense and doesn’t require as much cooking time, so keep that in mind.Tri Tip – This cut is most popular in regions of California is is often referred to as the Santa Maria cut. It has a generous marbling and a great flavor that is best on the grilled. If you have access to this hunk of meat, be sure to try our Grilled Tri Tip recipe.New York Strip – Considerably one of the most popular steaks on any steakhouse menu, the cut of meat is thick and delicious with a flavorful marbling throughout. It is ideal for grilling or for the sear and oven cook method shown here.Porterhouse – This epic steak is two favorites in one. It has a New York Strip on one side of its bone, and a filet mignon on the other. It’s perfect for cast iron searing but also great on the grill.Whether you prefer your steak rare or medium, it should never be cooked to well done as this will result in a tough, chewy piece of meat. Medium rare is the often recommended for it’s warm pink center and deliciously crusted outside.Want to know how to perfectly grill your steak?

Cook steaks for 4-5 minutes, without moving them. Check for a dark golden sear, then flip the steaks over and turn off the heat.Add the butter to the skillet, basting the meat with the butter and pan juices with a spoon for about a minute.Slide the skillet into the 275 degree oven.

Some of our favorites include these Asian Style Chicken Drumsticks, Crockpot Orange Chicken and Slow Cooker Chicken Tacos.         Hello! I am Kacey from The Cookie Writer here today to share with you a wonderful slow cooker recipe that will surely plant itself onto your regular dinner menu.I can spend hours in the kitchen with no worries, but this is not the same for many. Slow cooker recipes are becoming more common in our household not only to beat the heat, but because they are just so simple! Asian chicken drumsticks in the slow cooker sounds like a standard dinner, but you can transform it into so much more!We usually serve them over steamed of fried rice, but my husband has recently gotten into de-boning the chicken before storing, allowing us to take that chicken a step further. Wraps, pasta salads, pizza, you name it! More times than not we already have a dinner planned and I still throw these on because they can utilize us in the future.While keeping chicken on hand in your freezer is a great idea, I recommend thawing bone-in chicken before cooking. Using frozen, you run the risk of the chicken not cooking all the way through to the center and drying out on the outside.So now you know I am all about leftovers, but something else I am big on is being frugal and seeing how far a dollar can take us. Yes, boneless skinless chicken breasts are awesome and convenient, but they are also quite expensive. These Asian chicken drumsticks use a cheap cut of meat and transform into a flavorful dinner for the entire family. Plus, meat on the bone has more flavor AND reduces the chances of dry meat (but don’t let this fool you, you can still overcook any meat!).

This recipe pairs perfectly with our Easy Oven Baked Chicken Drumsticks and Oven Roasted Asparagus for a delicious Sunday supper.Hi everyone! Amanda here from Old House to New Home, sharing the ultimate baked macaroni and cheese recipe. I am going to be completely honest and tell you that I have tried every single macaroni and cheese recipe in the book but they were never perfect. I wanted a macaroni and cheese where the cheese stayed creamy and you could taste the cheddar. I find so many baked macaroni and cheese recipes to be incredibly bland.This recipe is anything but bland. The spices provide a lot of flavor, and my secret ingredient (dijon mustard) adds to the tanginess of the extra sharp cheddar. I borrowed an idea from a friend who adds a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup but I only use half of the can. To be honest, I don’t like the flavor of condensed soup in recipes, but the addition here ensures that your cheese sauce stays creamy the next day when reheated. I always thought that my mac and cheese always tasted so much better if fresh, but not anymore! I can enjoy the leftovers for days because this recipe stays just as creamy for days to come!The pretzel crust is a fun addition to this already perfect baked macaroni and cheese recipe. The pretzels add great texture and saltiness and just make this recipe stand out from the others.

The bake time is really just to brown the crust. This recipe is the perfect hybrid of creamy stovetop macaroni and cheese and crunchy-topped baked macaroni!I am so glad that my quest to find the perfect baked macaroni and cheese recipe is over! I will never make another version, except of course my super popular macaroni and cheese bites, which are always a hit at parties!

Don’t forget the Irish Soda Bread and the green desserts, like St. Patrick’s Day Cupcake Cake or Classic Pistachio Fluff Salad.St. Patrick’s Day is one of my favorite holidays to spend with friends. We start the morning at the local pub, come home in the afternoon, and then I make a big meal. It’s pretty much always Beef Stew or this Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe. Both are great for serving a crowd and just as good the next day. I especially like having leftovers to make Corned Beef Hash.Corned beef is technically Irish. It’s associated with St. Patrick’s Day here in the states and comes from the Irish-American culture. It was originally used as a substitute for bacon by immigrants in the late 19th century.“Corned” comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt – also called “corns” of salt. Corned beef is a salt-cured brisket. There are two cuts – the flat and the point. The point tends to have more fat, but either will work great for this recipe.This recipe is crazy easy, you just need to give it some time to let the brisket do its thing.A note about the cooking liquid. You can absolutely use water only and this recipe will still come out great. I like to boost things a bit though, so I pour in a bottle of beer. Usually an amber ale or a lager…whatever we have on hand at home. You could also use low-sodium beef broth in place of or in addition to the beer. If you using both, do 12 ounces each and then fill the pot with water. I really like the extra depth of flavor it creates.My favorite things about this corned beef and cabbage is that it’s practically a fool-proof recipe. The hardest part is chopping up the veggies and slicing the brisket when it’s done cooking. Otherwise, it’s a set and (almost) forget meal. All the flavors marry together for a crazy good meal.Try some of my other favorite St. Patrick’s Day recipes!Food nerd. Cocktail enthusiast. Carboholic. Bacon addict. Basset nuzzler. Boy mom.

Add beer and enough water to cover the corned beef completely. Sprinkle spice packet over top and add bay leaves.Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 2 hours. (I flipped my corned beef about halfway through.)Add potatoes and carrots to the pot, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.Add cabbage, cover pot, and simmer for another 15 minutes.Remove corned beef to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from pot and transfer to a serving platter or bowl. Discard bay leaves.Slice corned beef and plate with vegetables or on its own. Spoon a little of the cooking liquid over the top of the corned beef. Serve immediately."

Made with just a few ingredients and packed with flavor, this dinner is about to become your new favorite.This recipe can be a complete meal in itself because it’s got protein, veggies and carbs all built in! However, we do like to serve fried rice with Asian inspired dinners like Crockpot Orange Chicken or Honey Lemon Chicken and Green Beans Stir Fry.This recipe is a family favorite. I love it because it’s simple to make with ingredients I always have on hand and it’s incredibly easy to customize. My family loves it because it’s absolutely delicious!

I have been making this rice recipe since the first time I watched a Teppanyaki chef cook it in front of me at a local restaurant 20 years ago. Yes, I learned how to make Fried Rice from Benihana. Don’t judge, because it’s seriously the best thing ever.When I say simple, I mean, seriously as simple as it gets!Chilled rice is better than hot because it’s had time to dry out a bit. Hot rice equals a mushy mess if you try to fry it right away. If you don’t have any on hand go ahead and cook the rice in a rice cooker and spread it out on a rimmed baking sheet then pop it in the fridge. In about 30 minutes you’ll have perfect chilled rice that you can fry right up.Depends what you add to it! Fried Rice is basically a cooked rice that’s been fried in oil and the amount of oil that you use can determine how healthy or unhealthy the recipe is. Adding a protein like egg and lots of vegetables can increase the nutritional value.I think this rice is even better the next day! Make sure to refrigerate the rice as soon as possible after serving, and store it in an sealed, airtight container. To reheat fried rice, microwave on high until it’s piping hot, stirring a few times. You can also reheat in a skillet on the stove with a little bit of olive oil or butter.For more Asian inspired recipes, you’ll love these:Hi!

My grandma always loved it – she liked quite a few things breaded and fried, but especially chicken. It’s always been a favorite of mine too. She prepared it in the classic fashion which was a flour dip, then eggs, then breadcrumbs.That’s my preferred method too, but I like to add some extra flavor, like with this Crispy Garlic Parmesan Baked Chicken. Plus, it’s baked in the oven and not fried, eliminating all of that unhealthy grease.

I served them with some lemon wedges which really add brightness to this dish.We don’t often have leftovers of this recipe, but when it makes me super happy because I get to enjoy it for lunch the next day.

This velvety smooth cheesy spaghetti comes together in under 20 minutes, making it a perfect weeknight meal.This simple pasta dish is as delicious as a complete meal (hello comfort food!) as it is as a side dish for other favorites like Grilled Steaks or Baked Chicken Breasts.I’ve been wanting to make a variation of this recipe for months now, and I finally set out to create my version this week. I have seen pre-shredded packs of the 4-Cheese Italian blend before, in fact I used it in these Italian Chicken Quesadillas. But twice I searched my local grocery store for this blend and came up empty handed. Plus, cooking with pre-packaged cheese isn’t my favorite thing because I’ve found that more often than not it just doesn’t melt as well as freshly shredded cheese.So the other day I was craving this creamy four cheese spaghetti and decided I was going to pull it together with whatever was in my fridge. Which happened to be Romano, Parmesan, Mozzarella and cream cheese. Close enough for me!There are several different cheeses that pair well with spaghetti.

Chicken wings are my son’s favorite, but peeling the meat off of those little wings is incredibly time consuming.My family are not huge fans of white meat chicken. They’ll eat it, but it’s not usually their preference because, as my son so lovingly puts it, ” I like soft chicken!” meaning thighs that are naturally more tender than breasts because of their high fat content. I want them to eat a little healthier so I’ve learned a few tricks to keeping boneless, skinless chicken breasts more tender and moist.Chicken breasts should be baked at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. Baking chicken at 350 degrees for 30 minutes will leave you with dry meat, but baking at 450 for 15-20 minutes will yield juicy, tender chicken every time.Baked Buffalo Chicken is smothered in sauce and cheese, so the cooking temperature will be a little lower, at 400 degrees so the cheese won’t burn.Because the chicken in this recipe is coated with cheese, we’re going to cook it somewhere in the middle, at 400 degrees so we don’t risk burning the cheese. This will allow the cheese to melt and still give you a tender, juicy piece of meat.You’ll also some these other baked chicken recipes:Hi!

I recently rounded up our favorite sandwich recipes and I can’t wait to add these Reuben Sliders to the list.A Reuben Sandwich is traditionally made with Rye bread, savory corned beef, tangy sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and creamy thousand island or Russian dressing. It can be grilled in a pan with a little bit of butter, or served cold.I took our favorite Reuben sandwich and made it into mini slider form.

Ground turkey is leaner and lighter than beef, saving you on calories. It’s delicious and I actually prefer it to beef or sausage in spaghetti sauce and tacos.Stuffed Peppers always seems like such a complicated dish to make, but I promise you it is so easy. You just need a few ingredients and in under an hour you will have delicious and healthy Turkey Taco Stuffed Peppers!This recipe does make a lot of the taco meat, and you will have enough to fill at least 6 peppers, maybe more, depending on how full you fill them. If you have any taco meat leftover, you can follow the directions below to freeze it.Precooking the peppers is not a necessary step for this recipe, but it can save you some time by softening the peppers. To precook, slice the tops off of the peppers and clean them. Place them in a large pot, then fill with water, making sure the peppers are filled so they don’t float. Bring to a rolling boil for 2-3 minutes, then transfer the peppers to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Proceed with stuffing the peppers with the filling.This is really a personal preference. Green peppers tend to have a heavier flavor, while red, yellow and orange peppers are on the sweeter side. Any of them will be delicious, but I tend to lean towards the sweet reds and yellows.Absolutely! These stuffed peppers actually freeze quite beautifully for up to 6 months. Allow baked peppers to cool, then place in a ziploc freezer bag or airtight container. To eat, thaw overnight in the fridge, then bake at 350 degrees until heated through (10-15 minutes).These Turkey Taco Stuffed Peppers can be a meal in themselves, but we love to serve them with:Keep this recipe on hand a quick and easy dinner that’s fun to eat, too.

44,"These Salmon Patties (aka salmon cakes) are tender and flaky on the inside, golden and crispy on the outside. Made quick and easy with delicious canned salmon and fresh herbs, my salmon patty recipe will knock your socks off!If you had asked me a few years back if I like salmon patties you probably would have gotten a deer in the headlights kind of look. That just didn’t sound good to me, so it wasn’t something I’d ever tried. I finally worked up the courage (silly, I know) to try them, and I was immediately hooked and knew I needed to figure out how to make salmon patties at home.This recipe is pretty straightforward, and is similar to the way I make my homemade meatballs. Salmon Patties are crazy easy to make, and require little effort, making them perfect for busy weeknights. Mix ingredients, form patties with your hands, then fry them up on the stove. The whole process takes about 20 minutes from start to finish.Salmon patties don’t take long at all to cook – about 8 minutes! Melt some butter and oil in a skillet and fry the patties about 3-4 minutes per side or until they are nice and golden. Have a paper towel lined tray or plate ready to transfer them to, them serve them up with some fresh lemon wedges or tartar sauce.Fortunately, the canning process doesn’t take away the nutrients in fish, so you’ll get protein, heart healthy omega-3 fats and other nutrients from both fresh and canned sources of salmon. While there can be a slight difference in taste the ease of using canned fish in recipes like these salmon cakes or tuna pasta salad makes it a great option.I served them with homemade tartar sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed veggies, and I’ve since added them to our monthly dinner rotation.They are so tender and flaky on the inside, golden on the outside and the flavor is out of this world. Give this salmon patty recipe a try and I bet your family will love them too! Hi!

Stir to combine and then with your hands, form patties. Use an ice cream scoop (aff) for easy portioning. Flatten them into ½” patties. (Should make about 8-10 patties)Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-medium low heat. Add some of the patties to the hot skillet (don’t crowd the pan - you want at least an inch between patties). It it seems like the patties are browning too quickly, reduce the heat. Cook 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy on both sides. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Repeat until all patties are cooked through.Serve with homemade tartar sauce and lemon wedges on the side."
45,"Cheesy Tortellini in a creamy, rich Garlic Parmesan sauce. My Garlic Parmesan Tortellini is so indulgent and full of flavor, and the best part is it whips up in just about 20 minutes!I think if I had to choose, Italian would be my favorite food of all time, and Fettuccine Alfredo would definitely top the list. I finally mastered the art of Alfredo at home a number of years ago, and I started making it a lot. Probably a little too much. It’s probably been a couple of years since I’ve made it at home, and I finally decided it was time, but with a garlicky twist.To keep this Creamy Garlic Parmesan Tortellini a tad bit lighter, I combined equal parts nonfat milk and heavy cream, along with a lot of garlic and fresh Parmesan. The result was an ultra creamy and delicious meal that took less than 20 minutes to make.The sauce and tortellini are cooked separately to keep the pasta from getting too mushy.  Once the sauce is cooked, the fresh, hot tortellini are tossed with it, and some fresh cracked black pepper and chopped parsley to add another dimension of flavor.If your sauce isn’t thick enough for your taste, there are a few things you can do.For more delicious and easy pasta and tortellini dishes, be sure to try these:Hi!

These easy french dip sandwiches takes very little time to prepare and will have your family raving about them!I love serving sandwiches for dinner like my Crispy Dill Chicken Sandwich or Barbecue Chicken Biscuit Sandwiches. But when I want something truly simple and un-complicated, a Baked French Dip Sandwich is my go-to.My Baked French Dips are super easy to make. Now, you could really go crazy and cook the beef yourself and make the Au Jus to go with it and even bake your own bread. But why go to all that trouble when this method is really just as good?When I feel like I’m in the mood for these sandwiches I head to my local grocery store deli. I choose the most rare of the roast beef they have in the deli meat case and have them slice it for me, but not too thin. I prefer the rarer meat because I’m going to be baking the meat in the oven and I don’t want it to get too tough. While I’m there I also grab some rolls and some Provolone Cheese.I recently made these sandwiches for the umpteenth time and thought I’d test out an update to the recipe by adding a little garlic butter and they were so over the top amazing that my whole family was disappointed I didn’t make extras. I also amped up our basic beef broth dipping sauce (au jus) with some extra flavor.There you have it – easiest french dip sandwiches ever! Of course my favorite Easy Homemade French Fries are the perfect compliment to my all time favorite sandwich, but we also love these sandwiches with a side of Classic Macaroni Salad or Red, White and Blue Cheese Potato Salad.The best choice for a classic French Dip Sandwich is a tender cut like a chuck roast that tends to have a lot of fat marbled throughout. It’s slow cooked with lets the fat melt and gives the meat flavor.Since we are making quick and easy version of the classic French Dip, we are using deli meat. My deli usually has two options – Angus Roast Beef and London Broil, which tends to be the more rare of the two and my go-to choice.A good quality, melty kind of cheese is best for a French Dip, like Mozzarella or Provolone. Swiss cheese or Muenster or even American are also good choices.For more quick and easy meals in under 20 minutes, you might enjoy:Ten Minute Oven Baked TostadasOven Tacos and Garlic Lime RiceFrench Bread PizzaFind all main course dishes HERE and all recipes from the site HERE.

Place back under the broiler for a few minutes or until cheese is mostly melted and bread is nice and toasty.Place the tops back on the sandwiches and serve with a side of Au Jus for dipping. I use the term “Au Jus” loosely since I really just grab a can of Beef Consume or broth and heat it up. To update the au jus sauce this time though, I added some minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce to create more depth of flavor and it was so delicious!Preheat broiler and place the oven rack at the top level. Stir together melted butter and garlic powder.Slice the rolls in half lengthwise and brush each side with the garlic butter. Place bottom halves of the rolls on a baking sheet.

48,"Tender pasta and chicken smothered in a creamy, garlicky white sauce – This Creamy Garlic Penne Pasta with Chicken is a delicious and easy meal for any night of the week!This chicken penne pasta recipe is a thing of beauty. Tender pasta and chicken coated in a rich creamy, and incredibly flavorful sauce with so much garlic – the aroma alone will have you melting.I love making cream sauces. It’s one of my favorite things to cook. I learned how to make cream sauces the easy way as a kid watching my mom and grandma. They always made it look so effortless, but the result was so creamy and delicious I knew it must be difficult.A basic cream sauce, or Bechamel, consists of butter, flour, heavy cream and salt. Some add pepper or nutmeg for a slightly deeper flavor. Want to make macaroni and cheese from scratch – start with the bechamel and just add cheese. Simple as that.To make this Creamy Garlic Penne Pasta with Chicken, the Bechamel is made with lots of garlic, and a little bit of Parmesan cheese. You can also make Alfredo sauce this way, although it’s not the “traditional” way, but it is a less heavy option versus the rich butter and cream.It really is a simple process, which I’ve outlined in photos below. Easy peasy!Once you’ve tossed the pasta and the chicken with all that cheesy goodness it’s time to dig in.

49,"Even though grilling is season nearly over for most of the country, you can still get that delicious barbecue chicken that you love with this easy Baked BBQ Chicken recipe.      Just like my Baked Chicken Breast recipe, this one uses simple spices and a quick roasting method to get the most tender and juicy chicken. I do have a secret weapon to get that sticky barbecue finish – the broiler!Baked chicken is one of the most popular weeknight dinner go-tos for busy families, my own included! Customizing that chicken with different flavors can be a challenge because there are tons of options. My Barbecue Chicken however, is one of the easiest, most delicious chicken recipes out there.      Chicken breasts can be tricky to bake because they are very lean with little to no fat making it easy to dry them out. Bake the bbq chicken in a preheated oven at 450 degrees for about 15 minutes or until the juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Baking your chicken breasts at a high temperature for a shorter amount of time ensures that they retain their moisture.To bake boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, preheat the oven to 450 degrees and just bake for a little longer, around 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees in the thickest part of the chicken. Chicken thighs have a higher fat content so you don’t have to worry as much about them drying out. Bone-in chicken will take an additional 20-30 minutes.This recipe is a great meal starter, and goes so well with just about anything you want to serve.

51,"Split Pea Soup with Bacon is comfort food at it’s fine, with a crunchy, salty twist. A thick and creamy, split pea base is loaded with veggies, seasonings and lots of bacon for a delicious meal that is perfect with a side of grilled cheese.It’s soup season, my favorite time of the year! I love it when the weather turns colder and we can truly enjoy delicious homemade soups, like Chicken Minestrone Soup, Hamburger Soup, or Smoky Vegetable Beef Soup. My kids, when asked, will always answer “what’s your favorite food?” with “SOUP!” Well, more specifically they will answer “Mom’s soup” because it’s one of my favorite meals to cook and to eat. Soups are very customizable, and I love just throwing in things I have on hand and calling it a meal. This Split Pea Soup recipe is my new favorite.When I was a kid there was a local restaurant called Pea Soup Andersens. Until recently I thought my family just called it that because they are known for pea soup…turns out that IS what they are known for but it’s also the actual name of the restaurant! There was on the way home from Grandma’s house from us and we’d venture there a couple of times a year. They had the best pea soup around, and we’d eat bowl after bowl.Split peas are field peas that have been harvested, dried and split in half to be used for cooking. They come in sweet green or a mild yellow varieties.As with lentils, split peas do not need to be soaked overnight and they only take about an hour to cook. You do want to make sure to rinse and take a good look at the peas, sorting through them to pick out any stones that may have been mixed into the bag.When cooked, split peas become quite soft and have almost a pureed texture. Split peas also have great nutritional benefits as they are low in fat, packed with fiber and protein, and are a good source of several vitamins and minerals.There are not a bunch of wild and crazy ingredients in this soup, which helps it to rise to the top of the favorites list. I do like my split pea soup nice and thick, so if you prefer a thinner soup you’ll want to use more broth or thin with water. Here’s what you’ll need:Split pea soup is a delicious meal on it’s own, rich with flavor from the veggies and bacon. We do love to top our soup with croutons and serve it with some grilled cheese or cheesy garlic bread.Store in the refrigerator tightly covered for up to three days. Split Pea Soup will thicken as it stands, so you may need to add a bit of broth or water to thin it out. Store tightly covered in the freezer for up to three month for optimal freshness.Hi!

Cut bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook in the pot until crisp. Reserve half of the bacon for serving later with the soup and drain all but about 2-3 tablespoons of the grease. Add onions, carrots and celery to the pot and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are soft and onions translucent. Stir in garlic, bay leaves, thyme and split peas and stir for 1 minute. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, then pour in 8 cups of vegetable broth. Increase heat and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for ten minutes, skimming any foam that rises to the top, until no more foam appears. Simmer uncovered for 1-1 ½ hours, or until peas are soft. Add more broth as needed while the soup simmers. Turn off heat. Stir soup to mix well from the bottom up. *OPTIONAL STEP: Using an immersion blender directly in the pot, puree the soup until slightly chunky (almost smooth but with some texture). Alternatively, puree in batches in a food processor or blender. Reheat soup in the pot and continue with the next step. Ladle into bowls and serve warm, garnished with reserved crumbled bacon and/or homemade croutons."

But our all time favorite buffalo wings recipe is the classic Chicken Wings!Chicken Wings have been a guilty pleasure of mine for ages. It’s a favorite snack or even meal when I want to really indulge and get a little messy. Buffalo Wings like these are a must-have staple for game day parties especially – everybody love them! Well I happen to love them too but I’m a bit of a wimp with the buffalo sauce. The great thing about these Crispy Baked Chicken Wings is you can control the amount of heat but adding more of less hot sauce.We love heading out to Buffalo Wild Wings on hockey night to watch the game and enjoy a big basket of wings. While the kind of crispy chicken wings you get in restaurants are quite tasty, they are also typically deep fried – that’s how they get that crispy skin. Well now you can get that perfect crispy skin at home with my Crispy Baked Chicken Wings recipe!I’ve made chicken wings before, but I’ve never been able to perfect the crispiness until now. The key? Coat them with a little flour and baking powder! I also added some simple spices, but this little mixture coated over the wings made all the difference. They were delicious!!Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. A hot oven helps the chicken to cook faster and aids in the crispy skin result that you want. Bake chicken wings for about 30 minutes, or until they are nice and crispy and golden. Cooking them on a wire rack is optional, but can also help with the crispiness factor.Of course you’ll want to make sure you have carrot and celery sticks to help cleanse the palette, as well as some creamy Ranch or Blue Cheese Dressing for dipping.

56,"Tortellini Soup with Italian Sausage & Spinach is Tomato Soup taken up a whole bunch of notches with spicy Italian Sausage, Spinach and Tortellini. Finished off with a crispy, cheesy crostini, This is definitely not your run of the mill canned variety soup, and it’s a great one pot meal that’s perfect for a cold winter night!      This Tortellini Soup with Italian Sausage & Spinach is one of our most popular recipes and was originally posted in 2015. I have always been a fan of tomato soup. I love the creaminess, the rich tomato flavor and brightness of the tomatoes. So imagine my delight when I combined those flavors I love with spicy Italian Sausage, Spinach and Cheesy Tortellini!      A lot of people like to serve soup as part of a meal, typically the first course. But here we savor soup as our main course. I mean, it’s got everything you need – meat, veggies and this one even has yummy, cheesy pasta. It cooks quickly and in just a few steps. Of course, the longer you let it simmer, the better the flavor. Just be sure to plan to add the tortellini and spinach just before you’re ready to eat, so they don’t get overcooked.      I love to sprinkle a little fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top for even more flavor. I love this soup as is, but if you love a creamier soup, add a tablespoon sour cream to your bowl, or a half cup to the whole pot. (I tried Greek yogurt, but it separated and didn’t look very pretty).      Sometimes, when I’m feeling especially indulgent, I’ll make some stovetop Parmesan crostini. Just butter slices of bread and place them butter side down in a hot skillet. When the butter side is nice and golden, flip them over and top with a bit of grated Parmesan. While the bread crisps on the bottom, the heat from the pan will help melt the cheese. This is a little bit like a grown-up version of tomato soup with grilled cheese – super yummy and ultra comforting!      When they’re done just transfer the crostini to a plate. If the cheese isn’t quite melted enough for you, cover loosely with foil. Top your Tortellini Soup with Italian Sausage & Spinach with a crostini and let it soak up all that tomato goodness, similar to how the bread and cheese top a delicious french onion soup.If you loved this Tortellini Soup with Italian Sausage & Spinach, here’s another favorite tortellini soup recipe:Creamy Chicken Tortellini SoupAnd for more delicious soup recipes, try these:      Hi!

The pasta is tender and the meat flavorful, creamy and cheesy with a little bit of heat and a hint of lime. I used a jarred salsa for this taco pasta recipe, which adds a fantastic flavor, but you could also add some additional veggies, like peas and carrots, to round out this dish as a full meal. On the side, my taco salad (just leave out the meat) would be a delicious option.I love creating ground turkey recipes as an alternative to ground beef. It’s tasty and packed with protein, and is much lighter than beef which will save a few calories and fat while still creating a delicious meal.Making a big pan of my Ground Turkey Taco Stuffed Shells couldn’t be easier!

59,"The whole family will love my Slow Cooker Carnitas recipe! Tender pork carnitas that are so juicy and full of flavor, and crispy with no frying! Make some delicious carnitas tacos, stuff them into burritos and layer them in salads or on nachos!      Years ago, there was a little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant that was one of those places where you knew you could always get an true authentic Mexican meal. Some girlfriends and I would often go on the weekends because that was when they had these amazing melt in your mouth Pork Carnitas. They were served with the traditional rice and beans and tortillas, and we would always laugh because they were always garnished with a peach half, straight out of the can.But oh, their carnitas recipe was phenomenal. Well a few months ago that amazing family-run restaurant closed down. It was sad to see a small business closed, but it also meant no more Sunday carnitas tacos! I haven’t made them in my own kitchen for years since they never came close to my favorite meal, but I figured now’s as good a time as any to try again.This pork carnitas recipe is adapted from one I used to make that was good, but not amazing. It starts with pork shoulder on the bone (you can use boneless but I love the intense flavor the bone adds) and a lot of citrus and seasonings. They all go in the slow cooker and cook on low all day long. After 8-10 hours the meat is shredded, dunked in the juice and then broiled on a baking sheet to give you those crispy bits, a little trick I picked up from Pinch of Yum. And guess what, now they ARE amazing!I actually used to fry them in some oil in a hot skillet, but that just made them greasy. I love the broiling method so much more. However, if you prefer you can heat some oil in a large (preferably) cast iron skillet and fry the pork until crispy on the edges. Either way you get tender pork carnitas with lots of crispy bits.      Traditional Mexican restaurants will fry the meat to get is crispy, but to get those crispy bits of meat at home without frying you just need to broil the shredded pork on a sheet pan in your oven! Using a slotted spoon to drain excess liquid, place the shredded meat on a foil covered baking sheet with a raised edge. Slide the sheet pan under the broiler for 5-10 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and get delicious crispy bits. Serve from the sheet pan (do not put the meat back into the slow cooker).Slow Cooker Carnitas are delicious on their own served with traditional sides like Mexican Rice, Slow Cooker Beans or refried beans or wrapped in a tortilla with onions and cilantro, or even on nachos. The nachos are my personal favorite! You can stuff the meat into a tortilla and make tacos or burritos, tostadas or even enchiladas. This recipe makes a lot, so you’ll definitely have enough for two meals. Just be sure to serve some lime wedges on the side!Carnitas are the Mexican version of pulled pork and are traditionally made with a pork roast that has a higher fat content, like pork shoulder (also known as pork butt). Fat equals flavor! However if you are looking for a lower fat option, you can use a pork tenderloin. The meat will not be quite a tender but still tasty.      Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Rinse pork roast, pat dry and place in the slow cooker. Slice the garlic cloves in half and add to the slow cooker.Combine spices and rub all over all sides of the pork.Combine salsa, lemon juice, lime juice, orange juice and chicken stock. Pour around the pork.Set the slow cooker to low and cook meat for 8-10 hours.When meat is finished cooking, remove the roast to a cutting board. Discard the bone and shred the meat with two forks, removing large chunks of fat as you go. Skim the juices left in the slow cooker with a slotted spoon to remove any large chunks of fat or pieces of garlic. Place the shredded meat back in the slow cooker with the juices. (You could also shred the meat directly in the slow cooker if you prefer).*Optional Step: Preheat the broiler on your oven. Using a slotted spoon to drain excess liquid, place the shredded meat on a foil covered baking sheet with a raised edge. Slide the sheet pan under the broiler for 5-10 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and get delicious crispy bits.Serve hot with traditional sides, like rice and beans, or in tortillas with onion, cilantro and a lime wedge. Also great in salads and on top of nachos."
60,"My Spice Rubbed Grilled Tri Tip is the best ever recipe for Tri Tip on the grill. With 10 spices and seasonings in an overnight spice rub marinade, this tri-tip roast is tender, juicy and incredibly flavorful.         Tri-Tip has been my favorite meat to grill for so long it’s pretty much what you can expect from me if you attend a barbecue we’re hosting. I’ve been making it this way for years and have perfected the method over time. Today I’m not only sharing the recipe but I’ll be sharing some of the tips I’ve learned for how to cook this particular cut of meat.Tri-tip is not the most tender cut of meat you can buy. However, when treated right, it can yield juicy, flavorful, and yes, tender slices of meat right from your grill. The first key to getting tender, juicy tri-tip is the marinade. I am enamored by this spice rub and have been using it for as long as I can remember. There are 9 (yes NINE!) different spices and a little brown sugar for a touch of sweetness. You can see there’s quite a bit of fat marbled through the meat which helps keep it juicy.OK, here we go…1) Marinate. Tri-tip needs a good amount of time for the seasonings to penetrate the meat and help to break down that muscle. I’ve used a variety of different rubs and marinades but this spice rub is by far my favorite. The first step is to rub the meat all over with a generous amount of kosher salt. Salt is a natural tenderizer. Next rub the meat with the spice rub. Don’t be scared – it looks like a lot! But it’s going to coat the meat and give it a nice, flavorful crust when it’s grilled. Now toss it in a ziploc bag with some olive oil and let the baby rest in the fridge overnight. The longer you can let it marinate, the better – I’ve let it go as long as 36 hours and man was that a good roast!2) Throw it on the grill and LEAVE IT ALONE. Preheat your grill to a nice medium heat (I try to keep mine between 350 and 400). Let the meat sit out for about 30 minutes to bring it to room temperature, then set it on the hot grates of your grill. Close the lid, watch for flare-ups and leave it alone until it’s time to flip it over. Just like any piece of meat that you cook on the stovetop or grill, for the love, please let that meat be. It can take anywhere from 6-10 minutes per side depending on how rare you like it. Every time you lift it up or flip it over before it’s ready, you risk losing that nice sear and also overcooking your meat. Flip it once, let it sit and then flip it one last time.3) Let it rest. This tip is true for any piece of meat. If you’ve ever cut into a piece of steak right after it’s come off the grill you’ve seen those lovely juices (aka flavor) run all over the cutting board and onto the counter and there’s no way to get them back. While meat is cooking, the juices all run to the center. Those juices need time to redistribute throughout the meat which is what happens as the meat rests. Give it a good 10 minutes under a tented piece of foil before slicing it up.4) Cut against the grain. This is one you’ve probably heard, but when it comes to tri-tip did you know that the grain runs two different ways? One half of the roast runs one way, and the other half runs a different way. When you go to cut your roast, cut it in half first (pay attention to where the grain changes) then cut each half against the grain. You can see below when they kind of go their separate ways in the middle. Cutting it this way makes it easy to cut and chew the meat, and makes it even more tender.So that’s it! Those are my tips for getting the Best Ever Grilled Tri-Tip. This particular cut is somewhat regional and more readily available on the west coast. If that’s not where you are, ask your local butcher (or grocery store) to order some for you. It’s also know as a Bottom Sirloin Roast or Triangle Roast. I bet you’ll love it as much as we do!         and for when you don’t want to grill…Slow Cooker BBQ Baby Back RibsFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Trim the large chunks of fat (or have your butcher do this) from the tri-tip, and cut the thin silvery skin off if you can. Rub the salt all over the tri-tip.Combine the remaining seasonings (except the olive oil) in a small bowl and rub into the tri-tip. (*It will seem like a lot, but that's a good thing!).Pour 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large zip-top bag. Place the spice rubbed tri-tip in the bag with the olive oil and rub it in to coat completely. Squeeze out as much air as possible and seal. Place in the refrigerator for 5-6 hours, or up to 36 hours.When ready to grill, preheat the grill to about 350-400 degrees. Place the tri-tip directly over the flames on the hot grill. Close the lid and watch for flare-ups. Cook approximately 8-10 minutes per side for medium rare. It can take up to 20-25 minutes to cook a 2 pound tri-tip, so check the temperature (120 degrees for rare, 130 for medium rare and 140 for medium), or in a pinch use the flesh test (see notes). Place the cooked roast on a cutting board to rest, covered loosely with foil for about 10 minutes.Uncover and cut in half, where the grain changes direction, then cut each piece against the grain into 1/2 inch slices.Serve immediately."
61,"This Hamburger Soup Recipe is hearty and delicious, with a rich, flavorful broth. It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish, making it a perfect busy weeknight meal solution.*This recipe was originally posted in 2011.I’ve been making this soup exactly the same way for years. It’s so easy and my kids gobble it up, and always ask for seconds. It’s also a great meal for potlucks, soup suppers or for taking to a family in need because it’s super simple to double or even triple the batch and keep some leftovers for yourself.My kids ask for this soup over and over, which is why we make it so often. Ground beef is one of my favorite things to cook with because it has such great flavor already, so I always keep hamburger recipes like this soup on hand. But combined with the rich tomato and beef broth it’s just out-of-this-world comfort food at it’s best. I always add corn with my and serve a salad on the side, but you could add any vegetable you fancy – frozen or fresh. Anything goes with this amazing Hamburger Soup!I have learned a few tricks over the years to keep this tasty soup fresh tasting, even with leftovers. One thing I’ve learned over the years making this soup is that you have to be careful with the pasta. Ideally you want to cook the pasta separately (any small pasta that you have on hand will do) to help keep it from getting mushy. If I’m in a hurry though, and not planning for leftovers, I’ll just drop the pasta right in the pot and let it cook with the soup. I will also customize the soup with the veggies I have on hand, so this recipe is your baseline that you can make completely your own.If you are cooking the pasta in the soup, add the dry pasta with the veggies and cook just until the pasta is al dente. Refrigerate as soon as possible because the pasta will continue to soak up the broth as it sits, making it mushy and thickening the soup.For all soup recipes go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.It’s funny how some things change and some just stay exactly the same, isn’t it?

Add all of the ingredients except the cheese and sour cream to the crock pot. Cook on high for 4-5 hours if using raw chicken breasts, and about 2 hours if using pre-cooked.

In fact my daughter loves salmon so much she has eaten it every single night on every cruise we’ve taken. Unfortunately restaurants just can’t get away without overcooking the salmon it seems and it usually comes out a little on the dry side. Luckily, that won’t happen at home when you follow my easy steps for how to bake salmon perfectly every time!Salmon is an easy fish to cook. It’s delicate, but also holds up well to different cooking methods, from baking, to broiling, to frying to grilling. For this easy salmon recipe we are taking the baked route – it’s the most preferred in our household, and coincidentally, the easiest!You do have to be careful not to overcook the salmon. Overcooking results in a dry and stringy flesh that’s just not as pleasant to eat. I cook my salmon at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. There seem to be varying schools of thought on this, utilizing various cooking temperatures and times, but this method has always yielded a moist and tender salmon for me, that’s light pink in color and never overcooked.While this flavor combo happens to be one of my favorites, you can use other simple options such as fresh lemon with parsley or dill or just salt and pepper.There are generally two types of salmon available in my grocery store (and likely in yours, too) Wild Caught and Farm Raised. But what’s the difference?We prefer the milder, farm raised salmon, but both are delicious and will taste great when you’re baking salmon.

It’s a super easy way to speed up the recipe. However, if you prefer to cook the chicken within the recipe, just start with cubed, raw chicken breasts (about 2 that are medium in size or about a pound total). When you start to cook the onions, add the chicken to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Stir the chicken a few times, making sure to get it browned (or at least cooked) on all sides. The chicken does not need to be cooked all the way through because it will continue to cook with the pasta.Boil the chicken and pasta in the manwich and broth for 15-20 minutes and BAM! A complete chicken pasta meal in just 20 minutes!The beauty of One Pot Chicken Pasta recipes is that the sauce makes itself! The starch in the pasta is released during the cooking process, thickening whatever liquid you’ve include; in this case Manwich sauce and chicken broth.

70,"One Pot Mac and Cheese is a simple version of your classic childhood favorite. It’s creamy, delicious with three different cheeses, it’s a one pot meal that’s ready in under 30 minutes.Probably my favorite comfort food of all time is Macaroni and Cheese. I remember being six or seven years old and spending the night at my grandma’s house, and every time she would pull the Stoffer’s Mac and Cheese out of the freezer and that’s what we ate. To this day that taste still reminds me of her.Well now that I’m all grown up, my tastes have expanded, and I love to really dress up my mac and cheese.This recipe is great because you can easily adjust the amounts of milk/cream to make it healthier, or even use no cream at all (but why would you want to do that?). You can also experiment with different types of cheese. I made this one with Cheddar, Jack and Gouda (my new favorite!).Since we’re making this a one pot meal, you literally only need one pot. A 3 quart pot will suffice, however you could double the recipe in a 5 quart. Mix all of the ingredients (except the cheese) in the pot and bring them to a simmer. Keep it simmering and stirring for about 20 minutes at which point most of the liquid will be absorbed, then turn off the heat and stir in the cheese. The sauce will thicken as the cheeses are added, but you’ll want to let the one pot mac and cheese rest for a few minutes before devouring.I love using Cheddar, Jack and Gouda for my one pot mac, but there are a lot of other cheeses available. When selecting a cheese you want something that will melt easily and blend well into the sauce. Something with a sharp bite or nutty flavor works quite well. The 11 cheeses on this list will make you a seriously delicious bowl of mac and cheese.Absolutely! To keep your mac and cheese super creamy and delicious and not end up with a hot mess, add about a tablespoon of milk per cup of mac and cheese and heat in the microwave at 50%. This will usually take twice as long as what you’d expect a typical dish to take, but reheating too fast can cause the cheese sauce to separate which is not what we want. Microwaving at half the power will ensure that your mac and cheese heats up slowly and mixing in the milk with help make it nice and creamy again.If you love this One Pot Mac and Cheese you should check out my other one pot meals:Box grater – I love the large handle, and the different grate sizes.Cut resistant glove – I use one of these glove every single time I use my grater or mandolin.

It’s an easy weeknight dish that just screams fall – pumpkin recipes for the win!It’s velvety and smooth and rich and with less than a quarter of the cream and less butter than classic Alfredo sauce. So not only does it taste amazing, but you won’t even miss the cream or butter!I am a huge fan of Alfredo, but I usually avoid it since it’s definitely an indulgence. The classic sauce calls for 2 cups of cream and a whole stick of butter (yikes!). This Pumpkin Alfredo uses only two-thirds of a cup of half and half (half milk, half cream) and 6 tablespoons of butter. The addition of the pumpkin give a velvety smooth texture of the cream, without the fat and calories.

Then the half & half, pumpkin, Parmesan cheese and a pinch of nutmeg are added to the skillet and whisked together with the butter and garlic until the cheese is melted. I added about half of a cup of the pasta cooking water to thin out the sauce a bit since the pumpkin is a little on the thick side. You can add as much or as little of the pasta water as you like until the sauce is to your desire consistency. Finally, stir in the pasta until it’s well coated.

You’ll be the talk of your family’s holiday get-togethers with this easy to make Best Thanksgiving Turkey Recipe!Making this Thanksgiving turkey recipe for the first time? Be sure to read our FAQs at the end of this post! There’s something magical about the holidays; seeing friends and family, sharing some much needed quality time, and the food. Oh, the food! There is always a table lined with food beckoning everyone to eat, drink, and be merry! The quintessential Thanksgiving main course is a turkey here in the states and today I’m showing you how to cook a turkey that is flavorful and moist and that will have everyone raving!I remember the first Thanksgiving dinner I hosted…AKA my first time making a whole turkey. It was just a few short years ago and I was SO nervous – I didn’t know how to cook a turkey! What if the bird came out dry? What if it wasn’t cooked all the way through? Ahhhhh! I had a friend give me some words of encouragement and remind me that a turkey is basically a really big chicken, and I had roasted LOTS of chickens before. So I did some research and after finding tons of different ways to make the “perfect” turkey recipe, I decided to combine a few methods. The turkey was edible and I felt accomplished.Since learning how to cook a turkey, I’ve made whole turkeys almost every year at Thanksgiving. I’ve basted. I’ve brined. I’ve rubbed. If you’re thinking about brining your turkey, and don’t mind getting up at 2 am to start it, go for it! The turkey recipe I used that year was crazy good. However, lots of butter paired with a great dry rub and aromatics has become my favorite flavoring system. The real secret to this bird is the foil. Placing aluminum foil over the turkey breast helps dissipate some of the heat. Since dark meat takes longer to cook than the light meat, this method lets the thighs and legs get their roast on while the breast gently cooks. Once the foil comes off, everything cooks at the same pace and that gorgeous golden skin forms. This turkey recipe is juicy and super flavorful!Creamed Spinach with Bacon | Bacon-Corn Relish | Maple Glazed Sweet Potatoes with BaconHosting Thanksgiving this year?

From the bird's cavity, remove the neck and the bag containing the gizzards and heart. (You can keep these items to make stock or discard them.)Use a few paper towels to dry off the skin of the bird and inside the cavity.Lift the skin over the turkey breast (on the side closest to the legs) and slide your hand under the skin separating it from the breast meat. Do this on both sides of the breast.Insert three pats of butter under the skin on one side fo the turkey breast spreading them around evenly. Repeat on the other side.Sprinkle the dry rub all over the turkey - breast, legs, wings, anything you can see. Using your hands press the rub into the skin a little. If you have any extra rub sprinkle it inside the cavity.Place the onion halves and garlic cloves inside the turkey's cavity.Transfer the bird to your roasting pan. (I like to use a pan with a rack to keep the bottom of the turkey from getting soggy.)Take a good sized piece of foil and place it over the turkey breast. (You want to make sure to the foil piece is big enough to fit over the whole breast.) Press down and mold the foil to the breast., let the ends stick out if the foil's a bit big.Place the turkey in the oven and roast for 2 hours. Carefully remove the foil from the turkey. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees and cook the turkey for another hour, or until the internal temperature of the breast reaches 165 degrees F and the skin is golden and crispy.Remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest briefly before carving."
75,"This Stove Top Chicken Breast is so incredibly tender and juicy and takes only 25 minutes from start to finish. It’s one of the best chicken recipes there is when you want a fresh, home cooked meal on a busy weeknight!Chicken breasts are a staple in most households because they are quick and easy to cook and they can take on a variety of flavors. Our household is no different! The flavors of this chicken are similar to my Baked Chicken Breasts recipe, but you don’t have to turn on the oven, which frees it up for fresh baked bread, veggies, or even dessert!I use my favorite seasoning blend of spices that really give this stovetop chicken it’s incredible flavor. The best part is you probably already have them in your pantry, and it works for all kinds of chicken recipes!One of the keys to cooking boneless chicken breasts is to get them to a more even thickness. If you look at the breast you can see that it’s really thick at one end, and of course that takes longer to cook. The other end is very thin which cooks much faster. The problem with this is that you end up with one end that’s dry and the opposite end that could even be a little underdone, which is why a lot of chicken recipes get a bad rap. So to rectify that, pound that chicken! Use a mallet or even a small skillet to pound out the thicker end of the chicken and make it more uniform.This cooking process is simple but does require a little patience. After you put the chicken in a hot pan (listen to that sizzle!), whatever you do, don’t touch it! Let it sit for 4 minutes to get a nice sear, then flip it over. After about 2 minutes, turn the heat to low, add a pat of butter (totally optional, but adds additional flavor) and cover the skillet. This gives the chicken time to cook fully without burning.  Finally after about 10 minutes remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit, still covered (again, don’t touch it!) for another 10 minutes. This time allows the juices to redistribute (“rest”) so they don’t run all over the cutting board leaving you with a dry, lifeless chicken breast.There you have it – perfectly tender and juicy chicken breasts on the stovetop in just about 25 minutes!Here’s a little tip for you – See all that juice in the pan? Don’t throw it out! You can do one of two things:Either way you are making one of the best chicken recipes ever, even better!Hi!

Place the chicken in a baking dish and sprinkle the seasoning mixture over both sides of the chicken and rub it in with your hands.Heat olive oil in a large skillet (with a tight fitting lid) over medium-high heat. Add chicken and leave it alone to sear and cook for 4 minutes on the first side. Flip the chicken and add the butter to the skillet, swirling it around the pan as it melts. Cook for 2 minutes, then cover the skillet with a tight fitting lid. Turn heat down to low for 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and rest, covered, for another 5-10 minutes.Serve immediately with parsley garnish, if desired."
76,"An incredibly rich and creamy sauce made with roasted garlic, roasted red peppers and fresh grated Parmesan that makes for a tasty and elegant meal! This Roasted Garlic and Red Pepper Fettuccine Alfredo is sophisticated and so delicious!This Roasted Red Pepper Alfredo is one of our all-time favorite past dishes. Served alongside some of the Best Ever Cheesy Garlic Bread and a crisp green salad for a perfect for company meal!      I’ve always loved the roasted flavor of red peppers. I recently came across a couple of different recipes for Red Pepper Alfredo Sauce and thought it would be the perfect combination of the sweet pepper flavor with the saltiness of the Parmesan cheese. The only thing was they all used jarred roasted red peppers. Now, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a shortcut like that – I do it all the time. But for this, I really wanted to capture that fresh, oven roasted taste so I decided to roast them myself.Roasted Red Pepper & Garlic Fettuccine Alfredo is actually easier to make than it sounds. There are a few steps:See? I told you it was easy! Now let’s get cooking!The process for roasting red peppers is super easy, and is just quartering and gutting the peppers, roasting them under the broiler and finally steaming them in a plastic (or paper) bag before peeling. The skins will turn black, but this just means they’re ready to be steamed. See how black the skins get? They peel right off after they’ve steamed!            Since garlic is my all time favorite flavor, I decided to roast some garlic for the sauce too. The method is super easy but does take about an hour. There are 4 super simple steps.You could leave this roasting step out if you’re not a fan of garlic, or if you want a heavier garlic flavor, use a tablespoon of fresh minced instead. The roasting though brings out the sweetness which is so divine.Click here for how to roast garlic in the oven.Once the peppers and garlic are roasted and chopped into fine pieces, blend them together with some sauteed onion. I use my Ninja Blender, but you could also use a food processor. This will mostly puree the vegetables and will leave you with a slight texture that I love.Next add some chicken or vegetable broth, heavy cream and nonfat milk along with salt, pepper and fresh herbs like parsley or basil. Be sure to taste and adjust the seasonings at this point. I want to note that at the time I didn’t have an immersion blender, but if you have one, you could skip the blending step and just puree everything together with the liquid ingredients.For the final touch, remove from the heat and stir in some freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Toss in some cooked fettuccine and garnish with fresh Parmesan and chopped parsley.            Adapted from The Pioneer Woman.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Roast garlic according to instructions here. (*note - this step takes about an hour. If you prefer, just use about 6 cloves of garlic minced and saute with the onions in step 4). Set aside.Set oven to broil.

77,"This Easy Broccoli Cheese Soup Recipe is so simple, it’s on the table in less than 30 minutes! It’s a great dinner for busy weeknights or for a cold evening when you’re craving some rich and delicious comfort food.My son has recently developed an intense love for broccoli. I wish I could say he got that from me, but I’m not exactly the broccoli loving type. He’ll eat it sauteed with a little Parmesan or raw with some Ranch dressing for dipping. And he goes crazy for it in this soup!I over-bought on the broccoli a few weeks back and it was in the middle of “Storm-Watch 2017” here in Southern California that I had this sudden craving for Broccoli Cheese Soup. Could be that I had no desire to leave my house while it poured rain and hail for something like 5 days straight. Now before you tell me I should experience a Michigan winter before complaining about a few days of rain, keep in mind that California drivers get super flustered when they have to drive in said rainstorm. Not only that but there was so much rain that the streets flooded! The channels overflowed right near us and the streets flooded to the point that cars had to be towed out. Hence my desire to stay inside my nice warm house.Except that during said rainstorm and the coldest days we’d seen in quite some time (over a year, at least) our heater went out and the part that was needed to repair it would take a week to get here. So during the worst and coldest storm in the history of 2017 (ok probably a lot longer than that), we had no heat. It got down to 60 degrees in our house. Sixty degrees! I was waiting to see icicles dripping from my son’s nose! Seriously though, being cold and rainy (did I mention cold?) I knew a nice pot of soup would warm us up. So I put some Rosemary Rolls in the oven and got to work making this Easy Broccoli Cheese Soup.This Broccoli Cheese Soup literally took me 25 minutes from start to finish. The process is pretty straightforward and doesn’t require a ton of simmering and cooking time since there isn’t any meat.We loved this soup, but even more I love how easy it is to make. It’s rich and hearty and filling, and my kids have no clue how many servings of vegetables they’re actually getting!Absolutely! Make sure to store your soup in an air tight container or freezer bag (get as much air out as possible to prevent ice crystals from forming. You can store this soup in the freezer for 4-6 months. To reheat, defrost in the fridge and pour into a pot on the stove. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Microwave reheating is not recommended as it can cause the cheese to curdle.Tools used in this recipe: (affiliate links)Large Cast Iron Soup Pot/Dutch Oven: My favorite brand of cookware – this is the best I’ve ever used.

78,"This One Pan Garlic Parmesan pasta is a light enough recipe to serve as a main dish, or a delicious side dish to accompany your favorite meats. Tender linguine pasta tossed in a creamy, cheesy garlicky sauce make this one pot pasta total dinner-time perfection that’s ready in 20 minutes!From time to time I will update an older post, not because the recipe wasn’t good, but because three years ago my photos were pretty bad, and really didn’t do justice the dish! This is one of those, because this One Pan Garlic Parmesan Pasta is Ah-Mazing!This one pot pasta dish is lightened with the use of nonfat milk with or in place of whole milk or heavy cream. For the remake, I chose to use half nonfat milk and half heavy cream. The more cream you use, the more richer your pasta dish will be. I also chose linguine instead of fettuccine, but really any long, skinny pasta could be used. You’ll just need to adjust the cooking time slightly.First heat some olive oil in a 12 inch skillet. Add the garlic and stir as it cooks. It will become quite fragrant at this point and your family will come in wondering what that amazing smell is.As the garlic is just beginning to brown, you’ll add the rest of the ingredients, except the cheese and parsley. It will be getting all nice and bubbly at this point, so you’ll want to stir it up to coat the pasta and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the pasta for about 10 minutes or until tender. Once the pasta is cooked through (there should still be just a little liquid left in the pan), stir in the Parmesan cheese and parsley.Pro Tip – Add the Parmesan in a thin layer evenly across the top of the pasta and then gently toss to melt and coat the pasta. Do this in two batches if necessary to ensure the cheese doesn’t clump as it melts.      Hi!

81,"Garlic Tomato & Shrimp Pasta is an easy to whip up pasta dinner and a delicious weeknight meal that takes just minutes to prepare. It’s sure to be a new favorite!When I found out that my son is allergic to shellfish, I knew that my days of enjoying my favorite food – shrimp pasta – were over. It’s an indulgence for me to enjoy the sweet, succulent crustacean when dining without my son.It’s rare for me to actually cook it at home, but when I get an idea, like I did for this Garlic Tomato & Shrimp Pasta, I just have to try it. I am super cautious when it comes to cooking with foods that my son is allergic to, and it’s something I rarely do and only when he’s not home. I made this spaghetti for lunch one day, and it was downright amazing.Shrimp are incredibly easy to cook…but they are also incredibly easy to OVER-cook. You only need to keep them in the skillet for a couple of minutes on each side and they need very little salt. Depending on the size they take just 4 minutes or so to cook through completely, but you want to make sure that they are completed cooked all the way through. Raw shrimp is a no-no.Their sweetness really comes out in the cooking process and that’s why they pair so well with this sauce. It’s an easy sauce, and one that I absolutely love making because it has my secret ingredient – apple juice. now, typically a sauce like this would call for white wine but I don’t drink wine and I don’t even keep it in my house for cooking with. Just not a fan. However if you do have some on hand you could easily swap out the wine for the apple juice if you like.Well, the tomatoes can be so acidic that they really need some salt and some sweetness to cut that down. The apple juice adds that sugar and an added flavor that really marries well with the rest of the ingredients. I love using fresh cherry or grape tomatoes, but you could also use a couple cans of drained tomatoes. The tomatoes break down and together with the juices and the onions create this incredibly tasty sauce that just lightly coats the shrimp pasta for a delectable bite.Tender pasta, succulent shrimp, and a sweet, fresh tomato sauce make this Garlic Tomato & Shrimp Pasta dish classy and elegant enough for company, but easy enough to throw together on a busy weeknight.

Creamy and flavorful with lots of tender turkey and vegetables with a crispy stuffing topping. It’s our favorite leftover turkey recipe!Thanksgiving is on its way and we all know it is THE food holiday of the year. From potatoes to cranberry sauce to that amazing turkey, there are bound to be tons of leftovers. There are usually so many Tupperware containers filled with leftovers that it can be overwhelming! And of course you don’t want to let any of that food go to waste.Since we are a small family, we always have leftovers from Thanksgiving dinner. Seems we’ve never been able to scale down after years of cooking for 20+ at Thanksgiving. The day after, there are containers filled to the brim with leftover turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and rolls. And don’t even get me started on the desserts! Last year I had had enough, so I whipped up this Leftover turkey casserole and my family went nuts. Everyone needs a good leftover turkey recipe in their back pocket, and this is mine.The base of this recipe is of course all that yummy leftover turkey that is sure to be leftover from your holiday feast. Similar to a pot pie, a creamy sauce is made from scratch and coats the turkey and veggies – no canned soup needed – from scratch is so easy!The veggies can be a bag of frozen mixed or whatever vegetables you happen to have leftover. Green beans, corn, peas, celery, carrots and broccoli are all good options.To make the cream sauce you’ll first sauté some onions and garlic. To that you’ll add some flour and cook for a few minutes until it’s nice and golden. Finally pour in some chicken stock and milk and whisk it all together as it comes to a simmer. The sauce will thicken as it simmers.In a large bowl stir together the diced turkey and veggies. If you don’t have any leftover turkey for the casserole, chicken makes an easy substitute. Pour that golden, creamy sauce over the turkey and veggies and stir in some sour cream and just keep stirring until it’s all coated well. Pour that into a large, deep baking dish.Spoon the cold stuffing on top of the turkey mixture, or use your hands, and break it up as you go. You want to cover as much of the turkey mixture as possible, because some of it will sink a little as it cooks. Don’t have any leftover stuffing? Leftover mashed potatoes would make a fantastic substitute.Bake for around 30-35 minutes, or until the top is nice and crispy. Let it sit for just a bit to set and cool down – that sauce it hot! Then scoop your self out a big ‘ol portion because this stuff is delish!I like to garnish with parsley because it adds a fresh element and it just looks pretty but it’s not necessary. Dig in and enjoy!Large, deep baking dish – I love this one from Le Creuset because it’s perfect for casseroles, like this leftover turkey recipe, with it’s deep sides.3 quart sauce pan – This is my favorite brand of cookware – I’ve been using it for years and have never had any issues.

83,"Fresh zucchini stuffed with goat cheese, Parmesan and marinara, then baked to perfection. These Goat Cheese and Marinara Stuffed Zucchini Boats are a tender and delicious, low-carb and gluten-free option for dinner or served as a side dish.Zucchini is absolutely my all-time favorite vegetable. It’s super easy to customize and it’s such a mild flavor that it works in everything from dinner to dessert! It’s especially delicious when worked into an Italian dish like these Goat Cheese & Marinara Stuffed Zucchini Boats.Zucchini Boats are a fun way to use up all that fresh zucchini that’s available in the summers. You can stuff them with just about anything, but my favorite is just some cheese and tomato sauce.To make the boats, you need to first scrape out the seeds right down the center of the zucchini. The centers are nice and soft so you can easily do this with a metal spoon or even a small cookie scoop. Then just arrange them in the bottom of a baking dish. Now you’re ready to stuff them!I combined goat cheese (my fave!) with some Parmesan and a little cream cheese. The goat cheese can have a pretty strong, tangy flavor so the cream cheese helps to mellow it out a little. This will be the base and the topping for our zucchini boats. You’ll want to pat the zucchini dry as much as possible to help the goat cheese mixture adhere. Layer on the cheese mixture, then the marinara, and finally a few dollops of the cheese mixture again.I did put a layer of marinara on the bottom of the pan before adding the stuffed zucchini. Marinara is my choice for the sauce, but you could also use a regular spaghetti sauce, or even just plain tomato sauce if that’s what you have on hand.When the zucchini boats are baked, the dollops of cheese on top get that beautiful golden brown color. So pretty!I just love this recipe, so much that I ate one for lunch, and then served the rest for dinner. My family loved them, much to their surprise! I can tell I’ll be making these Goat Cheese & Marinara Stuffed Zucchini Boats over and over this zucchini season, and I can’t wait!Chef Knife: This is my favorite and the one that I use in my kitchen all day long.Baking Dish: Lots of recipes from casseroles to cakes call for a 9″x13″ baking dish, so this ceramic pan is a good staple to have in your kitchen.Marinara Sauce: This is by far my favorite marinara sauce to use for these types of recipes. It’s not too sweet, not too acidic; it’s so fresh tasting and there are several different varieties to try.Hi!

Take care not to tear the sides.In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, goat cheese, Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.Pour half of the marinara sauce into the bottom of an 11x7-inch baking dish. Spread about 2-3 tablespoons of  the goat cheese mixture into the bottom of each hollowed out zucchini and arrange side by side in the baking dish.

84,"This Homemade Tomato Soup recipe is bursting with robust roasted tomatoes and is quickly and easily made in your Instant Pot or pressure cooker.Tomato soup is a classic childhood favorite comfort food kind of recipe. I’m sure we all remember our parents or grandparents opening the can of Campbell’s tomato soup and serving it up with a nice grilled cheese sandwich, perfect for dunking.Well we’re grown-ups now so it’s time to ditch the can and make some delicious Roasted Tomato Soup from scratch!The key to getting some really amazing flavor infused into this tomato soup is by roasting the tomatoes first. Just slice them in half and place on on a roasting pan or a baking sheet with sides (so they don’t slide around). Brush them with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast them at a high temperature in the oven to bring out their natural sweetness and remove some of the moisture. Then straight into the instant pot they go.Saute the onions and garlic in the instant pot (aff) before adding the the broth. I recommend using vegetable broth, otherwise your tomato soup will have a chicken flavor that will overwhelm the tomato.Cook the soup according to the recipe instructions below. Then it’s time to break out my new favorite kitchen tool – the Immersion blender (aff). If you don’t have one, I highly recommend getting yourself one. It’s great for soups and sauces…and it’s just fun.Stir in a good amount of fresh chopped basil, and a splash of heavy cream if you wish. This would be the point to taste your soup and add salt or pepper. We like to serve our Homemade Tomato Soup with homemade croutons, but I would never turn down a classic grilled cheese or BLT served on the side.From scratch soups are a much better alternative to canned because you can adjust the sodium levels (canned soup tends to be quite high in sodium). Homemade Tomato Soup is an excellent source of vitamins A and C, and contains phytonutrients and other essential minerals.Besides the natural health benefits, soups in general are just feel good comfort food. Their warmth can provide comfort after a long stressful day, and can sooth a sore throat. Soups are definitely a favorite for dinner at out house.Adapted from Pressure Cooker Recipes.Hi!

85,"This Chicken Fried Steak Recipe is made with lightly breaded cube steak that’s fried to perfection. With a homemade gravy, this diner classic is a favorite for Sunday dinners and even breakfast!My husband and I decided to stop at a local diner for breakfast on one of our “date days” a while back. We threw caution to the wind and ordered big – that meant Chicken Fried Steak with Homemade Gravy. Served with two eggs, hash browns and toast, it was a pretty huge breakfast that we probably could have split, but oh man was it delicious! I said to him, “Why don’t we ever make this at home?!”My mom always made the best chicken fried steak, so I asked her to write up her recipe and to cook it as well. She was taught by her best childhood friend’s mom, so this recipe has been in our family for over 50 years. I know you will love it as much as we do.Chicken Fried Steak is a pretty straightforward recipe. If you’ve ever breaded and fried anything, you can make this. The homemade gravy can be a little tricky, but it can easily and quickly be saved if things go awry.Start with three dredging plates:Pat the cube steaks dry, the coat them completely with the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, then again with the flour. Then place the steaks on a large plate. To keep them for sticking to each other, place sheets of wax paper or even paper towels in between.Fry them in hot oil; they will take about 3-4 minutes per side. If they are getting too brown, your oil is probably too hot. You can always remove them and finish them off in the oven if they brown too quickly or begin to burn.Some of the oil is removed, leaving about 1/4 cup in the pan to make the gravy. Add flour and milk and whisk until thickened. Season with salt and pepper.My kids were a little confused by the word “steak” because the meat doesn’t really look like “steak.” Cube steak is a thin piece of round steak that been tenderized, then tenderized again. It almost looks like ground beef. You can see what it looks like HERE (via my Amazon affiliate link). You could also use ground beef, but it’s much better with cubed steak.Chicken Fried Steak is classic comfort food, so we serve it with comfort food sides, like mashed potatoes and roasted carrots and honey oat quick bread. Basically anything that you can spoon the gravy over is going to be a perfect side dish for this delicious meal.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Arrange four shallow dishes or pie pans as follows: Meat (season lightly with salt and pepper if desired), 2 cups flour stirred together with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, milk-egg mixture, beaten together, and finally a clean plate or tray for the coated meat.Start with the meat in the egg mixture, turn to coat both sides. Put it into the seasoned flour, turn over to cover evenly. Repeat coating with egg then flour. Place on wax paper (or parchment) and let dry for ½ hour.Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat pieces without crowding. Cook until edges are golden (2-3 minutes). Turn over and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Remove to an oven proof plate and keep warm. Repeat with additional pieces.Remove all but about ¼ cup oil from the pan. Reduce heat to medium-low. Sprinkle about 1/3 cup of your seasoned flour evenly into the pan and whisk until mixture is golden brown. If the mixture seems oily add additional flour a tablespoon at a time. Keep whisking and add 2 cups of milk. Let the gravy come to a slow boil. It will thicken gradually, about 5-10 minutes. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if desired.Serve with mashed potatoes and spoon the gravy over both."

They’re so easy to make! While most recipes do require a little time (AKA love) the flavors are worth every minute! This soup is no exception. I couldn’t stop eating it. I loved it so much I even made my friends try a spoonful of the leftovers when they stopped by…I’m a little crazy like that. They thought is was great! I love the validation.I love how easy and cozy this soup is. It doesn’t take a ton of effort and the flavor results are magical!I made this recipe using canned beans. If that’s not your thing, grab some dried great Northern beans and soak them in water overnight. Drain the beans and then add them to the soup per the recipe. I’m a convenience girl sometimes and the canned beans cut out some serious prep time.There’s also the matter of how much broth to use. I generally like my bean soups on the thick side, that being said I opted to use 3 cups of broth for this recipe. The soup came out runnier than I normally like, but everything was still delicious! If you like your soup thick too, add 2 cups of broth and proceed as directed. No matter how you like it, this Bacon Bean soup will satisfy even the biggest bacon freaks!      Food nerd.

88,"My Tuna Casserole Recipe is pure, classic comfort food. Delicious tuna, noodles and peas in a cheesy, creamy homemade sauce with a crunchy cracker crumb topping.Tuna casserole is one of those dishes that you just can’t help but love. It’s the ultimate comfort food from my childhood. I remember spending summers at my grandma’s and my aunt always making a delicious pan of tuna noodle casserole. It takes me back to those day and I have such fond memories.This Tuna Casserole Recipe is a version of hers, but instead of canned cream soup I make my own base – it tastes so much better and is better for you too.As with any flavorful recipe, this tuna casserole starts with sauteing some onions. This is probably my favorite step in any recipe because the smell is so amazing, my kids always come running asking what smells so good. Then are disappointed when I say “onions.” Ha!The crunchy cracker topping is optional – you can save a few calories by leaving it off – but I think it’s adds just the right finishing crunch. Bake your tuna casserole uncovered at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. The sauce should be nice and bubbly and the cracker topping a golden brown. If you want it to brown a little more you can always turn on the broiler and give it a few extra minutes there.Yes, you can! Let the casserole cool completely, then cover it in the baking pan with foil and place it in the freezer. Once it’s fully frozen, remove the tuna casserole from the pan and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap and/or foil. Place it in a zip top bag and back into the freezer it goes.It always cracks me up when people ask this question, because I am not a fan of peas either! You are free to customize with any veggies you like! Broccoli, carrots, etc. would taste great in this recipe. I would recommend at least par-cooking the broccoli, or fully cooking the carrots before adding them. You might even try sauteing carrots and celery with the onion at the beginning of the recipe. I think that would be an excellent addition!Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","In a large, deep, oven-safe skillet or saute pan (5-quart), melt butter, then add diced onion.

89,"My Grilled Steak Marinade will knock your socks off – it’s super simple and packed with flavor, giving you a tender, juicy piece of meat every time you’re grilling steak!Grilling steak is one of my all time favorite summer activities. That’s right, I said activity! I love to grill anything really, from meat to veggies to dessert, but steaks… a nice grilled steak is just summertime perfection to me and this steak marinade I’m about to share with you takes it over the top.A good marinade is comprised of a few specific elements:For this steak marinade let’s start with some fat. Add about 1/2 cup of olive oil to a small bowl, then add some lemon juice (acid), then whisk that together. Now it’s time for my favorite part – the FLAVOR! For steak you want a nice, rich flavor, which will come from a combination of soy sauce, Worcestershire and garlic. I like to balance that all out with a little honey with sweetness and caramelization.Steaks can be left in the marinade for up to 5 days, but you want to marinate them for at least 6 hours to allow all that rich goodness to penetrate the meat, tenderize and add flavor. I love how versatile this steak marinade is – it will work with pretty much any type of steak from strips to sirloins to filet mignon!When you’re ready to grill, remove the steaks from the fridge and let them come to room temperature. This will promote even cooking – throwing a cold steak on the grill will end up searing the steak before it’s really cooked. Remove the steaks from the marinade and discard it. Never reuse marinade that’s had meat in it.Steak grill time will vary depending on the thickness of the steak…mine were an inch and a half New York Strip Steaks and I grilled them about 7 minutes on the first side, 5 minutes on the other. If you’re unsure of how long to grill steak, follow this handy dandy chart. I’ve even made it into a printable version to take the guesswork out of grilling steak all summer long! These are all based on a medium-heat gas grill, at a temperature of about 350-400 degrees. Make sure you’re grill is fully heated before putting your steaks on.Now that you know the basic of grilling steak, you’re ready to make your steak marinade and get to grilling! This marinade is enough for up to 4 medium sized steaks.Hi!

Seal the bag, making sure to get out as much air as possible. (Alternatively you could place the meat in the marinade in an airtight container - just be sure to flip it a few times so the meat gets the marinade on both sides).Store in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 5 days. Or keep in the freezer for up to 12 months.Set meat on the counter for 20-30 minutes to come to room temperature before grilling."

Pinto beans or black beans? You be the judge! Don’t like corn? Leave it out! Plus you can create a toppings station and add even more ingredients to the bowl, just like on Taco night!What really makes this soup Chicken “TORTILLA” Soup is of course the tortillas! You can put some cut up corn tortillas right in the bottom of your bowl and they soften and mix with the soup, making it a little more thick, like a stew. Or you can use tortilla chips, and they won’t melt into the soup quite as much. And if you add the chips as a garnish, they add a lovely crunch to all the softer ingredients.There are some super easy and incredibly delicious ingredients that when combined together create the magical flavors in this soup.Well of course the basis of this recipe is CHICKEN! I use different methods for the chicken. I almost always make a couple extra pieces when I cook my Baked Chicken Breasts, and I always have some Slow Cooker Shredded Chicken on hand. If you don’t have any on hand, pick up a rotisserie chicken from your grocery store.Other ingredients you’ll need are:For garnishes we use things like sliced avocado, lime juice, cilantro, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes.I use my yummy homemade Taco Seasoning, but you can use a pre-mixed from the store (I like this one; aff). The main seasonings you want to include if you’re not using a taco seasoning blend are chili powder and cumin.Hi!

92,"These delicious Grilled Korean Short Ribs are so tender and full of flavor! Marinated in a tangy Kalbi style marinade for hours, this juicy short rib recipe is sure to become an instant favorite!When I was in high school, my mom was our church secretary. Or church rented space to a Korean congregation that would use the facility after our church services were over, and they always held a meal following their services, and that almost always meant Korean Short Ribs. Occasionally the high school groups would still be on campus, and we always could smell this mouth-watering aroma coming from the kitchen. Once in a while they would invite us to join them. Oh, that was heaven! They took pride in the food they prepared and there was a lot of it. Korean Barbecue, rice, vegetables were just a few of the items available. It was incredible.My mom secured their Korean short ribs marinade recipe long ago and has been making it ever since.The key to these Korean Short Ribs (aff) is the cut. English style cut shorts ribs are cut between the bone, so each piece has a thick bone with a good size chunk of meat attached. For Flanken style ribs, the ribs are cut lengthwise and across the bone, to create a thin piece of flank steak with several thin, oval shaped bones throughout. You may need to ask your butcher for this cut if it isn’t readily available in the meat section of your grocery store.The ribs are then marinating for several hours (the longer the better!) and grilled on your outdoor grill over medium heat for a few minutes per side. Because the meat is so thin, it’s important not to overcook these. Three minutes per side is usually perfect for a medium rare, but depending on the thickness of the meat and the heat of your grill, you may need to play around with this.The second most important trick to making amazing Grilled Korean Short Ribs is the marinade. It should be savory, with a slight tang and a full, rich flavor. the main ingredients in a Korean BBQ Marinade are:To get a tender piece of meat, you’ll need to marinate the ribs in this mixture for at least 3 hours, but the longer the better. We usually leave them in the fridge overnight. Then throw them on your outdoor grill heated to about 400 degrees (medium) for about 3 minutes per side. Just like with any meat, place it on the grill, then leave it alone until it’s ready to flip. Remove them from the grill and tent with a large piece of foil to allow them to rest, them serve while they’re still hot.We love these Korean Short Ribs with classic barbecue sides like Grilled Corn, Macaroni Salad and Grilled Zucchini.Here are a few more recipe to grill:Hi!

93,"These Monte Cristo Sliders are everything you love about the classic monte cristo sandwich, in “mini” form. Perfect for parties and gatherings, or just when you want something delicious and a little different from the norm.My dad had a sweet tooth. Actually, he had sweet teeth. Like, all of them craved sweets like nobody’s business. So it’s no wonder that one of his favorite sandwiches is the Monte Cristo.The traditional sandwich is basically ham and cheese sandwiched between two slices of french toast, covered in powdered sugar and dipped in jam. The sandwich is a variation on the French grilled cheese, also known as Croque Monsieur. It’s popularity grew in the 1930s and onward, becoming a staple at Disneyland’s New Orleans Square restaurants in the 1960s.It’s traditionally made with Swiss cheese, like I’ve done in the recipe below, but I think it would also be delicious with a white cheddar or Havarti, or anything that pairs well with sweeter fruits and flavors.To make the Monte Cristo Sandwich sliders, I used a loaf of King’s Hawaiian Rolls, slicing them in half across the middle to form two slabs. I spread them with dijon mustard then layered on turkey, ham and baby swiss. Finally I replaced the top slap and coated the rolls in a, egg and butter wash to represent the dipped french toast part of the traditional Monte Cristo.The sandwiches are baked mostly with a cover of foil, but the foil is removed during the last ten minutes to help get a crispy crust on the top of the rolls. The final touch is a generous sprinkling of powdered sugar and of course, a dish of strawberry jam for dipping.This sandwich is definitely an indulgence. If you’re looking for a calorie conscience sandwich, this isn’t it. It is however, one of the funnest sandwiches you’ll ever get your two little paws on.Recipe adapted from Jennifer Cooks.Hi!

It can quickly become dry and stringy which is NOT what you want, trust me. You want to almost undercook it so it stays moist and tender and delicious. As with any kind of meat preparation, using a meat thermometer (aff) is going to always be your best bet.To make my Honey Mustard Salmon, start with preparing the sauce. I use two mustards, Dijon and whole grain. I love the little pops of the whole grain, it’s just fun! There is also honey, smoked paprika and of course garlic. Spread this all on your salmon filet and pop it in the oven. Laying the salmon on foil and raising up the sides creates a little “salmon boat” and will prevent the juices from spilling all over your pan, making for easy clean up.The Honey Mustard Salmon bakes in a 400 degree oven for 18-20 minutes. Garnish with fresh minced parsley, because it just looks pretty, and serve it with rice and a salad.Want to know more about how to choose your fish and how to cook salmon? Check out my tips in this Baked Salmon with Garlic Butter recipe.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet pan with foil.Lay the salmon* skin side down on the foil and season lightly with salt and pepper. *(If desired, cut into portions first).In a small bowl, combine mustards, honey, minced garlic, lemon juice, smoked paprika, salt and black pepper. Spread this mixture evenly over the top of the fish.Bring up the sides of the foil around the salmon. This will help keep the juices from spilling all over the pan.Bake in the preheated 400 degree oven for 18-20 minutes. (Cooking time will depend on size and thickness; it's done when the salmon is a light pink color and is tender and flaky in the center; it should register 125-140 degrees F on a meat thermometer.)Remove from the oven and let rest for several minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh minced parsley and serve with lemon wedges."

Tender meatballs made with ground beef and ground pork smothered in a sour cream gravy and served over mashed potatoes or noodles – it doesn’t get more comforting than that!Raise your hand if you’re a huge fan of Ikea! Me, me, me!! But do you go for the incredible deals on cute Swedish merchandise or for the food…because I’d have to say the latter. Where else can you get a delicious plate full of meatballs and gravy for just a few bucks?At home. In your kitchen. Because now you have this tasty Ikea copycat Swedish Meatball Recipe in your corner.I grew up eating Swedish Meatballs that my grandma would make with this creamy, sour cream based gravy. The Ikea meatballs are different than what I remember my grandma making, but they are a bit of a cultural phenomenon here in the US, so I knew I had to find a way to recreate them in my own kitch. They are super easy to make…the gravy is probably the hardest part and it’s easy too. Pinky promise.I have a few meatball recipes on the site and I love to make them because they are super yummy and easy. For Swedish Meatballs, I use two different kinds of meat (pork and beef), and add some allspice. That’s what gives these meatballs a completely different flavor than traditional the Italian style. They have a warmth to them that is incredibly homey.Cook the meatballs over medium heat for about 4 or 5 minutes and transfer them to a paper towel lined plate to drain the grease. Then make the gravy using the remaining grease that’s left in the pan to make a roux with flour, then add beef broth, Worcestershire sauce and half and half. Stirring in the sour cream is the last step to make this creamy and rich Swedish Meatball Sauce.There are typically three different sides served with a traditional Swedish Meatball recipe:Ikea serves there’s with mashed potatoes, but at my house, we are #TeamNoodle. My husband has a thing for rice and gravy though, so I think that would be his pick. Good thing he doesn’t do the cooking. Just whatever side you choose, don’t forget the Lingonberry Jam!

Full of heart-healthy tuna, eggs, veggies and potatoes with a tangy red wine vinaigrette they are perfect for summer dinners on the back porch!If you’ve never had a classic Nicoise Salad, you are so missing out! Every salad love should try a version of this salad at least once. It’s got a ton of delicious flavors and is actually quite good for you.This classic French salad isn’t often seen on menus at your typical restaurants nowadays, but I remember trying it at a local French bistro many, many years ago. Unlike a traditional vegetable salad you might see today, the Nicoise includes things like green beans, olives, potatoes and hard boiled eggs. The main protein in a Nicoise salad is fish, usually anchovy or tuna, but sometimes salmon or other types of seafood.A traditional Nicoise Salad recipe includes both tangy and salty flavors. For my Nicoise Salad Lettuce Wraps, I chose tuna over anchovies (you’re welcome) and included green beans, tomatoes, baby potatoes and olives. The dressing is a simple red wine and olive oil blend with lots of garlic, capers and black pepper.I marinated the tuna for a while in the dressing, to keep it moist and tender, then layered everything in butter lettuce cups. The flavors are amazing together, they compliment each other so well. The potatoes might sound a little odd, but they add a wonderfully soft texture and smoothness.If you’ve only ever had a mayo based tuna salad, you’re in for a real treat. The red wine vinaigrette is a welcome change from mayo and mustard, and gives a nice tangy yet smooth flavor to the tuna in these Nicoise Salad Lettuce Wraps.I love lettuce wraps – they are such a fun way to eat a salad, but they can get messy so be sure to have plenty of napkins on hand!Hi!

Prepare to be the most popular person at the picnic!I’m from an Italian-American family, and I have to tell you, we know how to do a good get-together. More specifically, there is some serious eating happening and I’m not even a little bit sad about it (although my waistline might disagree!). Of course, there are always a wide array of pasta salads at summer gatherings. And at most gatherings, there’s also an antipasto platter full of veggies (marinated and fresh), olives, cheeses, and charcuterie.So I got to thinking: why not combine pasta salad and antipasto? These are two major players in the world of party platters and huge favorites of everyone we know. This is bound to be a hit!The great thing is, most of the usual suspects are also an excellent fit for a pasta salad recipe. And you know how pasta salads tend to get better as they sit in the fridge and absorb the dressing? Most of the ingredients here only get better as that happens (and the ones that don’t can simply be added just before serving). It’s basically begging you to make it ahead, which is totally convenient.Some of my other favorite pasta salads are:","In a large bowl, add pasta, olives, artichoke hearts, grape tomatoes, chopped onion, chopped fennel and half the bottle of dressing into the bowl.Toss well to combine. Refrigerate until you're ready to serve.Just before serving add soppressata, mozzarella, and basil.Toss to combine and taste.

Crunchy green beans, tender, flavorful chicken, and a sweet and tart honey lemon stir fry sauce that coats every bite.The best part is that this Honey Lemon Chicken and Green Beans Stir Fry can be ready in around 20 minutes, prep time and all. I did marinate my chicken in soy sauce and rice vinegar for about 30 minutes before cooking, but you could also just toss the chicken in that combo and and let it sit while you prep and start cooking. The chicken cooks in the marinade anyway. Either way it’s delicious!Start by cutting up the chicken and the green beans.

103,"My homemade spaghetti sauce is an easy recipe that will dominate pasta night! Make a double or even triple batch to freeze for the time time that craving hits.Spaghetti Sauce isn’t something that is difficult to make, but sometimes it’s just so much easier to buy a jar – not anymore!I have been making this homemade spaghetti sauce recipe for as long as I can remember. We have spaghetti and meatballs at least once a week, so I always make a huge batch to portion and freeze and save myself some time. This recipe is a simplified version of the spaghetti sauce my sister makes. She lets her sauce simmer for 3 hours, but mine can be ready in about 30 minutes.Like I mentioned, making a spaghetti sauce from scratch is pretty easy. You need some pantry ingredients, spices and herbs, onion and garlic. These ingredients are combined and simmered until you are ready to eat! My recipe calls for simmering the sauce for 30 minutes to an hour. However, the longer your spaghetti sauce simmers, the more intense and rich the flavor.A whole onion is sauteed in a little olive oil until nice and soft. If you are making a meat sauce, this would be the point to add your protein and fully cook it. Otherwise, add the basil (if using dried), oregano, bay leaves, garlic and red pepper flakes to the pan and toast them for about a minute, then add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste and stir it all around to combine.Once the tomatoes are combined and the sauce is starting to take shape, add the remaining ingredients – chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, sugar (to cut the acid in the tomatoes), salt and pepper. Tomatoes need a nice healthy dose of salt, but don’t go overboard on the first round. Let the sauce simmer for a bit, taste it, then add salt as needed. This works the same for the sugar. If you’re using fresh basil, this is the point to add it.Bring the sauce to a boil, then simmer for at least 30 minutes. You can totally toss some pasta with the spaghetti sauce at that point and call it good. But if you’ve got the time, keep it simmering for an hour or us to 4 hours to develop a richer, deeper flavor.When using canned tomatoes, I always choose San Marzano. They are a favorite for their sweet flavor and low acidity. This variety of plum tomatoes are grown in the rich volcanic soil at the base of Mount Vesuvius, The flesh is firm and not too juicy, they are deep red color with an easy to remove skin and low seed count. San Marzano canned tomatoes (aff) are considered a premium type, and there are several brands that carry them.There are several spices and herbs that you will find in different spaghetti sauce recipes. I like to keep it fairly simple with some dried oregano, basil and red pepper flakes for heat. I will sometimes add parsley, fennel or thyme. If you have access to them, fresh herbs are almost always recommended.PRO TIP: If you’re family is anything like mine, they refuse to eat spaghetti sauce with chunks of tomato. Do yourself a favor and pick up an Immersion Blender. (aff) It will puree your sauce in minutes – no more chunks left at the bottom of the spaghetti bowl!I like to serve this spaghetti sauce with pasta and Easy Homemade Meatballs and my famous Cheesy Garlic Bread.

We recently tried Garlic Parmesan Chicken Wings at our favorite restaurant and I was floored by how good they were…and that I’d never tried them before!I knew of course that I had to recreate them at home using my standard method for getting crispy baked chicken wings.Baking powder is typically used as a leavening agent in baking, but in this application it actually dries out the skin, leaving it nice and crispy. Don’t confuse this with baking soda, which is NOT going to work and will leave a nasty aftertaste.This is a super simple butter sauce that we are going to use to coat our crispy chicken wings. Our Garlic Parmesan Wing Sauce is made up of butter, olive oil, garlic, parsley, salt and Parmesan cheese.Melt the butter and olive oil, then stir in the minced garlic. Usually I’m totally fine with using jarred minced garlic, but in this case using fresh garlic is going to give you the best flavor. Let that cook in the melted butter to get all that rich flavor infused, then stir in salt and fresh minced parsley. Again, don’t skimp by using dried, use fresh!You can make the garlic parmesan sauce at any time, and just heat it up when you’re ready to serve the chicken wings.

(If using the baking rack, flipping is not required). *If using only drumettes, they may take a little longer to cooker since they are bigger than traditional wings.While the chicken is has about 8-10 minutes left, begin to make the sauce. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Once butter is melted add the minced garlic. Cook for about 3 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in salt and chopped parsley.Transfer the chicken to a large bowl. Pour the sauce over the chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle with grated parmesan and serve immediately."

They’re also an excellent way to use leftover chicken!Do you ever find inspiration in the most unexpected places? I know I do. One minute I’m hanging out, eating something tasty and minding my own business, and BAM! Inspiration strikes! The inspiration for this particular recipe actually came a bit later (and by a bit, I mean several years).When I was 19, I moved to NYC. It was a bold move, but the very best thing for me. Being that I’m from Western New York, getting home was as simple as hopping a quick one-hour flight, and I was often able to find excellent deals on airfare. On those fateful flights home, I had one standby snack that I always seemed to gravitate to at JFK (this was long before the days that Jetblue had a big, fancy terminal).They always had these Chicken Caesar salad wraps that were cut into pieces, resembling pinwheels. They were super light and full of tasty flavor, and although they were way expensive (hello airport food!) they were a tasty way to hold me over until I made it home to all that great home cooking!Whether you call them chicken roll-ups or pinwheels sandwiches, these make eating a wrap so much more fun! Here are some expert tips in making them:More of my favorite pinwheels:Other great light lunches are:","Lay the tortillas out on a clean, flat surface like a cutting board.Spread a thin layer of Caesar dressing onto each tortilla, to completely cover it.Scatter chicken and Romaine lettuce evenly over the tortilla.Carefully and tightly roll the tortilla up and away from you, leaving the seam side down.Cut the wraps into 1 inch thick slices.Carefully insert a toothpick into the seam of each slice to hold it together.Refrigerate until you're ready to eat. "
111,"These Shrimp Foil Packets are easy to make in the oven or on the grill. Coated in a lemon herb butter, they are perfect on their own or added to pastas, salads and more.I don’t cook shellfish often because my poor boy is allergic to it. My husband on the other hand could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day of the week. So on the days we we are home and the kids are in school, I will sometimes pull out my favorite recipes for us to enjoy, I almost always make these foil packet shrimp with some Fettuccine Alfredo!The first step is to decide on your shrimp. You can go the easy route (usually my top choice) and buy frozen that’s already peeled and deveined. Some packages will still have the tail on while some will remove them. I personally prefer to remove the tails completely so you don’t have to mess with removing them. You can also buy fresh from the butcher, but you’ll have to remove the shells and the little vein that runs up the back yourself.To make your shrimp foil packets, cut squares of foil that can be shaped into “envelopes.” Divide the shellfish into individual portions on each piece of foil. Top each pile with lemon herb butter (made with softened butter, fresh herbs, garlic and lemon zest) and a lemon slice. Spread the butter all over.To cook these shrimp foil packets in the oven, just arrange the packets on a baking sheet and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the shrimp are bright pink. To grill, heat the grill to medium heat and grill for about 8 minutes.Customize this recipe by swapping lemon for lime, or using any of your favorite herbs.In this recipe, the shrimp are steamed in the foil with the lemon herb butter, and they can be baked in the oven, or grilled on an outdoor grill, making them a perfect meal addition any time of the year. Once cooked, they can be served as is with various side dishes. We love them in my easy Fettuccine Alfredo or Penne Pasta Primavera. They also pair well with my Easy One Pan Cauliflower Mac & Cheese or Summer Spaghetti Salad.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","In a medium bowl, combine softened butter, chives, parsley, garlic and lemon zest. Slice the lemon into ¼” slices Set aside.Thoroughly clean shrimp and devein (pull out the small vein on the back). (For ease of eating, you can buy the shrimp with the tails already removed, or leave them on).Cut four large pieces of foil and stack. Add half of the shrimp to the center of one piece of foil, then top with half of the butter mixture and 2 lemon slices. Using two pieces of the foil, fold into a packet and close tightly so you have a nice, secure foil pouch.GRILL: Heat your grill to medium-high and place foil packets on the heated grill. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until shrimp is bright pink in color.OVEN: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place packets on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes. *For the oven baked method, you could easily get away with just using one layer of foil per packet.Open carefully and serve immediately. These foil pack shrimp are delicious with pasta or rice, and especially with our homemade fettuccine alfredo."

Add some onions and bell peppers if you like, and cook it all together for about an hour and a half on high or 3 hours on low. The chicken and veggies put out a lot of liquid, so you’ll need to drain that before adding the sauce. I recommend removing the meat and veggies from the crockpot and just pouring the juice out. You can also keep the juices for making soup another time!To make the sauce, combine spicy barbecue sauce, orange marmalade, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, garlic and cornstarch. Whisk the sauce together until it’s nice and smooth. For a spicier sauce, add a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.Pour the sauce into the slow cooker and return the chicken and veggies. Stir it all up so the chicken is completely coated in sauce, then cover and cook on low for about an hour. The sauce should thicken, but if you want it a bit thicker, spoon some of the sauce into a small dish and mix with some more cornstarch, then add it back to the crockpot. Stir and let it stand for ten minutes. You can repeat this until your sauce is a thickness you like.For more delicious Asian take-out inspired recipes, try these:Hi!

It’s super simple, tastes like you slaved over it, and is delicious with all kinds of pastas. We especially love it with Tortellini.About 11 years again when my husband and I first met, he casually mentioned that Fettuccine Alfredo was his favorite guilty pleasure. Well, guilty pleasure suggests that you rarely get to splurge, but he would splurge on the stuff any time we went out to eat. If they had Alfredo on the menu, you can bet it was going to end up at our table!My kids have become quite the Alfredo lovers, too. In fact on a recent trip to our favorite Italian restaurant the 4 of us all ordered it! You should have seen our servers face as he went around the table and we all answered, “Chicken Alfredo.”It’s such a simple meal, but is so homey and comforting. It’s no wonder it’s such a popular dish!There are basically two ways to make a homemade Alfredo Sauce. The traditional way involves a few simple ingredients and basically heating them on the stove and melting the cheese, and the non-traditional method involves creating a roux.I think both methods are delicious, and the roux method is definitely a “skinnier” recipe since it uses a lot less butter and a cream.

It caters to my Dominican hubby’s need for heat and my penchant for sugar. The main contributor to the flavor profile of this Bang Bang Shrimp is Thai sweet chili sauce (found at any grocery store or on Amazon), but after trying the whisked sauce, I felt like it needed something.The chili sauce is yummy on its own (perfect for dipping spring rolls in, for future ref), and combining it with the mayo gives it a creaminess that is completely unique to this recipe. I had plans on how to serve these shrimp and was looking for a more Thai-forward vibe.So I added a tiny bit of peanut butter – (peanut is) an often-used flavor in Thai cuisine.It’s safe to say this version should be called Bang Bang BANG Shrimp.The peanut butter is subtle, but the end result reminds me a little bit of Pad Thai, one of my favorite takeout meals.This shrimp isn’t only a perfect appetizer…you can easily turn it into a dinner protein!

But since I am a food blogger and like to get a little crazy, I’ve expanded on this simple, classic meatloaf recipe.First, I made my Stuffed Meatloaf, and now, I’m spicing things up with this Mexican Meatloaf. What makes this meatloaf “Mexican?” This homemade meatloaf has chorizo and salsa mixed in with the beef, and that’s all topped off with a sweet and spicy sauce spiced with cayenne.If you’ve never heard of chorizo (or used it) before, that’s okay! It’s a spicy Mexican sausage and you can find it in the butcher section of your local grocery store. This recipe uses just a little bit, but if you REALLY like things spicy, you can always use more!I use a mix of ground turkey, ground beef, and chorizo for this Mexican Meatloaf, but you can use all turkey or all beef if you like. (And if you forget to defrost your meat ahead of time, happens to me all the time, try my tip for how to quickly thaw ground beef.) The addition of the salsa and chorizo adds just a touch of heat that’s so tasty! But to really take this meatloaf over the top, you MUST add the topping!

124,"My Walnut Basil Pesto recipe is a rich and flavorful sauce that tastes incredible on pastas, pizzas or sandwiches. Thanks to California Walnuts for sponsoring this post.I’ve known my future husband off and on for about 11 years, and I just discovered that he loves pesto. I mean, eat it with a spoon and lick the bowl LOVES. IT. How can you know someone for so long and not know about something they love that much??Armed with this new found knowledge, a bag of California Walnuts and some fresh basil, I set out to create a homemade pesto recipe that rivaled any that he’d ever tasted. According to him, I succeeded because this is the best he’s ever eaten.Before we can get into how to make pesto, we have to know what actually is it?? Pesto is a flavorful sauce traditionally made with fresh basil, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic and pine nuts. My walnut basil version replaces the pine nuts with walnuts and I added fresh parsley and lemon juice. The lemon juice helps to brighten up the sauce which can sometimes feel a bit heavy.Despite using all of these fresh, healthy ingredients you may be wondering if pesto is actually good for you. I mean, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil are high in fat, right? Right! But what a lot of people don’t realize is this unsaturated fat is a good fat, that’s also found in avocados and salmon. Walnuts are also high in Omega 3s, so weaving them to your diet with recipes like this walnut pesto is a good thing!Here are some tips and ideas for perfecting your pesto game!My homemade Walnut Basil Pesto recipe has a variety of uses – spread it on sandwiches, as a sauce on pizzas, top chicken and coat pastas!

125,"Lemon Butter Chicken – Chicken breasts seasoned and seared to tender and juicy perfection, cooked with a tangy lemon butter sauce.For Valentine’s Day this year, I decided I was going to make something rich and delicious that was a little better for us that our typical steak dinner. Chicken breasts are a go-to for me when it comes to easy dinner recipes because, well, they’re easy to work with and they take on so many different delicious flavors. And let me tell you, this lemon butter sauce was absolute perfection with this chicken!To make my Easy Chicken in Lemon Butter Sauce recipe, you’ll need:Start by seasoning the chicken breasts and searing them in a hot skillet with a little butter and olive oil. You don’t need to cook them through just yet; they’ll finish cooking in the later. It takes about 2 minutes per side to get them to the golden brown stage. Transfer them to a plate while you make the sauce.To make the lemon butter sauce, add some more butter to the skillet. There will still be some brown bits from the chicken, but that’s fine – that’s flavor! To the butter add some minced garlic and stir and cook for about a minute or two before adding the lemon juice and zest, chicken broth, heavy cream and parsley. Bring that to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes. Add the chicken back to the skillet.Now at this point you have two options. You can slide the skillet into the oven for about ten minutes to finish it off, or you can place the lid on the skillet and let it simmer and finish cooking the chicken right on the stove top. I kind of base it on whatever else I’m cooking. If I’ve got potatoes in the oven, I’ll finish the chicken on the stove. If I’m cooking some potatoes on the stove, I’ll finish the chicken in the oven. Make sense? Either method will work just fine.Before serving, spoon a good bit of sauce on top of each piece of chicken, then plate individually, spooning more sauce onto each plate or take a sip for yourself. No judgement here – it’s pretty damn delicious!Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (if you plan to finish in the oven).Heat a large oven-proof saute pan or skillet over medium heat.

126,"Asian Salad with Peanut Dressing is crisp, refreshing and full of delicious flavors- this is the perfect healthy main dish but can also be made to feel a crowd as a side dish or starter that will have people fighting for seconds!Sometimes great recipes just happen. No planning. No inspiration. One moment you’re trying to figure out what you’re going to eat and BAM! You’re hit with inspiration. And that pretty much sums up the story of how this Asian Salad was created.A few weeks back, I had made an Asian-inspired meal prep one day and brought it over to my parents’ house to enjoy lunch with my mom. Unfortunately, I had also forgotten the dressing that went with it. So I went into her fridge and pantry and created a dressing right then and there that was so completely delicious that both of us could not stop eating our bowls.While we were eating our lunch that day, we both agreed that this dressing would taste even more fantastic over some sort of salad. It would be a healthy and delicious meal on it’s own or an excellent side dish-to-pass to enjoy with friends and family. So naturally I had to go home and recreate this salad, and boy, am I glad I did.Can’t get enough salads? These are some of my favorites!","Cut all vegetables and assemble into a large bowl.In a medium bowl, whisk together all dressing ingredients until well combined.When you're ready to serve, drizzle dressing over the salad and toss to combine.Serve immediately."
127,"My Easy Chicken Tacos will be the highlight of your Taco Tuesday! Tender, juicy chicken breasts are seasoned with a simple homemade taco seasoning and simmered to perfection, creating the best chicken taco you’ve ever had!I have a hard time ordering chicken tacos in a restaurant. Usually the meat is over cooked and shredded beyond recognition and simmered for hours in a sauce that creates a puddle on your plate. They might taste good, but the mess for me is almost unbearable. So I decided there must be a better way!To make my chicken tacos, start with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. If they’re frozen, thaw them out. Rub my homemade taco seasoning all over them and sear them in a hot skillet with a little butter and olive oil. Give them about 2-3 minutes per side so they get a nice golden sear. This won’t cook them all the way through but that’s ok, we’ve got a couple more steps.Once the chicken breasts are seared on both sides, turn off the heat and use a large metal spoon to scoop the juices from the pan all over the chicken. Do this for about a minute, then cover the pan and let it sit right there on the stove. The heat will continue to cook the chicken for about 8-10 minutes or until it’s no longer pink inside. This is when you can start prepping your taco toppings.Remove the chicken from the skillet and transfer it to a cutting board. Using two forks, shred the chicken into big chunks. To the skillet, you’re going to add some garlic, a little bit of chicken broth and tomato paste. whisk it together while bring it to a boil. Add the shredded chicken pieces to the skillet and stir to coat them in the sauce. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Finish cutting up all of your favorite taco toppings while the chicken is simmering in the sauce.But you can add any toppings that your family likes! Warm up some tortillas in the microwave for chicken soft tacos or bake some tacos shells in the oven. My favorite way to enjoy chicken tacos though, is in homemade taco shells that we’ve fried on the stove. Indulgent, sure, but so crunchy and delicious! If you’re going to make your own taco shells, be sure to use corn tortillas, and make them before your taco meat then keep them warm in the oven. This way your meat isn’t getting cold while you’re trying to fry up the shells.We also love this meat in my Chicken Taco Salad! Chicken Tacos go great with some Mexican Rice on the side.Hi!

129,"My Baked Honey Mustard Chicken Drumsticks are a hit every time! With a sweet and tangy glaze these baked chicken drumsticks are a family friendly favorite.My boy has always had a thing for bones. Ribs, chicken, doesn’t really matter. If there was a bone, he wanted it. Bone-in chicken is still one of his favorite things to eat, although nowadays he prefers to use a fork to get the chicken off the bone rather than gnawing it off like a barbarian.My girl has taken a liking to chicken drumsticks only recently, as she was always the dainty one who preferred her meat to be cut for her into nice, bite-sized pieces. My husband loves pretty much anything I cook, he’s awesome that way, and me – well, I am pretty much just in love with these Honey Mustard Chicken Drumsticks.Making a quick honey mustard sauce sounds pretty self explanatory right? Honey + Mustard = Honey Mustard. Well, for the most part it is. A good honey mustard dipping sauce is delicious with all kinds of chicken or pork, and typically it has mustard, honey, maybe some mayo or sour cream and a little vinegar for tang. This combo creates a luscious, creamy, honey mustard dipping sauce.But it depends on how you plan to use it. For my Baked Honey Mustard Chicken Drumsticks I like the sauce a little thicker and not so creamy so it will create more of a glaze, so I skip the mayo and vinegar, and add a couple of spices to the mix to add even more flavor to the chicken drumsticks.Baking chicken drumsticks is pretty simple. First, decide whether you want skin on, or skin off. Personally with this recipe, we are strictly skin off kind of people. But if you want to broil the chicken for a bit, you should be able to get it to crisp up quite nicely.Removing the skin is the most time consuming part of this whole recipe, and it may take all of 7 minutes. Don’t stress about getting every little bit, just get as much as you can.Next lay out the chicken in a large baking dish. This recipe makes about 10-12 drumsticks and depending on the dish you use they may or may not all fit. But you can easily just use two smaller dishes. Season the drumsticks with salt and pepper and brush on the honey mustard sauce. It will take about 40 minutes to cook them all the way through, then at the end flip on the broil to get that lovely caramelization on the top.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Remove skin from chicken and pat dry. *Note, you can also cook with the skin on and crisp it under the broiler. You can also use thighs or breasts but you may need to adjust the cooking time.Spray a 13x9-inch baking dish generously with nonstick cooking spray and arrange chicken in it; close together but not completely touching (you may need to use two pans, depending on the size of your drumsticks). Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper (to taste - about 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper)In a small bowl, combine mustards, honey, paprika and garlic powder until smooth and well mixed.Pour about ⅔ of the mixture over the chicken. Brush on to cover each piece with the sauce. Set aside the remaining sauce for basting.Slide the pan into the oven uncovered, and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and, using a large spoon, baste the chicken with the sauce from the pan. Brush the remaining sauce from the bowl over the chicken. Roast for an additional 15 minutes and baste again.Turn on the broiler and broil chicken for several minutes to help caramelize the sauce; about 4-5 minutes, watching closely to avoid burning. If using skin-on chicken this will also help to crisp the skin.Remove from the oven and baste again with the juices from the pan. Tent with foil and let stand 10 minutes before serving."
130,"Tomato Basil Pasta is a quick and easy recipe made with tender penne pasta and juicy grape tomatoes. Perfect for lunch or dinner and ready in just 20 minutes, it’s a delicious meal that the whole family will love.Penne pasta is my favorite pasta to cook with. It’s hearty, it’s rustic and there is no twirling required. It hold it’s own against some pretty delicious sauces, like this creamy garlic sauce, and it’s amazing in this Tomato Basil Pasta recipe. It’s also easy to pick up out of the pot with your fingers if that’s how you like to do things. No judgement here.The best, and my personal favorite, penne pasta recipe is this Tomato Basil Penne Pasta. There is no cream or butter, so you can feel good about eating the whole pan. I mean, about eating your portion. It’s super fresh, with a whole pint of sweet tomatoes and loads of fresh basil and garlic. Let’s get cooking, shall we?This pasta recipe starts as most good pasta recipes do – cooking the pasta just right! Bring some water to a boil, then salt it generously. I usually toss in a few good pinches. Measure out about 3 cups of the dry pasta. This doesn’t have to be an exact science, so a little more or a little less won’t hurt. You don’t want the pasta to be cooked all the way, so set your timer for a couple of minutes less than the package calls for. It will finish cooking in the sauce you’re about the make.Once the pasta is boiling, start on the sauce. Heat some olive oil and saute diced onions and garlic and a little red pepper flakes for heat. Next add the grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half and a handful of chopped basil. The tomatoes will release juices to help create the sauce. After a minute or two the tomatoes will start to blister; at this point you’ll add a ladle-ful of the pasta water straight outta the pot (that’s about 3/4-1 cup of pasta water).  The starch that’s released from the pasta as it cooks will help to thicken the tomato basil sauce.Boil the sauce for a minute or two, then add the pasta. If you time it just right, the pasta will be about 3/4 of the way done at this point, but if the pasta is ready sooner, just drain it and set it aside until you’re ready to add it; shouldn’t be more that a couple of minutes.Once the pasta is added you’ll just continue to let the tomato basil pasta simmer over medium-low heat. The pasta will finish cooking and become nice and tender, with a delicious tomato basil flavor. The tomatoes combined with the garlic, onion and the pasta water will have created a yummy sauce that’s smooth and luxurious and thick enough to coat the penne pasta. The finishing touch is a bit of Parmesan cheese that you can stir in, or just garnish the top with. Make sure to test the seasonings and add more salt and pepper if you like.Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the penne pasta and cook, until about three-quarters of the way done (2 minutes under what's called for on the package. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until soft; about 3 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes and garlic and cook for 1 minutes before adding the tomatoes and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until the tomatoes just begin to blister, about 2 minutes. Add a ladle full of the pasta water (about ¾-1 cup) and the chopped basil to the tomatoes.Add the pasta to the saute pan and bring to a boil. The liquid will reduce as the pasta finishes to form a sauce; 3-4 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup fresh grated Parmesan.Season with salt and garnish with fresh grated Parmesan cheese."

They are incredibly easy to make with very little prep, making these crispy baked chicken thighs perfect for busy night.My son has a real “thing” about chicken.

Full of tender slow cooked and incredibly flavorful pork, beans, tomatoes and seasonings, it’s hearty and perfect for game day, too!Don’t you love when those happy accident types of recipes work out even better than you expected? I’ll be honest, I never would have thought to use shredded pork in a chili recipe. I had been craving beef chili and took out a package from the freezer that I *thought* was a beef roast…turns out I was wrong! But like I said, happy accident. I used the pork roast anyway and it was delicious!Pulled Pork Chili isn’t much different from other chili recipes. You’ve got your meat, tomatoes and beans, onions and seasonings. Put it all in the slow cooker and let it simmer away for about 8 hours on low. You can bump that up to high and have your chili ready in about 6 hours if needed.You can even cook it on the stove in about an hour! Keep in mind stovetop pork chili won’t get quite as tender as the slow cooker version, but it will be just as delicious. To make the stove top version, cut the pork into small, bite-sized chunks, then boil in chicken broth for about 30-40 minutes. You could also boil in water, but I like the flavor the chicken broth adds. Then drain and add remaining ingredients to the pot and simmer for another 20-30 minutes.With your slow cooker, you do not have to sear the meat. However, there are some benefits.For this pulled pork chili, I recommend a light sear if you have the time.

Season with salt and pepper.(Optional step) Heat a skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear each side of the meat for 1-2 minutes per side, or until browned. *Tip - the searing helps caramelize the meat and lock in the flavor, but if you are pressed for time you can skip this step. For a thicker chili, dredge the meat in a little bit of flour first.To the slow cooker, add onions, meat, crushed tomatoes, chili beans (undrained), green chiles, chili powder, garlic and salt. Stir and cover. Set to high heat for 5-6 hours or low heat for 7-8 hours.Shred pork in the slow cooker with two forks (or remove to a cutting board, shred, then return to the slow cooker).

A perfect game day appetizer or delicious as a meal served with a side of rice and veggies.Ok, let’s be real here for a minute. Grape Jelly + Meatballs? Sounds a little out there, I know. But let me tell you, the grape jelly mixes with the spicy barbecue for a sweet and spicy sauce that lovingly coats the meatballs for snacking perfection.Meatballs are one of my all-time favorite game-day snacks. I say that like I actually participate in game day…I don’t. But I participate in food and if game day means food then I’m totally there. Therefore, game day is my thing. And meatballs are totally a manly, game day kind of food.This recipe couldn’t be simpler. There are literally just 4 ingredients, or 3 depending on how spicy you like it. Grape Jelly, Spicy Barbecue Sauce (affiliate link), Red pepper flakes, and meatballs. You could definitely make your own meatballs if that’s your thing. Saving time is my thing so I just use the frozen.

I like to make them on the stove top because it’s so easy and I can use my slow cooker to make some amazing Asian Style Chicken Drumsticks or BBQ Ribs.So to make these Spicy Barbecue Grape Jelly Meatballs, combine the barbecue sauce and grape jelly in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. You can toss in some red pepper flakes for even more heat, but that’s totally optional. Whisk the jelly and bbq sauce together until the jelly is melted and the sauce is starting to simmer. You can then add the thawed meatballs and toss them around in the sauce to coat completely. Cover it and let it simmer for several minutes until the meatballs are heated through. Now, my sauce wasn’t thick enough for my liking, so I added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. Again, this is totally optional, but it did transform the sauce into more of a glaze, which is what I was really going for.To make a cornstarch slurry, which is used as a thickener for sauces and soups, whisk together equal parts cornstarch and liquid. In this case I used about a tablespoon of cornstarch and a tablespoon of water. If you don’t want to add water to whatever you’re thickening, you can add some of the liquid from the recipe. Slowly pour the slurry into the pan and stir. The sauce will react with the cornstarch and begin to thicken almost immediately. Let it simmer for a few minutes, then add more cornstarch if you desire a thicker sauce.These Spicy Barbecue Grape Jelly Meatballs are a perfect sweet and spicy appetizer for game day or any party. My family enjoys them as a meal too, served with a side of rice and veggies, and my daughter has even been known to be the hit of the playground after requesting them in her thermos for her school lunch.As crazy as they sound, I’ll bet they’ll be the hit of you family’s table too!For more easy meatball recipes, try these:Hi!

It’s fairly simple, with a mayonnaise base, a little mustard, lemon juice, dill, garlic, salt and pepper.

Thanks to California Walnuts for sponsoring this conversation.Chicken is my go-to like many busy families, and I’m always looking for ways to change it up. This Walnut crusted version certainly does just that!My kids, like so many kids these days, are totally into chicken nuggets. While take-out and drive-thru chicken is probably one of the worst things for you, homemade chicken nuggets are a great alternative. You can fry them to get that drive-thru feel, try them in the air fryer,  or make homemade baked chicken nuggets, which is my favorite method. My kids love anything bite-sized or that doesn’t require a fork because that seems to just get in the way. (affiliate link)There are lots of things you can use to coat your chicken nuggets to give them that nice, crispy texture. Some suggestions would be:Walnuts are my favorite nut to enjoy just by the handful, so I knew that coating my homemade chicken nuggets with crushed walnuts was going to be a winner.

I like dipping them in a little honey mustard sauce, but they are amazing on their own as well. Kids and adults love them, making them perfect for an easy weeknight meal or a unique party food for game day.Like regular fried chicken, these baked chicken nuggets are made using the 3-station set up:I like to use the disposable aluminum pie plates for this process as they aren’t bulky or heavy, making it a breeze to set up. But any medium-sized dish with high sides will do.First, cut up a couple of boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. It can be hard to get them all the same size, but for even cooking that’s the goal. Fill the first plate with flour and seasonings (garlic powder, seasoned salt, kosher salt and pepper). In the second plate, whisk together melted butter and a couple of eggs (this will look a little weird but the butter definitely adds a nice flavor). For the third plate, it’s all about the walnuts. Crush the walnuts in a food processor (aff). You want to be careful not to crush them so fine it becomes a dust because that won’t result in a crispy exterior. You want them to be like fine chunks.Set up the stations side by side and use one hand for dry and one hand for wet. This will keep your hands cleaner. Coat the chicken in the flour, then in the egg/butter and finally in the walnuts. Arrange the chicken on a baking rack that you’ve set on top of a baking sheet. The goal of using the rack AND the sheet is to avoid having to turn the chicken nuggets over as they will get crunchy all the way around. You do want to make sure to spray the rack with nonstick cooking spray. My baked chicken nuggets took about 10 minutes to turn golden brown and be cooked all the way through. You might be able to get away with a little less time. That’s one of the benefits of making baked chicken nuggets – let time in the oven than a whole piece of chicken!Like I mentioned, I love these baked chicken nuggets with a honey mustard sauce.

141,"This Slow Cooker Shredded Chicken makes a ton and is perfect for portioning out and freezing. When your recipe calls for cooked chicken breast, you’ll already have some on hand – Everyone loves this easy meal prep idea!Making shredded chicken in the crock pot is a real time saver. Toss it in soups, casseroles, on tacos or in burritos. Any time your recipe calls for cooked chicken breast, all you have to do is pull the amount you need out of the freezer and it’s ready to go.It really couldn’t be easier, and it’s almost completely hands off if you want it to be! Slow Cookers are great for fix it and forget it type meals anyway – just dump in the ingredients, turn it on, and go. For this recipe, you just place the chicken in the slow cooker with some seasonings and a little chicken broth for flavor and moisture.          Timing is everything when you’re making chicken in the slow cooker. Too short and it can be tough, and too long and it can be dry. In my slow cooker it takes about 3 1/2 hours on high to get perfect shredded chicken that’s tender and juicy. Depending on your appliance (this is the one I use – aff link), it could take a little more or a little less time although I’d recommend not exceeding 4 hours on high. However, if it goes a little too long,  you can always shred the meat and place it back into the slow cooker with the juices and cook on low for another half hour. This is a good step to follow anyway; once the meat is shredded it loses valuable juices, and letting the shredded meat cook a little more in the juices and broth lets each piece soak up that moisture.I use a whole package (usually about 3 pounds) of fresh or frozen chicken (with frozen, you won’t need to add the chicken broth). I like to use salt, pepper and garlic powder for flavor, but you could leave out the garlic if you prefer, or add your favorites. Once cooked the meat is really easy to shred. There are three methods you can use when shredding chicken:My 3 pound packages usually give me around 7 cups of cooked, shredded chicken. I divide the meat into freezer bags in 1 or 2 cup portions and freeze until I’m ready to use it. It will keep for up to 4 months, but mine is usually long gone by then! Either way this method for making slow cooker shredded chicken is great for weekly meal prep or dinner prep.Here are some delicious recipes that call for precooked shredded chicken:And for more slow cooker recipes, try these:Disclosure – this post contains affiliate links.Hi!

142,"My Easy Baked Pork Chops are so tender and juicy, and the brown sugar spice rub gives this boneless pork chops a ton of flavor!I’ll be the first to admit, I’ve never really been a fan of boneless pork chops. They always seem like a good idea, but they come out of the oven dry and tough. But you know what I figured out? It wasn’t the pork’s fault! It was mine. I finally figured out that I was cooking the poor pork chops to death, and it was slow and painful.Here are a few tips I’ve learned about keeping this type of meat super tender and juicy without drying it out:I like to use a nice, thick boneless pork chop for this recipe – about 1-inch thick is perfect.Start by rinsing the pork and patting it dry. Place the pork chops in a large baking dish and rub with a little bit of olive oil.For the brown sugar spice blend, I took notes from my easy baked chicken breast recipe and basically just added some brown sugar. Pork stands up well to a sweet flavor profile (and I just kinda prefer it).Bake the pork chops in a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes. If you have a meat thermometer, (aff) it will come in handy here. You want the pork to register about 145 degrees.Now, it’s tempting to cut into the baked pork chops to see if they’re done – resist!!

It will get nice and thick as it continues to boil.Combine the cream of chicken sauce with sour cream and a packet of onion soup mix and set aside. By now the past should be cooked to al dente and drained, so go ahead and stir the pasta, chicken and green beans into the sauce so it’s all well combined and coated. Pour it all into a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish, cover with foil, and bake at 350 for about 25 minutes.

Once the sauce has started to reduce, add the pasta and let it simmer for several minutes. The starch from the pasta will help thicken the sauce and the boiling sauce will finish cooking the pasta – it’s a win-win! Once the sauce has reduced some more, add the veggies back in and toss it all around to coat everything in that simple, yummy sauce. Grate some fresh parmesan cheese on top and you’re ready to serve.Want to know what we serve with our Penne Pasta Primavera?

146,"This easy recipe for Baked Teriyaki Salmon is sure to become a family favorite. Nestled in crisp lettuce cups, these Teriyaki Salmon Lettuce Wraps are a protein-packed meal for lunch or dinner.      In my younger, pre-children days, some friends and I would frequent a local Japanese restaurant nearly every weekend. The food was phenomenal, and that’s really where my love of sushi began. Along with sushi, we would order the barbecued salmon (which had a sweet teriyaki flavor) and the tiger shrimp lettuce wraps with this incredible, creamy sauce. They were seriously amazing, and we would gorge ourselves to the point you’d think we would have rolled out of there.      This particular recipe is a bit of a combination of the barbecued salmon and the shrimp lettuce wraps. Small portions of salmon are marinated in a sweet, homemade teriyaki sauce for a good 30 minutes, or longer if you have the time.            Then the marinated teriyaki salmon is baked in the oven, while the remaining marinade is cooked on the stove-top to become a sweet glaze for the finished salmon. Toasted sesame seeds are completely optional, but really add a nice, slightly nutty flavor.      The salmon pieces are then cut in half (or not depending on the size of your lettuce cups), and placed on top of each lettuce cup. The finishing touch is that creamy sauce, which is really just a combination of mayo, soy sauce, ginger and honey.Baked Salmon Teriyaki is my absolute favorite way to eat salmon, in lettuce wraps like these, or just over a bed of rice. There is just something about that sweet sauce atop that mild fish that makes me beg for more! I seriously don’t make it enough…but I think I’m going to add it to our weekly menu starting today!

Cover the boil with plastic wrap or foil and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 20-30 minutes.Meanwhile, divide lettuce leaves, keeping each leaf in tact to form ""cups."" Wash gently and set aside on paper towels to dry.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a medium size baking dish with cooking spray. Arrange salmon (not touching) in the dish and bake for 12-16 minutes, reserving the sauce. Cooking time will depend on size and thickness; it's done when the salmon is a light pink color and is tender and flaky.While the salmon is baking, pour the sauce into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and stir often, until sauce is reduced and thickened; about 4-5 minutes. You will know it's done when it coats the back of a spoon. Set aside.Remove salmon from the oven. Pour thickened sauce over each piece and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion. If using for lettuce wraps, cut each piece in half.Arrange 8 lettuce cups on a platter and place half of each piece of salmon in the cups.

147,"Healthy Turkey Chili is a tasty, low effort meal that’s full of flavor for Football Game Day Celebrations or to have when you have everyone stopping by during the holidays!Hi everyone! I’m Michele from West Via Midwest and I’m sharing a healthy turkey chili recipe with you today. I don’t know about you, but things can get pretty hectic during the holidays and I seem to eat indulgently starting at Thanksgiving and then non-stop thru the New Year.I like to have a few healthier options like today’s Healthy Turkey Chili to make when having company over so I can feel guilt free when I’m eating all of the cookies that are around during the holidays like so many of these delicious Festive Christmas cookies.I call this Healthy Turkey Chili because it’s lower in fat than when I make it with beef because of this ground turkey recipe. But don’t worry— it’s not lacking in flavor at all. In fact most people have no idea that it’s made with turkey so when I’m serving it for company I just say would you like some delicious chili?The most important thing is to maximize the flavor of the meat and spices you use in the chili. You’ll brown the meat with the onions have them caramelized on a low slow heat (pictured here). This lets the meat absorb the onion flavors.That’s not all that you need to do for this Healthy Turkey Chili. You’ll also want all of the flavors of the spices infused into the turkey so that every spoonful has all of the great flavors in it. Once you have the onions and meat browned you will want to put all of the spices on top of the meat and let them have time to really get into the meat.After all of the spices have been stirred in you will add the tomatoes and the chicken broth (its ok to substitute vegetable broth if you prefer.) You’ll let the chili simmer for at least an hour and allow the liquids to reduce and all the flavors to really develop. It’s a great meal to let simmer all day on the stove if you have people wanting to eat at different times during the day.The last ingredient I add to this chili is a little bit of …… wait for it. Dark Chocolate. It deepens the flavor just a little, pairing beautifully with the chili powder but it also ads a velvety smooth texture to the broth. I promise, it’s really good.This Healthy Turkey Chili goes well with what ever toppings you like. Guacamole, Cheese, Sour Cream, Cheese, Salsa…. The list is endless. (another great way for your guests on game day to get their chili just the way they like it!)It also works really well if you have any leftovers as a topping on Sweet Potatoes so make a double batch for these. (like these Sweet Potato Starter Bites pictured here.)Here is another delicious chili recipe we love:Easy Chili Recipe {3 Ingredients}And here are a few more yummy chili recipes to try:Michele believes no matter how busy you are you can make great tasting food that people will rave about.

Seasoned turkey and black beans stuffed into crispy taco shells and topped with melted cheddar cheese – it’s dinnertime perfection!When it comes to dinnertime, quick and easy is the name of the game. And is there really anything tastier and easier than tacos? Pretty much no! We love tacos – chicken tacos, beef tacos, carnitas tacos…we love them all. Baked Tacos are my absolute favorite meal to cook, and I love to experiment with different types of meat and flavors.I have a shredded chicken and black bean version of these baked tacos, but ground turkey is so easy to work with and if you season it just right you won’t even miss the beef! Ground turkey recipes are much healthier than beef but have the same texture so it’s easy to swap it out without your family being any wiser!This easy meal idea starts with flavoring the ground turkey. This is the most important part in any ground turkey recipe because turkey on it’s own doesn’t have a ton of flavor. Adding onion, garlic and taco seasoning will provide a ton of Mexican flavor for your ground turkey and black bean baked tacos. Once the meat is cooked and seasoned, chicken broth is added to help the meat absorb the flavors and keep it from getting dry.Once the meat and black beans are cooked and coated in that delicious sauce, you can serve your tacos up right away or use my favorite method and create some yummy baked tacos.Tacos shells (these are our favorite [aff] but you could also make your own) are stuffed with the ground turkey and black bean mixture then topping with a generous helping of shredded cheese and baked to crispy, melty, golden perfection.

149,"This Turkey, Cranberry and Walnut Pasta Salad is a delicious lunch for the holiday season or any time of the year! Use up leftover turkey or swap out chicken instead. Thanks to California Walnuts for sponsoring this post.If you’re looking for a delicious, easy and good for you meal to fill up on this holiday season, in the midst of all the shopping and wrapping and baking and caroling, this is the recipe you’ve been waiting for! With tender pasta, tart cranberries, crunchy walnuts and a tangy sweet dressing, this pasta salad is perfect for feeding a crowd, or just when you need to refuel after all that holiday shopping.I am a huge fan of pasta salads. They are super easy, and really require just a few basic things.You can whip up a delicious pasta salad in no time at all, especially if you have leftovers on hand. The pasta should be a small, bite-sized pasta like macaroni, rotini or farfalle (butterfly). You’ll want to cut all of the ingredients for your pasta salad about the same size. This makes it easier to get all of those yummy flavors on your fork together.Start by cooking your pasta to al dente. This means it still has a little bit of a bite to it. You definitely don’t want overcooked pasta for your past salad. Make sure to salt the boiling water just before adding the dry pasta to give it flavor.While the pasta is cooking, prep the other ingredients and make the dressing. A good creamy dressing has 3 basic parts – creamy, acidic and sweet. The creaminess comes from a combination of mayonnaise and Greek yogurt. You could use all mayo, or all greek yogurt or even sour cream (or any combination of the three, depending on what you have on hand). Cider vinegar provides an acidic balance to the creaminess and honey gives a sweetness. The measurements here are general – feel free to adjust based on your liking.I love a little texture in my pasta salad, so walnuts provided the perfect crunch. Plus they have all sorts of health benefits! Walnuts are actually one of my favorite healthy snacks, so adding them to this pasta salad was a no-brainer.Combine all of the ingredients together in a big bowl and cover it and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.Hosting or attending a casual gathering this holiday season?

150,"Chopped Steaks with Mushroom Gravy – An easy recipe for tender and juicy hamburger steaks that are smothered in a delicious mushroom gravy! These chopped steaks and gravy are made simple in one pan and ready in less than 30 minutes.When it comes to comfort food, chopped steaks are one of my absolute favorites. We have a restaurant in my town that makes a really amazing hamburger steak and I order it as often as I can! But, eating out isn’t always that economical, nor do I always have the time. So, I had to create my own chopped steak and gravy at home. I have to say, I think they are even better than what the local restaurant serves!Besides the fact that I crave these steaks on a regular basis, I love making them at home during the busy holiday season because they are so quick and easy. When I’m busy prepping for holiday baking and meals, I don’t want to have to really think hard about our weeknight supper.Plus, I’m always looking for new and exciting things to do with that ground beef that’s hanging out in my refrigerator!Ingredient wise, I really consider everything here a “pantry staple.” These steaks can be described as kind of a mini meatloaf. But, they can be made right on your stovetop! No heating up the oven! Now, occasionally I don’t have the mushrooms to go along with this recipe. So if you don’t have them, or if you aren’t a fan, you can just simply leave them out!One thing you will notice with this recipe is that the chopped steaks get seared first on each side.  However, they won’t be completely cooked through.  That’s ok!  Set them aside on a plate and cover them with foil to keep warm while you whip up the gravy.  This gravy only takes five minutes to make, so your beef will stay nice and hot, no problem!After about 3-5 minutes your gravy will start to thicken up, at that point, you add your patties back to the pan.  Then, they simmer to super tender, juicy, flavorful perfection!I love serving these chopped steaks up with my Cream Cheese Mashed Potatoes for a truly decadent, unforgettable, weeknight meal!Here is another delicious hamburger recipe that we love:Hamburger SoupAnd here are a few more delicious ground beef recipes:","In a large bowl mix together the ground beef, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs.Form the meat mixture into 4 balls, then flatten into patties.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.Add the onions, mushrooms, and hamburger patties to the skillet.Fry the patties for about 4 minutes on each side.Remove to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.Sprinkle the flour over the onions and mushrooms in the skillet.  Stir the flour in, cooking for one minute.Slowly pour the beef broth into the skillet using a wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.Reduce heat to simmer and cook the gravy for 3-5 minutes until thickened.Add the patties back to the pan, simmer for 10 more minutes until beef is cooked through and gravy is thickened."

Perfect as a holiday appetizer or serve as a meal over rice.When it comes to easy appetizers for the holidays, meatballs are such an easy go-to. They can be coated in a variety of sauces, like these Cranberry Barbecue Meatballs, and they are bite-sized making them easy to grab with a toothpick or mini fork and just pop in your mouth.I love garlic in just about everything; I mean, if I could find a way to put garlic in a dessert I would totally rock that! Sweet flavors mesh so well with garlic because they tone it down a bit while still allowing the spiciness to shine through.This Honey Garlic Meatball Recipe is so easy, you’re going to be adding it to your holiday menus AND your weekly dinner rotation! The glaze is a simple sauce of garlic, honey, soy sauce, ketchup and brown sugar. These five ingredients are whisked together in a pot on the stove until they are nice and smooth and start to bubble. I also added some red pepper flakes and ground ginger for a spicy kick.The sauce is pretty thin at this point and you want it to be nice and thick so it coats the meatballs and sticks. I made a slurry with a equal parts of the sauce and cornstarch in a bowl. You could also do this with water, but I didn’t want to take away from the flavor.Once the slurry is added to the pot it doesn’t take long for it to thicken. Once the sauce is nice and thick and shiny, you can add the meatballs. Now, you can make some easy homemade meatballs, or you can use frozen. I personally prefer homemade, but in a pinch the frozen meatballs will do just fine (and they will save you a ton of time). The key here is to have the meatballs fully cooked and defrosted. Putting frozen meatballs in the warm sauce takes too long to bring them up to temperature and the sauce may burn.

It’s a classic dish with breaded chicken, cheese and tomato sauce usually served over pasta. It’s delicious, but it can take quite a bit of effort to prepare. That’s why these Chicken Parmesan Pinwheels are so perfect! Not only are they a great, simple weeknight dinner option, but they make a great party appetizer too.Like our other baked pinwheels, these Chicken Parmesan Pinwheels start with a sheet of dough. You can use either crescent dough or pizza dough from the refrigerator section of your grocery store.Top the dough with shredded chicken and tomato sauce, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses and Italian seasoning. Then carefully roll it up, starting with the longest side. You want to roll as tight as possible without squishing out the filling.Once it’s all nice and rolled up you can slice and bake right away but I recommend refrigerating for at least 30 minutes to make the log easier to slice. Use a sharp, serrated knife when you’re ready to cut the log into pinwheels shapes. Bake on a parchment or foil lined cookie sheet to keep the pinwheels from sticking.

156,"The fall and winter months are the perfect time to make this Instant Pot Chili recipe. All the taste of a slow cooked chili, but in just 30 minutes!Hi everyone! Amanda here from Old House to New Home, sharing an easy chili recipe that’s absolutely delicious. This recipe isn’t fancy and doesn’t have any unusual ingredients in it, just meat, beans, and vegetables. It is simple and classic and that is what I love about it! I love reinventing old favorites, but sometimes it is just nice to have a classic meal for dinner, isn’t it?While I may not have updated the ingredients in this chili recipe, I have modernized the process by using my new favorite kitchen tool, The Instant Pot. If you haven’t bought one yet, I can’t stress enough how much you need this little pot in your life. When I get home from work and want the enjoy the best chili ever, I know that I can throw all the ingredients into my Instant Pot, and have dinner quickly! Pressure cookers always intimidated me, but an electric pressure cooker is seriously fool proof. I love that I can brown my beef right in the pot too, so this is a one pot meal!I prefer to use a homemade mix of spices for this chili and love the flavor that the pressure cooker imparts on the meal. Depending on the salt content of your tomatoes, you may need to adjust the salt. I usually have to add about an tsp. after cooking. Feel free to adjust the spices. I am cooking for two little girls, so this chili isn’t very spicy. I love to add a little hot sauce to the tops of both mine and my husband’s! If you love spicy food, you could add a few dashes to the pot before it cooks!As the days cool down, I know we will be having this Instant Pot Chili for dinner again and again! Don’t have an instant pot? Dump all the ingredients into your slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours.Looking for more Instant Pot Recipes?Instant Pot Chicken Scampi Here is another Instant Pot recipe we love:Pressure Cooker or Instant Pot Lentil SoupAnd here are some more of the best chili recipes to try:","Turn your Instant Pot to the saute function. Once the screen says HOT add your oil. After 1 minute, add your ground beef. Cook for 5-6 minutes, breaking up the meat as it cooks.Once it is completely browned, add the cup of water and stir well to remove all of the beef from the bottom. Then, add all remaining ingredients, except for the spices. Stir well to incorporate all ingredients. Add the spices, reserving half the salt. Stir well. Put lid on the Instant Pot and turn the seal to sealed. Cancel the saute function and switch it to manual. Set the timer for 25 minutes. Let come to pressure and cook. Once timer beeps, do a quick release.Remove lid and stir chili. Taste and add additional spices, including salt, if necessary. Let the chili sit for about 10 minutes as it will be boiling hot after cooking. As it sits, it will help thicken. Serve over noodles or rice."
157,"This Classic Meatloaf recipe was my dad’s claim to fame, at least in our house! It’s tender and juicy and has a uniquely delicious flavor. The brown sugar and ketchup glaze just puts this meatloaf over the top!When I was in about 5th grade, my dad was put on permanent disability due to some health issues. So my mom was the one who went to work and my dad stayed at home. It was an unusual dynamic in those days (which makes me sound very old). When I was a kid it was becoming common for both parents to be working and it was really unusual to have a parent at home, my less the dad.This post may contain affiliate links.Given our family dynamic, my dad was the one who did a lot of the cooking. He had a few specialties though, that I remember fondly and love to recreate, like this classic meatloaf recipe. It’s a simple meatloaf recipe, but he definitely had his own twist to it. For example he used Porterhouse Seasoning, which I don’t see a lot of now but you can find it in the spice blends section of your grocery store. It’s a great dry rub for meats, especially beef and is a blend of salt, garlic, onion, black pepper, oregano, paprika, parsley, celery, rosemary.My dad made the best meatloaf, but it was just slightly different each time depending on what we had on hand. One of the big swaps he would use is oats versus crackers. If you are going to use oats in your meatloaf you want to use Quick Cook Oats; the regular oats just won’t work the same. But most often he used crushed up crackers, like Ritz or Townhouse. That’s how I’m writing the recipe, but you can swap out for another binder like the oats or even breadcrumbs if you like. The biggest flavor bump in this meatloaf recipe is the Porterhouse Seasoning. If you can’t find it you can sort of put together your own or use a similar spice blend…or just plain salt and pepper if you like.One of the keys to a good meatloaf is the mixing – do not over-mix or you could end of with a tough meatloaf. I like to add a glaze to the top although my dad didn’t do this. I think he kind of like the crunchy bits you end up with on top. But the glaze helps to keep the top moist and tender and adds a delicious bit of flavor, so it’s my little twist to Dad’s Classic Meatloaf Recipe.One of my biggest pet peeves about meatloaf is when the juices all pool at the bottom and soak up into the meatloaf at the bottom making it a little greasy. I recently purchased a Meatloaf Pan (seen above) and I love it! It was pretty affordable and is a great tool to have if you have a family of meatloaf lovers like we do. It also makes it really easy to lift the meatloaf out of the pan to slice.Here’s another ground beef recipe we love:Hamburger SoupAnd for even more classic ground beef recipes, try these:Hi!

Do not overmix - The less you mess with it, the better it will be!Shape into a loaf and place into a loaf pan.In a small bowl combine 1/2 cup ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. Brush about 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the meatloaf.Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, then pour remaining sauce over the meatloaf. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 15-25 minutes or until meatloaf is completely cooked through. Meat should register between 155 and 160 degrees F.Let stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with parsley if desired."
158,"There’s nothing more comforting than a hot bowl of soup on a cold night. Nothing, that is, except this amazingly Simple Beef Stew. Chock full of tender chunks of beef and vegetables, this is a hearty bowl of savory goodness that will satisfy even the hungriest appetites.I have always had a love hate relationship with beef stew. I love the flavor, the way it warms you up and fills your belly. But I hate making it. For some reason it’s one of those things that I always thought was just too complicated so I wouldn’t bother with it. Then I got over it and made it and it was the BEST. THING. EVER.Kind of like soup, there’s no definitive “right” or “wrong” way to make beef stew. It’s basically meat and vegetables in gravy. Once you break it down like that, it becomes pretty simple!The key to a good stew is getting the meat right. You can use different cuts of beef depending on the time you have. Traditionally, chuck roast is used for beef stew. But chuck is a tougher cut of meat, albeit more flavorful because of it’s higher fat content. To cook the chuck you’d want at least an hour to an hour and a half. More tender cuts of beef, like sirloin can be used to get a quick stew in 30 minutes or so. Since the meat is more tender already, it doesn’t need the traditional low and slow cooking time that a chuck roast does. However it doesn’t have the same fat ratio so it’s not as flavorful.I always use chuck and I’m willing to wait it out because I feel like the flavor is so much richer and the meat so much more tender. Try it for yourself – I think you’ll agree!For more delicious comfort food meals, try these:Hearty Chicken SoupOne Pot Stovetop LasagnaTortellini Soup with Spinach and Italian SausageFor all dinner recipes go HERE, and for all recipes, go HERE.Hi!

159,"This Pumpkin, Corn and Potato Chowder is the perfect cold weather comfort food. Full of rich, earthy fall flavors, it’s a surprising delicious and hearty bowl of soup that you can’t get enough of.We are full-on into soup season no matter where you are in the US. Even here in Southern California we are enjoying the cooler evenings with a hearty bowl of homemade soup at least once a week. My new favorite is this amazing Pumpkin Corn & Potato Chowder. It’s rich and creamy and literally tastes like fall. The pumpkin is super rich and earthy and is a perfect match with the tender potatoes and sweet corn.If you’re looking for a healthier chowder recipe, this is it. While traditional chowders are thickened with lots of flour and heavy cream, this Pumpkin Corn Potato Chowder is naturally thickened with starchy potatoes and pureed pumpkin. I wanted a slightly creamier flavor and texture so I added just a half of a cup of heavy cream but you could save those calories and serve it without if you like.I recently spent a few days in the corn fields of Iowa on an amazing trip sponsored by Iowa Corn. There we met farmers and their families who are living their dream of farming every single day. I learned a ton on this trip! Corn isn’t just a side dish to serve at your dinner table – it feeds pigs and cattle and fuels cars, too! It’s also used as a starch or thickener, for oils and sweeteners and in many foods that we eat every day. When I thought of corn fields I thought of the corn that I picked up at the grocery store and grilled up on my barbecue or turned into my yummy Cheesy Hot Corn Dip. I never realized how many uses there really are. I also learned a few interesting things about corn and GMOs.          You may have heard the term GMO or seen it on packages at your grocery store. But do you know what it means in terms of corn production? Farming has changed dramatically over the years, including the way they keep bugs off their precious golden stalks of corn. GMO stands for genetically modified organism and refers to a crop that has been changed to improve it’s ability to survive, using scientists understanding of corn’s DNA. The technique of genetic modification can also be referred to as genetic engineering. When it comes to genetically modified corn, there are different types. One example being corn that has been modified to include a protein that is toxic to certain insects which ravage farmers’ fields. Because scientists understand the genetic differences between plants, animals and humans, they have pinpointed a protein that is poisonous for the insect that damages crops – but that same protein has no effect on other insects, humans or animals that eat it. The presence of this protein means farmers don’t have to use a pesticide to battle that bug, because the plant can fend off that bug already.Besides just being a beautiful part of the country and a leader in corn production, Iowa is home to several distilleries! We were treated to an incredible meal and some delicious cocktails at the Iowa Distilling Company. If you’re ever near Des Moines, you have got to pay a trip to this adorable little place. So cute!          I think if there is one idea that I came away with on this trip it’s that you are responsible for doing the research to decide what is best for your family. But that requires doing the research! Don’t just take my word for it, or your friend’s post on facebook. Do the research, read articles about food production, GMOs and more from reputable publications like universities and hospitals who can provide data to back up their food science research.Here are a few resources to get you started:Oh, and enjoy this Pumpkin, Corn and Potato Chowder. It’s pretty darn amazing.Want to know what our favorite corn recipe is?

Chili is a perfect weeknight meal or tailgating recipe.      It’s one of the easiest dishes to make, too! You need three ingredients to start, and then you can kick it up to make it your own. You’ll need a pound of ground beef, a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes with chili spices and a 15 ounce can of chili beans. Mix it together in a pot and simmer. The longer you are able to let it simmer, the better it gets. But you can also serve it as soon as it’s hot. You could also let this cook in the crockpot on low for several hours, just be sure to cook the ground beef first.At this point, you have a great bowl of thick and hearty chili. It serves four to six people and has a great flavor just on it’s own. But sometimes I like to get creative, and I’ll add in some extra ingredients to make it even better. Here are a few other ideas to spice up your chili –When adding different ingredients, the key is to keep the ratios. 1 pound of meat, 1 can of beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes. If it’s too thick, just add a small can of tomato sauce, along with a little chili powder.My favorite way to kick up this recipe is by adding a can of black beans, a can of tomato sauce, and a little chili powder.

You have a thick layer of pasta, dotted with chicken parmesan meatballs, and then covered in yummy provolone and Parmesan cheeses!

If you have time, let your meatballs simmer in the sauce before assembling the casserole. It will impart more flavor and moisture, but it is definitely not a mandatory step if you don’t have the time!Entertaining tip! You can see that there are only six meatballs pictured in the photos here, while the recipe makes many more. Whenever I have guests over, I split the recipe in half and put it into smaller casseroles so that we have more than one serving bowl.

But after posting a quick pic I snapped with my phone on Instagram, lots of people wanted the recipe. So I went ahead and posted it with that crummy iPhone photo, figuring I’d make it again and get some better shots. That was two and a half years ago and that crummy photo has been pinned nearly 300,000 times!I shared this photo on Instagram (you’re following me there, right?) and I wasn’t planning to share it on the blog so I didn’t take a decent photo. But several people asked for the recipe, so I figured I better share it!I used the bag of shredded Parmesan, not the grated in a can stuff, which is what gave that nice crispy texture. I imagine fresh grated would be even more delicious.My daughter loved this the first time I made it, but my son wasn’t as convinced. In fact, he hated it. This time around however, he must have a more evolved palate because he LOVED it. After he gobbled it down I reminded him that he hated it the first time I’d made it. His response? “I’m in second grade now so my tastebuds have changed.” Touché.Doesn’t that look delicious. I love what Chef Anne Berell says – “Brown food tastes good!” It’s definitely true here. This chicken is tender and juicy, and the topping is slightly crunchy. I’ve seen a lot of recipes for Parmesan Ranch Chicken, but they all call for dry Ranch seasoning, which is super salty and really gives an overpowering Ranch flavor. Which is fine if that’s what you’re after, but I prefer a subtle Ranch flavor taking a backseat and letting the Parmesan be the star.

It truly is the perfect cozy-night-in kind of meal. Take out the sausage and it would also make a great Thanksgiving side dish!What I love about sheet pan dinners is they are crazy easy. Chop up the meat and veggies, coat them in a sauce or seasonings and bake, stirring a few times throughout the process. This particular meal takes about 50 minutes but it’s also pretty forgiving if you cook it a little over or under. You just want all of the veggies to be nice and tender.

168,"There are plenty of times that dinner feels overwhelming–you need something fast, but you also want it to be healthy and use fresh ingredients. After all, you can only eat so much macaroni and cheese. That’s where a dish like this Sheet Pan Lemon Dill Salmon with Roasted Tomatoes will fit perfectly. I don’t know when the idea of “sheet pan suppers” became trendy–honestly, they are a thing but they aren’t a new thing. Smart home cooks have been tossing ingredients on pans and baking them together for decades–all you need are a few items that cook in the same amount of time for a fast no-fuss dinner.In this case, we’re taking fresh fish to a new level as we add lemon, dill and the glorious taste of roasted tomatoes.As I was snacking on these after the food was cooked I thought to myself “I sure hope God has roasted tomatoes in heaven.”I’m all about a roasted tomato, and here the roasting process condenses their sweetness and concentrates the flavor so you get big flavor with very little effort. You can even use the juice that bakes out to flavor other side dishes like thin green beans (you can bake them with this dish as well) or couscous.Or you could just drink it with a straw. No judgment here.If you can’t get fresh tomatoes, use something like a grape tomato from the store–they’ll work fine.This particular batch of beauties came from my garden.I prefer an Alaskan salmon here–if you can find it, try to avoid the pale, almost white salmon you may find in your freezer section. I can’t help but wonder where that stuff even came from.Now don’t get me wrong, frozen fish is fine and is often fresher if you don’t live in an area where you can get it fresh. It’s what I use. I just make sure it’s good quality. Salmon should be pink or red in color, firm (not mushy) to the touch, and not smell like fish.Simply layer the ingredients on to your lemon and dill salmon with roasted tomatoes, give it a toss and bake it up. It couldn’t be simpler and it’s full of vitamins and healthy protein.Not to mention there’s hardly anything to clean up.It’s the best of all worlds y’all. Enjoy and get ready to clean your plates and lick your fingers. Want more fresh meal ideas?

Nichole here from The Salty Marshmallow! I’m super excited to be doing some contributing posts in the upcoming months here at Yellow Bliss Road!Today I’m sharing my recipe for a really simple Lemon Pepper Shrimp! My idea of a perfect dinner is one that requires minimal ingredients that produce maximum flavor, and if we can get away with fewer dishes, that’s always a win too!One of my other quick, weeknight, dinner winners is this Crockpot Frito Chili Pie!Ok, let’s talk shrimp! This recipe calls for one sheet pan, and one medium sized bowl for mixing up the mouth-watering sauce for the shrimp.Most of the spices involved you probably already have on hand.  We use salt, garlic (you can use powder or fresh minced), paprika, and of course lots of black pepper!One thing I love about this recipe is that it’s super versatile.  We often make a simple meal out of just this shrimp with a big salad on the side.It’s also amazing served over pasta or rice, and you can double the sauce if you want extra!I’ve also been known to whip this up for game day parties in the fall!  It’s honestly really great served warm, or cold, and people can’t get enough of it.It’s a refreshing change to have something a little healthier and lighter at gatherings.  But, it can still definitely hold it’s own flavor wise!  Even next to more decadent recipes like Key Lime Pie Cheesecake Dip!However you decide to serve this, it’s a total winner of a hassle-free, crowd pleasing shrimp dish!Here’s another shrimp dish we love:Garlic Shrimp & Tomato SpaghettiAnd for more great sheet pan dinners, try these:","Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a non-stick sheet pan with oil or nonstick cooking spray and set aside.In a medium bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, pepper, salt, and paprika.Add the shrimp to the bowl and gently stir with a spoon to coat.Spread the shrimp evenly on the prepared baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, just until shrimp has turned pink and is firm. Serve as a meal with a salad, or on top of rice or pasta. Also great as a cold appetizer!"

171,"Bacon Ranch Macaroni & Cheese is perfect for game day but quick enough to enjoy for dinner with your family on a busy weeknight!Hi! My name is Jessy and I blog over at The Life Jolie. I’m so excited to share some recipes here with you at Yellow Bliss Road!Mac and Cheese has been a favorite food of mine since I was a little girl. I mean, is there anything more comforting than creamy, savory pasta? When I was a kid, my mom would sometimes make frozen mac and cheese and my absolute favorite part was the slightly crispy crust that would form on the corners of the container. I always made a point to be the first one at the table in hopes of getting all those perfect corners to myself!My husband Justin is something of a picky eater, which can be challenging for me, since I love to sample a wide variety of foods. But in addition to enjoying mac and cheese, he and I both share a love for bacon and ranch dressing (in fact, I grew to love ranch because he loved it so much!). And since I’m always looking for ways to add a fun twist to classic recipes, Bacon Ranch Baked Macaroni and Cheese seemed like a natural next step.This dish is the creamy and delicious mac and cheese that dreams are made of! The bacon brings a savory smokiness and the hint of zest from the ranch seasoning kicked the whole recipe up a notch without being overpowering.I sprinkled some extra cheese on top at the beginning with a generous portion of panko breadcrumbs and some crumbled bacon to achieve that crispy crust that I loved all those years ago in every serving. If you’re looking for a more melty-cheese on top, simply wait to add the toppings until 5 minutes before it’s done baking.This fun variation will definitely be making some appearances during football season this year. But it’s also quick an easy enough to make a comforting and heart weeknight dinner this fall. It’s definitely best right out of the oven and can easily be doubled to feed a crowd. Your family will be fighting for that second helping!Make it a full meal with these other tasty options:Nanou’s Garlic Green Beans      No-Bake S’mores Bars      Here’s another great Mac & Cheese Recipe that our family loves:Chicken, Bacon and Blue Macaroni and CheeseFor more easy weeknight dinner recipes, try these:Jessy","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.In a medium size pan, melt butter over medium heat.Add flour and whisk to make a roux.

173,"My One Pan Creamy Tortellini and Smoked Sausage is a match made in heaven! It’s a delicious one pan meal that combines the tender, cheese filled pasta with savory smokey sausage and wraps it all in a creamy cheesy tomato sauce. One bite and you’ll wonder where it’s been all your life!*This recipe was originally posted in 2014 and has been updated for 2017.One Pan Meals have long provided record breaking traffic to the blog. People really fell in love with the One Pan Cheesy Smoked Sausage Pasta and others like my One Pan Caprese Pasta and One Pan Beef Stroganoff (my personal favorite).I did make one small change to the recipe this time around (but left both versions in the printable recipe). I had originally used a big can of whole tomatoes that you cut up yourself in the can, but I’ve found that I prefer crushed tomatoes. Using crushed eliminates a step, and they taste just as fresh if you use a good quality brand like San Marzano.So really it’s not a huge change and you can stick with whatever type of tomatoes you prefer.To make the One Pan Creamy Tortellini and Smoked Sausage, start by cooking up the smoked sausage with some fragrant diced onions and a little garlic. That alone will make your kitchen smell divine and you might want to just start picking them out of the pan and eating them one by one. But refrain! You’re so close because this recipe is incredibly easy.Once the onions are soft and the sausage is browned, you add in the rest of the ingredients (minus the cheese) – Refrigerated Tortellini (whatever flavor you prefer), a 20 oz can of crushed tomatoes or cut up whole tomatoes (use your kitchen scissors and cut them up right in the can), a cup of chicken broth or water, and salt and pepper. Give it a few quick stirs while you let it come to a boil. Then cover it up and simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Alternatively, you could leave the lid off while it simmers at a higher heat, stirring often, to cook it a little faster.Once the pasta is tender, you just add in the cheeses. The sauce will seem thin, but will thicken as it sits. Cover to allow the cheese time to melt, then serve hot.This is one that I will definitely be adding to my monthly meal plan, because my kids LOVED it! You can kick it up a little by adding two cans of Rotel Tomatoes instead of the whole canned tomatoes, too. If not for my picky kiddos, I would have added a couple big handfuls of spinach.This post contains affiliate links.

Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened; 3-4 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add sausage and cook until browned on both sides.Stir in chicken broth, tortellini, tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until pasta is tender, stirring at least once to prevent sticking. *There should still be liquid in the pan to make the sauce, but if it seems excessive, you can remove some with a large spoon. (If you want a quicker cooking method, set at medium-low heat, uncovered, stirring often for about 8-10 minutes).*If there is too much liquid left in the pan, spoon some out. But be sure to leave enough behind to make the sauce.Remove from heat and stir in cheeses, reserving a handful for sprinkling on top. Cover and let stand for five to ten minutes, or broil for 2-3 minutes to brown. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired."
174,"This Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta, with a spicy homemade cajun seasoning coating the chicken and swirled into the creamy sauce, is sure to become an instant favorite for weeknight dinners.If you’ve never tried cajun seasoning, this recipe is the perfect way to ease into it. I was always scared of it because I am a complete wimp when it comes to spicy food. However, once I tried this flavorful seasoning, there was no turning back and it quickly became a favorite.I’m not usually one to buy lots of different spice mixes – I prefer to make my own. It’s so much cheaper and it’s so easy if you have a full spice cabinet like I do. My homemade cajun seasoning is a mix of onion powder, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. I did quite a bit of research and tried different recipe before finally settling on a mix that was super flavorful but not too spicy that I couldn’t handle it. If you prefer, you can add salt to the seasoning mix (I’ll include that as optional in the recipe below), but I prefer to season my meat directly with salt so I know exactly how much it’s getting.           With a dry run like this, there’s no reason to really marinate the chicken. Just season with salt and the homemade cajun seasoning and cook it up in a skillet. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and make the sauce right there in the same skillet. This is the part where that lovely cajun seasoning is swirled in with the creamy sauce to flavor it – not a lot but just enough to give it a nice boost of flavor.The sauce itself is similar to an alfredo but not quite as cheesy, and it’s not a tradition butter/cream sauce. The pasta is cooked separately, and once the sauce is ready both the chicken and the pasta are tossed with the sauce to make this lovely Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta.I loved this Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta so much that I made the recipe in the morning and had it for lunch, then ate it again for dinner with my family! It was THAT good! To reheat I just added a little more milk and chicken broth and heated it slowly on the stove. If you prefer to reheat in the microwave, add about 1-2 tablespoons of milk per cup of pasta and reheat at 50% power. This will keep it nice and creamy and won’t dry out the chicken.I was a little surprised at how much my family enjoyed this meal. But with it’s creamy sauce, tender pasta and spicy chicken with that homemade cajun seasoning that really packs a punch, how could they not?!

175,"It doesn’t get much easier than these savory Lemon Garlic Roasted Chicken Drumsticks. They are full of lemon and herb flavor and practically fall off the bone tender and juicy.Most of my life I’ve been a boneless, skinless white meat kind of girl. I think it’s because meat on the bone freaks me out. But in the past couple of years I have learned to appreciate the flavor packed bone-in dark meat of the thigh and drumstick. That’s probably because my son is pretty much obsessed with chicken on the bone.Upon hearing that dinner is “chicken again??” his next question is, “Wait. Is it on the bone?” A “yes” is met with a cheer while a “nope, sorry” is met with a rather impressive groan. So I’ve been trying to constantly come up with new ways to serve this favorite meat. Our latest favorite is this Roasted Lemon Chicken.An overnight marinade makes this chicken practically fall off the bone tender, however if you don’t have overnight, you could go 30 minutes. Just remember that the longer it marinates, the more tender it will be. I have a lemon tree, so lemons are readily available all year round for us so I love to use them in my chicken recipes. The lemon flavor is so subtle and doesn’t overpower the rest of the marinade, which, in case you were wondering, is olive oil, salt and pepper, oregano and paprika. I am also a little obsessed with chopped parsley, partly for the fresh herbiness (yup, totally a word) and partly because it just looks so darn pretty.Here’s another family favorite easy baked chicken recipe:Baked Lemon ChickenFor more delicious chicken recipes, try these:Chicken Parmesan Baked ZitiHoney Lemon Chicken and Green BeansSavory Broiled Garlic ChickenHi!

Pour over chicken and seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage marinade into the chicken. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Arrange chicken on a foil lined baking sheet. Bake, uncovered, for about 20-25 minutes. Flip chicken pieces and cook another 10 minutes, or until chicken reaches an internal temp of 165 F and is no longer pink.Serve immediately."
176,"This Easy BLT Pasta Salad is full of delicious flavors! Bacon, tomatoes, spinach, pasta and a creamy ranch dressing come together to make everyone’s favorite sandwich into pasta salad form!      If I had to pick one summer side dish to eat all year long, it would definitely be pasta salad. I seriously cannot get enough of it and love the versatility. There are just so many ways to make pasta salad so it never gets old! I usually prefer my pasta salad with an oil based dressing, but last year, my sister in law made this delicious BLT Pasta Salad for a picnic and I have been thinking of it ever since!I am not much of a sandwich eater, but I do love a good BLT! There is nothing like a garden fresh tomato, with crispy bacon, and cold lettuce. When I was putting together this salad, I didn’t love the idea of lettuce sitting in the pasta for a few hours in the fridge, so I subbed spinach. The spinach is so much heartier and doesn’t wilt as quickly and adds a big punch of nutrition to this dish! It also adds some great color so you have a beautiful bowl of pasta salad to serve!I debated on what to do for the dressing here. I don’t usually do creamy dressings so this was out of my comfort zone but I think I came up with a winning combination! A little mayo, a little dijon, and tangy ranch dressing. I even threw in just a smidge of bottled Italian dressing for some extra flavor and to thin out the dressing a little.I served this easy dish for dinner and both my husband and I loved it, but the true shocker was that my five year old was in love with this meal! She is a pretty good eater, but she isn’t a fan of anything creamy. She doesn’t even like macaroni and cheese! So I was floored when she asked to try it and then loved it! You know a recipe is a winner when you can convert a five year old!BLT Pasta Salad is the perfect side dish for your next BBQ or when you are looking for an easy dinner side dish!

178,"This Teriyaki Barbecue Pineapple Chicken Sheet Pan Dinner is a quick and easy meal that’s sweet and savory and gets dinner on the table in minutes!Don’t you love it when you can get a complete meal made in one pan? I know I do, especially when that meal is as easy as this Teriyaki Barbecue Pineapple Chicken Sheet Pan Dinner. This is a great dinner that can easily use up any leftover veggies you have in the fridge, too.First step is to make a simple marinade for the chicken and veggies. The base for the marinade is just your favorite barbecue sauce combined with some soy sauce, honey, garlic and pineapple juice. After chopping a bunch of chicken and vegetables, just toss it all together with the marinade – easy peasy! About half of the marinade is going to be simmered on the stove to make a sauce for the Teriyaki Barbecue Pineapple Chicken, so be sure to note that in the instructions.After after 30 minutes (or more if you have the time) everything gets arranged on a sheet pan and baked in the oven for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile the sauce is simmered and thickened, then drizzled over the chicken and vegetables about halfway through their cooking time. As it finishes cooking, the sauce gets nice and caramelized and just the gorgeous golden brown color.This sheet pan dinner is wonderful just on it’s own but can also be served with rice, quinoa or noodles. *Note, there maybe a lot of liquid in the pan from the marinade and the pineapple; just simple spoon it out, bot it with a paper towel or drizzle over the dish as you serve it.Love this Teriyaki Barbecue Pineapple Chicken Sheet Pan Dinner?

Place into a large zip-top bag.Drain pineapple, reserving 1/2 cup of the juice, and add to the vegetables and chicken in the zip-top bag. Whisk together marinade ingredients in a small bowl.

Set in the fridge to marinate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove chicken and vegetables from the bag and arrange in a single layer on a large sheet pan, discarding any remaining marinade. (Use tongs or a slotted spoon for this; do not pour onto the tray.

I just used paper towels to soak up most of it, then stirred everything together). Pour the thickened sauce evenly over the top of the chicken and vegetables. Slide back into the oven under the preheated broiler for about 5-7 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and meat and veggies are browned. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, if desired, and serve with rice or noodles. "
179,"This Lemon Garlic Chicken and Vegetable Pasta is my new go-to for quick meal prep or a simple, delicious weeknight dinner. It’s totally customizable with different veggies, too!I have to admit, I’m not a meal prep kind of girl. I am more of a “what sounds good right now” kind of cook. I’ll be scrolling through facebook or hear a commercial on the radio and see or hear something that looks delicious and immediately I will change my plans and make it, no matter what I’d already taken out of the freezer.So I was pleasantly surprised when this meal ended up being perfect for meal prepping! My Lemon Garlic Chicken and Vegetable Pasta has tons of flavor, no butter and lots of protein and veggies. There’s pasta in there too, because, c’mon, it’s me.This is one of those dishes that I saw in a video when scrolling facebook one day. It looked easy enough and sounded pretty amazing so I figured I’d give it a try. I did change up a few of the ingredients based on what I had on hand and I dare to say that this is even better than the recipe I originally had found.The veggies in this dish are totally customizable; I had carrots, squash and zucchini, along with some spinach. I think this would be great with broccoli or green beans or maybe some tomatoes added in at the end. I like a lot of lemon flavor so I added more lemon juice and some zest in there with the garlic; you could add more or less depending on your taste.               The key with this Lemon Garlic Chicken and Vegetable Pasta is adding layers of flavors. You’ll see in the recipe that seasonings are adding at several different stages. This really helps to flavor each part of the dish and helps the flavors all play nicely together.I was able to get about 5 lunches out of this pan of Lemon Garlic Chicken and Vegetable Pasta, which enough for a whole week! Or, serve it for dinner…depending on your family you should be able to get at least 4-6 servings. *One tip to note, chicken doesn’t like the microwave, so if you choose to reheat a portion of this meal, be sure to use the 50% power setting.Love this easy recipe?

181,"This Barbecue Chicken, Pineapple and Bacon French Bread Pizza is full of tangy barbecue flavor and topped with melty cheeses, sweet pineapple, tender veggies and crunchy bacon.As you well know if you’re a regular reader, I’m a big fan of keeping it simple and keeping it easy. This recipe is both of those things! Like all good things, it starts with a loaf of bread. Now here’s where we get a little tricky on the name…some might call it “french bread pizza” and some will call it “stuffed bread.” I did hollow out the center a bit so it could go either way. But you feel free to call it whatever you like as long as you make it, and soon!         Friday nights are often little or no cook nights around here and I love making french bread pizzas, and especially my Sloppy Joe French Bread Pizza. They are quick and easy and they lend themselves to virtually any flavor you throw at them.I am a huge fan of barbecue and pineapple flavors mixed with smoky bacon, but I’ve never tried that combo out in this stuffed bread form. It was time.I did hollow out the bread a bit, just not a ton because I do still like a thicker crust. I made a sauce using bottled barbecue sauce mixed with some mayo for creaminess and just brushed it all over the bread. *Sidenote, this makes an excellent dip for chicken nuggets!I like to layer my french bread pizzas with lots of cheese, so I put a layer of mozzarella and jack cheeses, then added some chicken, pineapple and veggies, and more cheese. Finally I topped it with bacon, the rest of the cheese and just a few pieces of chicken on top.These french bread pizzas bake up pretty quick in a nice hot oven – just 10-12 minutes at 400 degrees. The cheese gets all creamy and melty and the chicken on top gets a few nice charred bits. I mixed up a little more of the sauce and drizzled that over the tops of the slices for a finishing touch when I served them.         Overall, this was a quick, easy and delicious meal that everyone loved, and I’ll definitely be making it again!Love this Barbecue Chicken, Pineapple and Bacon French Bread Pizza?

182,"This Creamy Lemon Artichoke Tortellini Skillet is tender and cheesy and full of lemon-y flavor. Ready in just 20 minutes, it’s a delicious dinner any night of the week.We recently took an amazing cruise from Vancouver through the Inside Passage of Alaska. The views were spectacular, the air was cool and crisp, and the food was to die for. Despite there being world class meals available each night, the meal I remember most as my favorite of the cruise, was a Lemon Artichoke Ravioli. Tender ravioli stuffed with artichokes and cheese smothered in a creamy lemon sauce. It was just amazing.I knew immediately that it was something I wanted to recreate at home but the artichoke ravioli had me stumped. It wasn’t something I could just pick up at the local grocery store and I certainly wasn’t going to be (gasp) making my own from scratch. So I put my thinking cap on and on the flight home I jotted down my ideas for this recipe.As simple as basic cheese tortellini might seem, the cream and the lemon and the artichokes and Parmesan all work together in beautiful harmony to create this dish that might just become my signature. The cream is nicely offset by the acid from the lemon and the Parmesan cheese is the perfect finishing touch. It’s such a versatile dish too – you can add some protein like chicken or sausage, or some spinach would be great as well.I was so excited to make this Creamy Lemon Artichoke Tortellini Skillet that I made it literally the first day we were back home.

It’s sure to be a crowd-pleaser for summer parties and game day tailgating!         I am a sucker for hot wings, ever since I discovered them at this little local dive back in my early 20s.

185,"This Hawaiian Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad is full of things that will remind you of a tropical island getaway, like juicy pineapple and mango, crunch macadamia nuts and a tangy, creamy pineapple barbecue dressing. We try to plan a Hawaiian vacation at least once every couple of years. It’s the most relaxing vacation you can imagine, palm trees swaying, the ocean waves gently pounding the shore, and the food. Oh my goodness the food! If you’ve read about our most recent Hawaiian vacation at Disney’s Aulani Resort HERE then you have seen some photos of the amazing food at that resort. But there is amazing food everywhere. I’ve shared some of my favorite Hawaiian recipes HERE and HERE. But I think this Hawaiian Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad is my new favorite. There are bright, crunchy veggies, tender chicken pieces with a sweet and smoky barbecue marinade, macadamia nuts, sesame seeds, and tropical fruits of your choice – I love it with pineapple and mango. The creamy pineapple barbecue dressing has a Greek yogurt base with some mayo and sour cream for added creamy texture, pineapple juice and my new favorite barbecue sauce – Heinz Sweet & Smoky Hawaiian Style BBQ Sauce (no this isn’t a sponsored post, I just really loved it!). The sauce is all natural which, if you read labels,not all of them are. It’s just really delicious and adds a nice smoky flavor to both the chicken and the dressing.My inspiration for this Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad came from my love of Hawaiian flavors and my love of the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad from CPK! I mashed the two together and this delightful tropical salad was born. It’s very customizable, as most salads are, so if you don’t love mango, leave it out, or feel free to use almonds instead of macadamia nuts. Do what you love, just make sure you try this salad.

Store the remaining marinade in a sealed container in the fridge for serving with your meal.Heat about a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet (I recommend nonstick because of the sugar in the barbecue sauce) over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the sealed bag and discard any remaining marinade. Cook the chicken, flipping once, until no longer pink (about 4 minutes per side). Transfer to a plate and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, whisk the creamy pineapple bbq dressing ingredients together in a small bowl until thick and well combined.Toss chicken, lettuce, cabbage, carrot, pineapple, mango and green onion together in a large bowl with the Pineapple BBQ Dressing.

186,"This Red, White and Blue Cheese Potato Salad is the perfect side dish to amp up your summer picnic or backyard barbecue, and it’s the best thing to serve alongside some delicious Johnsonville Brats cooked on the new Sizzling Sausage Griller this Father’s Day! (sponsored)Blue Cheese is probably my favorite cheese. I have been putting blue cheese on everything lately, from BLTs to Deviled Eggs. I had the idea for this salad at 30,000 feet, working from an airplane on the way to a conference. I was brainstorming recipes that incorporate “red, white and blue” and this Red, White and Blue Cheese Potato Salad was the perfect fit. It’s super creamy, made with mayo and sour cream, and it’s got tons of salty flavor from the blue cheese and of course bacon. Potato Salad is the perfect accompaniment to some delicious sausage and is the perfect picnic food.I recently was given the opportunity to test out the new Johnsonville Sizzling Sausage Griller, which is a fun new kitchen tool that makes a perfect gift for Dad this Father’s Day. The grill has an enclosed design that seals completely when locked so that the sausages are cooked and browned evenly, the juices and flavor don’t escape, and no drippings splatter outside the grill. Plus it’s got a thermometer built in so no more guesswork – this appliance tells you when your sausages are fully cooked!If you happened to catch my insta-stories, we cooked up some Brats the other day with the new griller, because being the good Germans we are, brats are a family favorite. My grandma ate bratwurst at least once a month, traveling a good distance to the nearest German butcher to pick up her favorites. Once Johnsonville Brats were introduced in her grocery store, those trips became fewer and far between because she loved being able to grab them on her regular Friday shopping trips. She would have loved this sausage griller too! It works with any Johnsonville Sausage, and I saw a few new fun flavors at my grocery store, like buffalo and blue cheese! Yum!So what did I think of it? I absolutely loved it! We usually cook sausages on the stove, which gets messy and it’s near impossible to know when they’re done. There was hardly any mess and it cleaned up quite easily. I can’t wait to use the Johnsonville Sizzling Sausage Griller again!We love potato salad with our Brats, and my Red, White & Blue Cheese Potato Salad was a perfect accompaniment. Top those Brats with some creamy Dijon or sauerkraut and you’ve got the perfect summer meal that fit for a King Dad!Want more Johnsonville Sausage recipes?

187,"This One Pan Ham & Cheese Tortellini is super creamy and flavorful, and a delicious was to celebrate National Cheese Day! Everything is cooked together in one pan for a quick, family-friendly weeknight meal with easy clean up.Ham & Cheese go together like peanut butter and jelly. That saltiness of the ham is mellowed my the creaminess of the cheese, and on the flip side, the creaminess of the cheese is cut by the saltiness of the ham. My kids are huge fans of tortellini, so pairing that with ham and cheese for National Cheese Day was kind of a no-brainer.Plus if you’ve been a reader for a while you’ve probably tried some of our other favorite one pan meals, like Italian Sausage & Tortellini and Beef Stroganoff. If you haven’t tried a one pan meal yet, what are you waiting for?! They are a huge time saver in the kitchen, especially on busy weeknights when cooking is the last thing you want to do. No slaving over a hot stove for hours, no heating up the kitchen for an hour with a hot oven. Just 10-15 minutes on the stovetop is all you need for this One Pan Ham & Cheese Tortellini!If you’re not a fan of tortellini, we can’t be friends. Kidding…sort of. But if you’re not, then you could use a dry pasta in this dish in place of the tortellini. The cook time will have to be lengthened a bit, and you might need a bit more liquid, but the method is pretty much the same.When the One Pan Ham & Cheese Tortellini is finished cooking, you’re going to top it with a ton of cheese. Half of that cheese is stirred right in with the ham and pasta to create the sauce. The rest of the cheese is left right on top of the pasta to melt and create that lovely golden crust under the broiler. Now if you’re adverse to turning on the broiler for a few minutes you can just cover the pan with it’s lid or some foil and let the cheese just melt on it’s own. It will take about 5-10 minutes. I recommend the broiler method because the cheese gets ooey gooey and those golden brown mozzeralla bits.

188,"This Lemon Kale Caesar Salad is has a creamy, lemony Parmesan dressing coating crunchy Romaine and everyone’s favorite superfood, kale! Top with some grilled chicken and you’ve got a light and fresh good-for-you summer meal.Caesar salads have always been a favorite of mine. Until recently I’ve only enjoyed this classic salad in restaurants but since it’s a favorite and food is my thing I figured it was time to learn how to make it at home. Homemade salad dressings really are so much better than bottled, store bought dressings and in most cases, this one included, they are incredibly easy to make. Caesar dressing is one of those dressings that people love but choose to be blissfully ignorant about what’s actually in it. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, you might want to shield your eyes from this next sentence. A true, classic Caesar includes raw eggs and anchovies. In case you were wondering, up until now I’ve chosen to be in the blissfully ignorant category. But since I wanted to make it at home I knew I needed to put on my big girls pants and research and test it on my own.My version does include anchovy paste rather than actual chopped up anchovies, because ew. It doesn’t include raw eggs, but I did use mayo so that kind of covers that. There is also sour cream, Parmesan cheese and lots of lemon and lemon zest. Now if you’re not into lemon as much as I am, you can totally cut down on that ingredient or just leave out the lemon zest. Like the title says this is a LEMON Kale Caesar Salad. But feel free to make it your own. Kale can be pretty tough to chew, which is why I usually enjoy it in soups like my Turkey, Kale and Rice Soup. I recently learned a little trick though from A Mind Full Mom that makes a huge difference – massage that kale! In one of her recipes she suggests massaging a vinegar and oil dressing into the kale leaves and allowing them to sit for a while. I decided that I didn’t really want to stick my hands in the creamy Caesar dressing so I just squeezed half of a lemon over the leaves and massaged them like that. Then I added the rest of the ingredients including the dressing about a half an hour before I wanted to eat the salad. It totally worked! This was the most delicious Caesar salad and it was so fresh and tangy.I know that we will be enjoying this salad a lot in the near future! Lemon Kale Caesar Salad for the win!

Store dressing in a sealed container until ready to toss with your salad or for a few days in the fridge.To make the salad, toss kale with 1-2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Massage the lemon juice into the kale leaves. If possible, let sit for at least an hour (Optional - depending on the amount of time you have. This process will just help to soften the raw kale, making it easier to chew).When ready to make the salad, toss the Romaine lettuce and kale together. Drizzle on some of the Caesar dressing and some freshly shredded Parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Add more dressing until you are satisfied with the amount. *Note - only use as much dressing and salad as you plan to eat immediately. Reserve any remaining lettuce and kale separately from the dressing in a zip top bag with a paper towel. For more on how to store lettuce, go HERE.Serve immediately.

189,"Save time on busy weeknights with this shortcut recipe – Marie Callender’s White Cheddar Mac & Cheese is given a delicious upgrade with grilled chicken, roasted tomatoes and asparagus, and fresh grated Parmesan cheese. This Chicken Mac & Cheese with Roasted Tomatoes and Asparagus is super creamy, ultra cheesy and so rich in flavor – it will be your new family favorite weeknight dinner recipe!We are smack in the middle of May and school has just about another month to go. In some states school is over in just a few short days. Life gets so busy this time of year…well, come to think of it, life is busy all year long! But it seems to feel especially crazy as we are nearing the end of the school year.         I’m always on the hunt for recipes that will make my life easier and save me some time in the kitchen without sacrificing taste. So when I was challenged by Kroger to come up with a fresh new recipe from the frozen food aisle, I was excited! Shortcuts are your friend in the kitchen folks, and this recipe is a delicious one.Mac and cheese fans will love Marie Callender’s Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese. It really does taste completely homemade, like you just made it on your own stovetop. It’s one of their “Comfort Bakes” which means traditionally you’d bake it in the oven for about 50 minutes…but that wouldn’t be considered a shortcut now would it? Instead of baking it for nearly an hour, I popped that mac & cheese right into my microwave for about 10 minutes to defrost and heat it up. The cheese is so incredibly rich and creamy, I wouldn’t have had any problem eating the whole pan by myself. But since we’re making this a meal I knew it needed some veggies. While the mac & cheese was heating up, I stuck a pan of grape tomatoes and asparagus in the over to roast for about the same amount time.Then while the veggies were roasting and the mac & cheese was heating, I cooked some chicken in a skillet. If you wanted to keep this a meatless dish, you could eliminate that step. Once everything was cooked I stirred it all together, poured it into a casserole dish and popped it under the broiler to melt the fresh Parmesan I’d grated on top. Again, a totally optional step.         From start to finish, the whole meal took about 20 minutes, which is incredible for something this rich and flavorful. If you’ve never roasted vegetables before, I highly recommend it – especially tomatoes. They develop this sweetness that is just mouthwatering. Paired with the Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, it’s a flavor combination that will leave you begging for more – better make two pans!Be sure to visit the Ralphs website for more Freezer Fresh Ideas and recipes!Like this Chicken Mac & Cheese with Roasted Tomatoes and Asparagus?

The most tender and juicy chicken ever, and so easy and full of flavor!When it comes to baked chicken, I wrote the book.Ok so I didn’t write the book but I did write this recipe that has become the most popular recipe on my site, and has been viewed nearly 3 Million times. It’s no wonder, because it is the best way to cook chicken breasts and get them super tender and moist.This Baked Lemon Chicken recipe puts that recipe to shame in the flavor department. With each bite you get a burst of lemon and herbs that make you want to savor each piece. Plus it’s incredibly tender and juicy, and you can add fresh herbs or dried to give it even more flavor.To make this Baked Lemon Chicken, mix together some dried herbs with corn or canola oil and the juice and zest from a lemon. Pro-tip – make sure to zest the lemon before you juice it! Basting the chicken with the pan juices a couple of times also helps to keep the chicken from drying out.It’s so good, and it’s our new favorite way to make baked chicken!For more easy chicken recipes, try these:Chicken Corn ChowderHoney Lemon Chicken and Green BeansItalian Chicken and Veggies Sheet Pan DinnerHealthy Chicken Fajita BowlsFor all chicken recipes go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Hi!

191,"This Salmon, Asparagus and Potatoes Sheet Pan Dinner will save you valuable time in the kitchen by cooking everything on one baking sheet pan, making it a perfect weeknight meal.When it comes to dinnertime, believe it or not I’m often at a loss for what to cook. I spend so much of my day writing recipes, cooking recipes, photographing recipes and writing about recipes that I just don’t feel like cooking for my family. Ironic, right? I’ve talked to a lot of bloggers and everyone says the same thing – when it’s your job, cooking for fun just doesn’t happen!So sheet pan dinners and one pan meals have really, truly become my go-to for my family. They are simple, easy to prepare, and have great flavor. Like my latest favorite Sheet Pan Salmon, Asparagus and Potatoes. My whole family love salmon so I know I can’t go wrong with that. And even my kids are fans of asparagus. The potatoes can be a hit or miss but these fingerling potatoes that I came across on a recent shopping trip were fun and colorful and they were a super hit!My daughter (the potato hater) gobbled them down and exclaimed that she loved them. That’s a huge win. The color was a little hard for them to get past, but once they did my kids both decided they are fans. I hadn’t realized it, but the purple potatoes were a little sweeter than the rest, and fingerlings are a creamier texture in general. I’m definitely going to be adding this entire meal to our monthly dinner rotation, and I’m planning on creating just a pan of roasted potatoes…we’ll see if that recipe makes the blog so stay tuned!Since the potatoes do take longer to cook, the roasting process starts with just them all by their lonesome. They get all nice and golden brown and start to get soft on the inside. After about 20 minutes they are pushed to the side and the salmon and asparagus are added to the sheet pan. The salmon is brushed with a honey lemon dijon sauce while the potatoes and asparagus just get a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of salt and pepper.After another 15 minutes in the oven, everything is cooked and golden and juicy and flavorful.

192,"This Blue Cheese BLT Sandwich with Lemon Dill Mayo is your favorite, classic sandwich enhanced with sophisticated flavors, making this a sandwich you’ll want to take your time with.What is a BLT? Bacon – Lettuce – Tomato Sandwich. It’s the most basic of sandwiches, and the purists will probably slap me on the wrist for saying this, but it’s boring. I mean, it’s bacon, so it’s got that going for it, but in the realm of sandwiches this classic isn’t anything fancy.Now maybe that’s your thing and I shouldn’t be messing with a good thing but I did. And it was the best sandwich I’d ever had.Before we get into the sandwich, this needs to be said. The key to a good BLT is the bacon. You want good quality bacon, cooked until it’s nice and crispy. No soggy, floppy bacon here. So this is where you spend your money, folks.The key to this Blue Cheese BLT Sandwich is the Lemon Dill Mayo. It’s nothing short of amazing when combined with the other flavors in this sandwich. It’s pretty much just mayonnaise, lemon juice and zest, fresh dill and black pepper. But it amps up the flavor to 11 people. For real.The third component to this sandwich is the blue cheese. I don’t buy anything fancy here, just store brand will suffice. I used a lot of it, in the mayo, on top of the sandwich and on the bread. I just can’t get enough of that tangy, creamy flavor. If you’re not a fan you could leave it out, but it does pair so well with the salty, fatty bacon and the creamy freshness of the lemon dill mayo.This may not be a sandwich you’d make for yourself every day, but why not try something new and different? You just might find that you actually enjoy deviating from the norm.

194,"Mini Ranch Chicken Bean and Cheese Quesadillas are a fun appetizer party food or snack that’s perfect for Cinco di Mayo!Did you know there’s a right and a wrong way to make a quesadilla? The “proper way” is with flour tortillas; I prefer corn. The “proper way” is to fill them with a few tablespoons of cheese. I’ve got beans, cheese AND chicken in these little babies. So apparently although I don’t make quesadillas the “proper” way, I do make them the awesome way, because these Mini Ranch Chicken Bean & Cheese Quesadillas are the best thing I’ve ever tasted.When I was a kid, we always had quesadillas the quick way – American cheese, flour tortilla, microwave. At some point in my youth my grandma or my aunt, I can’t remember who, made me a quesadilla on the stove, fried in butter, and my world was changed forever. These days, my kids actually prefer the microwave method because they are softer. But one day I made my son a corn tortilla quesadilla on the stove, fried in butter, just like grandma used to, and another child’s life was forever changed.Ok, so that might be a little dramatic, but I could munch on these crunchy, cheesy little snacks every day of the year. I like to mix it up once in a while so when we were out of flour tortillas and I was really craving a bean and cheese burrito (total comfort food, am I right?), but all I had were corn tortillas and some of this Slow Cooker Ranch Chicken leftover, I came up with these Mini Ranch Chicken Bean and Cheese Quesadillas. I mixed the beans with the chicken, which was pretty amazing on it’s own, and added a little more Ranch seasoning. So good! I spread some of the bean and chicken mixture on the corn tortilla and folded it over. *Pro tip – be sure to microwave the corn tortillas for about a minute of so to make the pliable – they are much easier to flip when they are folded over versus two tortillas on top of one another.As you can see I’m totally breaking the rules here – Mini tortillas (street taco size like these) are my favorite and I filled them to the brim with the bean mixture, and still added a good sized amount of cheese. What can I say…I like to do things my way! (affiliate link)I fried them in corn oil (why not at least attempt to make it a little healthier, right?) in my cast iron skillet. The result was this crunchy golden outside and a creamy, cheesy and so flavorful filling inside.These Mini Bean and Cheese Quesadillas are great for kids because they’re totally hand-held…which makes them great for parties too. They would also be a great meal in place of basic bean and cheese burritos, served with Mexican Rice on the side and plenty of Ranch for dipping.Want more Mexican food?

It’s Taco Tuesday in a bowl!I have been making this Chicken Taco Salad for years now. It’s the perfect way to use up any leftovers from my Slow Cooker Chicken Tacos, or just for an easy taco style meal when we really just want a refreshing salad.

I actually will usually crushed tortilla chips from the bottom of a bag but was toatlly out when I made this salad! Baking some tortilla slices is an excellent substitution though; just arrange the strips on a baking sheet (no oil needed) and bake in a 350 degree oven until golden. Takes about 5-7 minutes for nice, crunchy tortilla strips.The dressing is probably my favorite part of this Chicken Taco Salad. It’s super simple too – 1 part Ranch dressing, 1 part sour cream and 2 parts of your favorite salsa.

A quick, healthy and light lunch or dinner option any day of the week.Most of the time, my recipes are well thought out, planned in advance, and tested on my family a few times before sharing them here on the blog. Other times I literally walk into the kitchen because I’m starving and need a quick lunch and end up whipping up something so delicious that I have to wait to eat it so I can photograph it and write down the recipe so I won’t forget it.This was one of the latter.I mean, it’s tuna salad right? Not much you can do with tuna salad. Wrong. Oh, so wrong.It was a rainy Tuesday and I walked in the kitchen, distracted by the rumble of thunder in the distance.

I chose the lesser of two evils and set to work, determined to make the best tuna salad I’d ever eaten.This is not the tuna salad of your childhood folks. This is grown up tuna salad right here. Tuna, celery and mayo are married with sour cream, dill, chives, parsley, fresh cracked black pepper and lots of lemon. As if that wasn’t good enough I wrapped it up in some crunchy lettuce leaves.

197,"These Slow Cooker Ranch Chicken Tacos are super delicious and a perfect way to switch up Taco Tuesday. Toss some chicken and a few ingredients in the crockpot and in a few hours you have delicious, tender chicken that is great in all kinds of recipes.Tacos are a go-to for us on busy nights, as they are for many busy families. They are easy to prepare and kids love them. Plus each person can customize their taco with whatever toppings they like. I’m a traditional girl and stick with lettuce, cheese and tomatoes on my tacos, but these Slow Cooker Ranch Chicken Tacos are an exception where I pour on the ranch to add even more great flavor.As with most slow cooker recipes, you could easily make these Ranch Chicken Tacos in your Instant Pot/Pressure Cooker. Just add the ingredients and cook.The best way that I have found to make chicken in the slow cooker is to start with frozen meat. That’s right! Just drop the frozen chicken in and let the slow cooker do it’s thing. Chicken is best cooked at high heat but the slow cooker can sometimes dry out your chicken. Just add the taco and ranch seasonings to the frozen chicken breasts, a little salsa and turn the slow cooker to high – no more dry chicken!Once the chicken is cooked through, shred it up and place it back into the pot for 30 minutes or so. This get those juices enveloping every little pieces and the result is super tender, juicy chicken.We really have developed an affinity for baking our tacos. I’ll include instructions in the recipe below if you choose that method. It’s simple – just fill your crunchy taco shells (we like El Paso Stand and Fill Taco Shells) with meat and cheese, then bake them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. The shells get nice and crunchy and the cheese gooey and melty. Then you’ve got plenty of room on top to add your toppings!   We love this chicken in tacos of course, but it’s also super delicious with Mexican Rice (think Arroz con Pollo) or in burritos and especially in my famous Chicken Taco Salad. I always make a ton of chicken and then we make several different entrees throughout the week. My kids even take it in their school lunches! If they will eat it in front of their friends, it has to be good!For more delicious slow cooker meals, try these:Slow Cooker Mexican BeansSlow Cooker CarnitasSlow Cooker Chicken FajitasSlow Cooker Red Chile BeefSlow Cooker Chicken TacosCheck out all of our delicious Slow Cooker recipes HERE, dinner recipes HERE and the Recipe Index HERE.

All cooked in one pan, this easy weeknight dinner comes together in less than 30 minutes!If after one bite, your kids excitedly exclaim, “Can I take this in my thermos for lunch tomorrow??” you know you’ve got a good one.This Cheesy Beef & Tomato Pasta Skillet was kind of a happy accident. I had intentions of making something for dinner with beef and pasta and cheese. Normally I would have used cheddar or jack cheese but it so happened that I was out of both. So I ended up using Mozzarella and folks, it was so good! The Mozzarella melts much better than the other two cheese I mentioned and it made this dish super creamy.I not only stirred it into the pasta, but sprinkled a bunch on top too. So pretty. If you want those pretty brown bubbles of cheese you could also throw it under the broiler for a few minutes – that would take this dish all the way up to 11 in my opinion.Remember I said my intention was beef, pasta and cheese? I had no intentions of adding tomatoes to this dish. None whatsoever. But I had some sort of out of body experience where I went to the pantry, got a can of tomatoes and added them to the skillet. Guess I’m a creature of habit since I tend to put tomatoes in all sort of skillet dinners, like this Cheesy Smoked Sausage Pasta or this Chicken Apple Sausage Pasta. Whatever the reason I’m glad I added them, because they really did wonders for this skillet dinner.Like all of my One Pot Meals, this Cheesy Beef & Tomato Pasta Skillet is all cooked in one big skillet. There are two methods to get this done. Boil first, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered for about 15-20 minutes. Or, boil, then babysit for about 9 minutes. Sometimes I do both, cover and cook for about 10 minutes while I throw together a salad or grate the cheese, then uncover it and cook it for several minutes over a higher heat. The goal is to cook the pasta and reduce/thicken the sauce. Each of the methods do this equally well, it’s just a matter of personal preference. I’ve found that I like to keep a close eye on it so the pasta doesn’t overcook, so the uncovered, babysitting method is my preference.Whichever cooking method you choose, this Cheesy Beef & Tomato Pasta Skillet won’t let you down.

It’s easy to get them to eat their veggies when they are mixed in to a yummy pasta salad. I added tomatoes (my daughter’s favorite) and peas (my son’s favorite) to this one.For this remake I opted for crispy chicken strips instead of rotisserie chicken, but you could use any kind of pre-cooked chicken you like. The crispy chicken added a delicious element of crunch to this creamy salad.The pasta is cooked separately and cooled, and the bacon is fried until nice and crispy. Everything is tossed together and then coated in the ranch dressing. For the remake I added some mayo and sour cream to the basic Ranch dressing to make it a little creamier. But you could just do the straight Ranch if you prefer.This savory salad has made it into our weekly rotation. We love it for lunch or dinner. It’s will be a hit for your next party, especially Memorial Day and all through the summer!

201,"This Asparagus, Tomato and Goat Cheese Frittata is a healthy addition to your spring brunch table. Full of protein packed eggs and delicious veggies, this Frittata is perfect for breakfast, lunch or even dinner!It’s no secret one of my favorite celebrity chefs is Trisha Yearwood. I’ve loved her for many years, dating back to well before she was known for her cooking. I was recently elated to get to see her perform live with her hubby Garth Brooks (aren’t they the cutest??) and a friend who came along was excited for her to. “When is Trisha coming on?” “Is she going to do a cooking demonstration??” He said these things in jest, but seriously how cool would THAT have been?!It just so happened that Miss Yearwood was going to be autographing copies of her latest cookbook, Trisha’s Table, at a local store the day after the concert. I was so excited, and then I realized that it also happened to be the same day and time as my son’s 9th birthday party. Way to burst my balloon!Anyway, even though I didn’t get to meet her that day, I still watch her show religiously. My kids love her too, and anytime they hear her on the radio they get very excited. This recipe is one that I adapted from something she made not too long ago on her show.Frittatas are a great way to use up leftovers in your fridge because you can put just about anything in a frittata – meats, veggies, cheeses. Miss Yearwood made an Asparagus & Feta Frittata and this is my spin on it.I added tomatoes and swapped the Feta out for some of my favorite goat cheese. It was beyond amazing! So creamy and tender and fluffy and flavorful. That’s a lot of adjectives but they’re all true! This Asparagus, Tomato and Goat Cheese Frittata would be wonderful for Easter or Mother’s Day brunch or when you’re feeling a little crazy and want breakfast for dinner. This little one pan wonder will impress even the toughest critics.

Cook until softened; about 3-4 minutes. Add asparagus and cook until just softened; about 2 minutes.Meanwhile, in a medium sized bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, heavy cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the crumbled goat cheese, reserving a handful for the top, then slowly pour the egg mixture and vegetables and cook until almost set (still loose in the center but the edges start to pull away from the pan); about 4-6 minutes.Slide the pan into the oven and bake at 350 degrees F until set; about 14-16 minutes. *To brown the top, switch to the broiler for a few minutes (optional)."
202,"This Lemon Herb Chicken & Asparagus Sheet Pan Dinner will be your new go-to for those busy weeknights when you just want to get dinner on the table in a hurry. It’s a delicious and healthy one pan meal that’s quick to prepare, cook and clean-up!If there’s one thing a busy parent needs in their arsenal it’s the one pan meal. They are quick and easy, and often a full course meal in just one pan. They don’t require a ton of babysitting and they come together pretty quickly. The Sheet Pan Dinner is the new one pan! All you need is a rimmed baking sheet like these.You can line the pan with parchment paper or foil if you like for even easier clean-up, but I usually skip that step. Because I use olive oil on the chicken and veggies the sticking is minimal, if at all.You don’t need a ton ingredients to make this Lemon Herb Chicken & Asparagus Sheet Pan Dinner, I’m guessing you already have most of them on hand. Chicken, asparagus (the super thin pencil kind), olive oil, lemon and Italian seasoning. This has become my go-to seasoning combo for chicken – I love it!I marinated the chicken in the olive oil, lemon juice and seasonings for about half an hour, but you could skip that step in a hurry. The chicken takes longer to cook than the asparagus so that goes in first for about 15 minutes, then the asparagus is added to the sheet pan and drizzled with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and pinch of salt. Bake for an additional 12 minutes. Keep in mind that I do cut my chicken into smaller pieces and I do pound the thicker pieces out. If you don’t do that, you may end up with some pieces that are over-cooked and some that are under.I knew after the way my family scarfed this meal down that it was going to be a new favorite I’d be making over and over again. I am already thinking about the next time!For more easy weeknight meals, try these:Italian Chicken & Veggies Sheet Pan DinnerShredded Chicken Parmesan SandwichHamburger SoupSloppy Joe Tater Tot Pie For all main dish recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Hi!

Arrange chicken in the center of a large sheet pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Bake for 15 minutes.Take pan out of the oven. Slide chicken to one side of the sheet pan and arrange asparagus on the other side. Drizzle asparagus with olive oil (about a tablespoon or so) and squeeze juice from half a lemon over the asparagus. Sprinkle with salt, then using tongs or your hands, toss gently to coat.Bake for another 10-12 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and asparagus is crisp-tender (soft, but still has a bite to it). Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Let chicken rest, covered, for 5 minutes before serving."
203,"These Baked Salmon and Asparagus Foil Packets are so easy to throw together for busy weeknights! They have minimal clean up too which can’t be beat.Hi all! Sam from The Culinary Compass back to bring you another great weeknight dish.What I love about foil packet dinners, is they are perfectly portioned out for you and there’s little you have to do once they are in the oven baking. This one might be my new favorite just from all the flavors and how delicious it turns out!I love the brightness of the lemon and dill together especially with the salmon. If you’re a big dill fan, take some off of the sprigs and mix it around with the salt and pepper so you get it directly on the salmon rather than just having it sit on top.The lemon definitely should be squeezed over the salmon and placed on top to steam with the rest of the veggies.These are perfect, light flavors for summer. If you like a little heat with your dishes, I recommend adding some red pepper flakes! It’ll give it a kick to break up the acidity of the lemon.I used olive oil, but you could always use butter too! You’ll probably need to spray the bottom of the foil with non-stick spray and place a big pad of butter in the packet.You can always add more veggies to your packet if you’re looking for more flavors too! Try peppers or squash if you’re looking for a change.I serve the packets with some rice, but quinoa or couscous could be a great alternative. You could also just serve it over a salad with a little extra lemon juice for a dressing!If you’re looking for other great weeknight meals, check out this Easy Seafood Pasta with White Wine Sauce or this One Pan Herbed Tilapia and Squash.For more easy meal ideas, try these:Teriyaki Salmon Lettuce WrapsOne Pan Tomato Basil Chicken LinguineItalian Chicken and Veggies Sheet Pan DinnerFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Sam is the blogger behind The Culinary Compass where she loves to try new dishes and ingredients from around the world.

Place about 1/4 of the asparagus (about 6-7 stems) and 1/4 of the onion slices on each piece of foil. Place a salmon fillet on each pile.Drizzle 1 tbsp of olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper on each. Move the salmon and asparagus around to make sure it's evenly coated.Squeeze about 3 slices of lemon on top of each salmon and lay them on top. Place a sprig of dill on each.Bring the long sides of the foil up to the middle and fold the edges together. Roll up each of the sides and place them on a cookie sheet. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until salmon is flaky.Serve with rice and enjoy!"
204,"Asparagus Shakshuka is a delicious and easy dish of eggs poached in a sauce of stewed tomatoes and asparagus topped with scallions and thyme. Fresh, light and perfect for dinner, and ready in 30 minutes! When my husband and started dating was when I really started cooking a lot. I’ve always loved food, watching cooking shows and learning techniques, but when I lived alone I really didn’t have any desire to make big meals all the time. Then he came along with a large, adventurous appetite and I started making him all the dishes I had been wanting to cook.Even though I made him a ton of different dinners from different types of cuisines that first couple of years, for some reason I always remember the first time I made him Shakshuka. It’s such an easy recipe to make and takes so little effort that I was surprised it was such a hit. He absolutely loved it.The thing about Asparagus Shakshuka is that it’s a little dish with big, big flavor. The sauce cooks down to a soft and silky texture while the asparagus hold a little bit of crunchy bite to them, and there is something about a runny yolk that just feels decadent. Bright flavors of fresh thyme and scallions come through at the end, tying it all together. It’s seriously good.There are a thousand ways to make Shakshuka, and they are all fabulous, but this version just feels so happy to me. Asparagus Shakshuka feels like spring and comfort all together in one dish. Just give it a try, and I know you’ll feel the same!For More One Pan Dinners, Try These:One Pan Hummus Chicken with Veggies + FetaOne Pan Roasted Vegetables + Chicken SausageOne Skillet Cod Veracruz","Dice the shallot. Trim the ends of the asparagus and cut it into bite sized pieces. Set the tips aside.In a large pan heated over medium heat, saute the shallot and asparagus pieces for about 5 minutes.Add the can of tomatoes, broth, salt, pepper, garlic and thyme. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce is thick.Using a spoon, make a well in the sauce and then crack an egg into it. Repeat with each egg. Sprinkle the top with the reserves asparagus tips, scallions and some extra thyme leaves. Cover the pan and let it cook for 10-12 minutes. Ten minutes will yield very soft and runny yolks, 12 minutes will yield soft but slightly firm yolks.When done, season the top with salt and pepper. Serve with some good, crusty bread."

206,"This Creamy Taco Pasta Salad is the perfect way to usher in picnic season. A Creamy Taco Dressing tops tender pasta, flavorful ground beef and all of your favorite taco toppings to create a crave-worthy pasta salad that everyone will love.Pasta Salads are one of my favorite things to make in spring and summer. Once the days start to warm, and the evenings too, we are always looking for ways to keep cool, and that includes in the kitchen! Cold salads are a great way to feed your family a complete meal without turning on your oven.My family loves pasta salads, especially this Creamy Taco Pasta Salad. This salad is a fun way to shake up your usual taco night, and it’s a great dish to being to picnics, potlucks or barbecues. There isn’t a ton of prep-work and the whole pasta salad comes together in about 20 minutes.          The creamy taco dressing is a combination of spices, sour cream, salsa and a little mayo for creaminess. The mayo also isn’t absorbed by the pasta like the sour cream can be, so it helps this pasta salad stay nice and creamy. If you don’t want to mix up all of the spices, a tablespoon of packaged taco seasoning mixed with the sour cream would work just as well.I like to enjoy this salad at room temp, right after it’s all mixed together, but you can also store it in the fridge for a day or two until you’re ready to serve it. Just be sure to save the diced avocado and tortilla chips and add them right before serving so they’ll stay fresh.

207,"One Pan Tomato Basil Chicken Linguine is the easiest one pan meal I’ve ever made. Everything is cooked in one pan and it creates it’s own sauce as it cooks. This meal is ready in under 20 minutes making it perfect for those busy weeknights.If I had to choose one food that I had to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be pasta. Pasta with cheese, pasta in broth, pasta by itself…I could manage and manage beautifully. Pasta is my friend, my soulmate and it’s never let me down.Okay I might be getting a little carried away, but the point is – I LOVE PASTA. I also love One Pan Meals. They are so easy to prepare and leave me with only one pan to clean. Anything that saves me time in the kitchen is high on my list of favorites! I’ve done a lot of one pan meals over the years, some of the most popular being One Pan Cheesy Smoked Sausage and Pasta Skillet, One Pan Spicy Lemon Chicken Pasta with tomatoes and most recently, One Pan Lemon Chicken Picatta Pasta.A lot of the meals require browning and covered cooking, but I’ve found that it isn’t always necessary, and the one pan pasta can actually cook quicker with the lid off. Like this One Pan Tomato Basil Chicken Linguine; I decided not to brown the chicken since the browning step can sometimes lead to over-cooked/dry chicken and I stood at the stove while it cooked, turning and stirring the pasta. Smaller noodles wouldn’t require the same amount of babysitting, but the linguine would be a giant sticky mess if left unattended. Plus it only takes 9 minutes with this method, as opposed to 20-25 minutes with the covered pan. That’s some nice time-saving!The chicken is bite-sized so it cooks fairly quickly, and the water is absorbed into the pasta as it cooks. The remaining water combines with the tomatoes and creates a luscious sauce that is heightened in flavor at the end with the added Parmesan Cheese. This One Pan Tomato Basil Chicken Linguine has quickly become a favorite. Sometimes I’ll halve the recipe and make it for lunch (I can get two lunches out of it that way). It’s a nice departure from the boring sandwiches I’ll often have! My family loves it too, which is why it’s become a regular in our meal rotation. I hope your family enjoys it as much as ours!Italian Chicken & Veggies Sheet Pan DinnerLemon Chicken & Broccoli SkilletOne Pan Lemon, Ricotta & Kale PastaOne Pot Beef StroganoffFor all One Pan Meals go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Hi!

208,"Make tonight a Manwich Night with this delicious weeknight dinner favorite – Sloppy Joe Tater Tot Pie. With tons of fresh veggies, ground beef and that famous Manwich Sloppy Joe Sauce – it’s sure to be a hit with your family, too! This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Manwich. All opinions are 100% mine.I’ve shared several Sloppy Joe recipes on the blog but I think I have a new favorite with this Sloppy Joe Tater Tot Pie. It’s got all the delicious sweet and tangy flavors I remember about Sloppy Joe night as a kid, in an updated one-skillet version with a crunchy tater tot crust.Do you remember eating sloppy joes as a kid? I remember always being super excited about Sloppy Joe night – those sandwiches were always so fun to eat! My kids love the sweet and tangy taste of Manwich too, and I love how versatile the sauce is. I can make anything from Pizza to pasta to this Skillet Sloppy Joe Tater Tot Pie. It’s quite similar to a Shepherd’s Pie, with lots of meat and veggies in a rich and flavorful sauce and topped with potatoes – I just happened to opt for the tater tot variety instead of the mashed kind that take another hour to make. It’s all about the time savers friends!The best part of this recipe is that it all cooks in one skillet, making for super easy clean-up. First cook up the ground beef and vegetables. Drain any grease from the pan, then add the Manwich sauce, pinto beans and corn. Let it all simmer together for a few minutes to thicken, then top it off with frozen tater tots. Bake for about 30 minutes, and dinner is done! Super easy to make, super easy to serve (just take the skillet right to the table!) and super easy to clean up. Plus there are a bunch of fresh veggies so you know you’re serving your family a complete meal.(Sidenote – if you are short on time, a bag of frozen mixed veggies works great too – add them when you add the sauce).Manwich is available in three varieties, Manwich Original, Manwich Bold and Manwich Thick & Chunky. You can find recipes and more at Manwich.com, and be sure to follow @Manwich on Twitter for even more great ideas.

Drain grease from the pan (I just push the meat and veggies to the side and use paper towels to soak up the grease).Stir in frozen corn, pinto beans and Manwich Bold Sloppy Joe Sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes, until mixture is slightly thickened. Spread evenly around the pan. Arrange frozen tater tots on top of the beef mixture. Sprinkle with sharp cheddar cheese.Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until tots are crispy and cheese is melted.Cool for several minutes and garnish with fresh chopped parsley (if desired) before serving."
209,"This Lemon Herb Pork Tenderloin is tender and flavorful with lots of fresh herbs and lemons. It’s surprisingly easy and cooks in under 30 minutes (plus marinade time), making it a great weeknight meal.Pork Tenderloin is super tender cut of pork that easily lends itself to tons of different flavor options. It is similar to chicken breast, but (in my opinion) more rich in flavor. If you cook it right, pork tenderloin can be the most tender, juicy meat you’ve ever eaten.I have cooked tenderloins a variety of ways, from the slow cooker to the grill, but my favorite method is the cast iron skillet. The meat is seasoned or marinated and seared in the cast iron before finishing it in the oven. The pork should register between 145 and 160 degrees on a meat thermometer, and it must have time to rest before slicing. Like any meat, the juices come to the center as the meat cooks and need time to redistribute. If you cut into it right away, all those yummy, lovely juices spill all over your cutting board and the result is a dry piece of meat instead of a tender, juicy one.This particular recipe is a favorite, because I just love the combination of fresh lemons and herbs. We used to have a lemon tree in our backyard and I would cook with lemons all the time – I miss that tree! Anyway, the pork tenderloin is marinated in lemon juice and olive oil with some fresh herbs and a little dijon mustard for some extra punch. Give it at least 30 minutes in the marinade, but the longer, the better.Then the pork is seared in a skillet (if you don’t have cast iron, thats ok, but the skillet needs to be oven safe). Finally slide that baby into the oven and let it cook for about 18 minutes. Pull it out and tent it with foil, and let it rest for at least 5-10 minutes before slicing. The resting is so important, so don’t skip it!I hope your family enjoys this meal as much as mine does!Love pork?

210,"This Balsamic Strawberry Pasta Salad is a whole meal in itself, with tender chicken and pasta, sweet strawberries, and a tangy Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette.At any time in my life, if you asked me what my favorite fruit was, it would be strawberries. To this day they are my “clean eating” of choice. However if you’d asked me if I like strawberries with balsamic vinegar I would have looked at you like you were nuts. Strawberries and vinegar?? What kind of alternate universe is that??As it turns out, that combination is an amazing one! Like, slap your grandma amazing. The sweet and tart go together like peanut butter and jelly – it’s a perfect flavor combination.And it’s perfect in this pasta salad as well! I threw a lot of other goodies in there to help amp up this salad, like chicken (Rotisserie chicken is perfect for this), spinach, pasta, basil and my favorite Feta cheese. Add a few walnuts for crunch and this is one delicious meal!Everyone knows the secret to a really good pasta salad is the dressing. Pasta salad dressings are usually one of two things – creamy (think mayo, sour cream, etc.) or the oil and vinegar type. This Balsamic Strawberry Pasta Salad falls under the latter. The dressing super simple, with just strawberries, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and a touch of honey for sweetness.It’s perfectly fresh and light and perfect for welcoming spring in a few weeks. I can definitely see us making this Balsamic Strawberry Pasta Salad over and over again for lunch, for dinner or even breakfast! It’s hearty, it’s healthy and it tastes amazing.

211,"This Italian Chicken and Vegetables Sheet Pan Dinner is the ultimate one pan meal. It’s super flavorful and is so easy to prepare. It’s a healthy meal the whole family will love!I’ll admit, I’m not usually the first to jump on any food bandwagon. Some trends are merely fads that just don’t last. But when it comes to one pan meals, they are definitely here to stay, and this sheet pan dinner is kind of an updated, healthier version of those, which usually contain a ton of cheese or cream. Sheet pan dinners are baked in the oven, and like the name says all of the ingredients are laid out on a single sheet pan.I mentioned above that I’m not really much into food trends. These sheet pan dinners have been around for a while, but I’ve just recently started working with those recipes. This is the first one I made, and oh my goodness, my family went nuts for it! No pasta, no rice, no bread, just chicken and veggies with a little olive oil and seasoning. My kids gobbled it down and my son went for seconds on…get this…broccoli!This Italian Chicken and Vegetables Sheet Pan Dinner is not only healthy, it’s super delicious. The vegetables can be swapped out for things like sweet potatoes, squash, green beans, cauliflower or asparagus. Starchier vegetables like potatoes will take longer to cook so you might want to put them in by themselves for 10-15 minutes to get them started before adding any other veggies and the chicken.I like to go an extra step and brown the chicken before baking. That means using another pan but it doesn’t really add any time to the cooking process. The browning step just adds a little more depth of flavor and color to the chicken. It’s not a necessary step, just a personal preference. While you’re browning, you’ll just put the veggies into the oven to start cooking. After cooking the chicken in the skillet for about 5 minutes, you’ll add it to the sheet pan. If you don’t want to dirty another pan, just put the chicken totally raw on the pan with the veggies. They will all cook in the same amount of time. Either way, super easy! I have added instructions for both methods in the recipe below.I’m working on a few other sheet pan dinners, but in the meantime I thought I’d share a few from my friends that you might also love.

212,"This Broccoli Tortellini Alfredo is rich and creamy and comes together in less than 15 minutes! It’s a great lunch or dinner for when you need to get a complete meal on the table in a hurry.Broccoli Tortellini Alfredo is one of my favorite go-to meals. My kids love it and I love that it is incredibly easy to make. It literally takes just minutes from start to finish and dinner is on the table. It’s a complete meal in itself with all the cheesy goodness of the tortellini and you get a good shot of veggies from the broccoli.If you’ve never made Alfredo Sauce, it can seem intimidating. But the reality is it is truly one of the easiest sauces to make. It’s all about timing. There are only 4 ingredients – butter, heavy cream, garlic and Parmesan cheese. The butter is melted slowly over a medium-low heat, then the garlic is stirred in the cook and add flavor. Careful to only cook the garlic for 30 seconds or so before adding the cream – the garlic can burn fast and it will ruin the whole sauce. The cream is whisked in with the butter until it’s combined and starts to gently simmer. No boiling here – you’ll be adding the cheese soon and if it’s too hot the sauce will break (divide the fat and protein) and that’s not tasty. Finally remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the Parmesan Cheese until it’s completely melted.While the sauce is cooking, you’ll want to boil a large pot of salted water. I buy my Tortellini in the big 20 ounce packs from Costco, but you can use two of the 9-ounce packages from the grocery store too. You’ll want to follow the package instructions to see how long to cook the tortellini, but the Costco one only takes 2 minutes so I add the tortellini and broccoli at the same time. The broccoli only need about 2 minutes, so manage that time accordingly.Finally, add the tortellini and broccoli to the Alfredo sauce. It will thicken a little as it sits with the added starch from the pasta. This recipe makes just enough to coat the tortellini and broccoli, but you could make a little more sauce if you want it on the saucier side.My family just gobbles this Broccoli Tortellini Alfredo up, and they always ask for seconds. It can easily be a complete meal, or you could add some chicken or shrimp for something a little heartier. I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine does!Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add tortellini and cook to package instructions. Add the broccoli during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking time. Drain and set aside.In a large pan or skillet over medium-low heat melt the butter. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the milk/heavy cream. Bring to a simmer (small bubbles are starting to form around the edges - do not boil), then turn off heat and add in the Parmesan cheese, stirring until melted. Taste and add salt and pepper as desired.Add the tortellini and broccoli to the sauce and toss to coat. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley and additional shredded Parmesan, if desired. Serve immediately."
213,"Traditional Polish Latkes are given a healthy makeover into these Vegan Potato Pancakes – perfect for Valentine’s Day breakfast with the one you love.My mother’s side of the family is Polish and while we didn’t get a ton of Polish culture when we were young, we did get a lot of the classic Polish food like Stuffed Cabbage Rolls, Pierogies (basically big raviolis), and Latkes. You probably know Latkes by the name of Potato Pancakes. So, I decided to take the classic Latke and give it a little makeover into these Vegan Potato Pancakes made with red potatoes.Full disclosure – I definitely did not go into the kitchen intending to make these vegan. I thought I had one last egg left for this recipe, but when I remembered that I had used it to make breakfast for my daughter, I was immediately glad to be given the push I needed to turn these into a healthier Vegan Potato Pancake. There was a bag of chia seeds hanging out in a cabinet, so I used those to make an egg replacement, and it worked out beautifully!Even if you aren’t vegan, you should definitely add chia seeds to your diet. They may be tiny, but they are among the most nutritious foods on the planet, laden with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein, and they are almost always grown organically.Instead of the traditional big brown guy used for most potato recipes, I chose to use red potatoes. And since most of the nutrition is found in the thin red skin, I left the skins on. Red potatoes are a great source of fiber, vitamin B, iron and potassium. So, while you are pretty much eating a bunch of potatoes as a meal, with these Vegan Potato Pancakes you are basically eating the healthiest potato meal of your life. You’re welcome.Look how brown and crispy they are. The inside, in contrast, was perfectly soft and creamy. Just the way you want a potato pancake to be.The recipe is perfect for two, so give these Vegan Potato Pancakes a try with your honey and then let me know what you think!For more yummy recipes, try these:Mom’s Stuffed Cabbage Rolls Vegan Caesar Salad Dressing Chia Seed Pudding with Mango PureeAnd for more potato recipes, try these:Cheesy Scalloped PotatoesTwice Baked Sweet PotatoesOven Roasted Parmesan Potatoes For all side dishes go HERE, for the Recipe Index go HERE.","Grind the chia seeds into a meal using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder. Add the water, stir together and then set aside to thicken.Wash the potatoes well and dry them on a clean towel.Into a bowl, grate the potatoes with the skins on using a cheese grater.Into the same bowl, grate the onion.Take a clean kitchen towel and pile the grated potatoes and onion onto the center. Gather the towel around the potato and onion and, over the sink, squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can. Return the potato and onion to the bowl.Add the salt, pepper, garlic powder and chia seeds to the mixture in the bowl and mix to combine it well.Add the flour to the bowl and mix again.In a large pan, heat about a tablespoon of coconut oil over medium heat. When the pan is hot, drop large spoonfuls of the potato mixture onto the pan and spread it out a little using the spoon so that it is round and flat. I cooked 3 at a time.Cook the pancakes on each side for 5-6 minutes, until they are very brown. You can push down on them every so often with a spatula to make sure they are crisping up.Serve with sour cream or apple sauce."
214,"This Creamy Chicken Cobb Pasta Salad has all the flavors of the classic Cobb Salad, like hard boiled eggs, avocado and blue cheese, in a delicious cold pasta salad. Perfect for spring and summer picnics!If you’ve never had a Cobb Salad, you really don’t know what you’re missing. My dad wasn’t a fan of the “meal salad” too much but he absolutely loved this one. Could have been all the salty bacon and tangy blue cheese, because that’s my favorite part too!There are lots of different variations of this salad out there, but the original was actually the result of a 1930’s restaurant owner’s late night hunger pillage through his restaurant’s kitchen. It consisted of three different kinds of lettuces, chicken, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, chives, bacon, cheese and some French dressing. You don’t usually see Cobb Salad served with French dressing in restaurants anymore, but certainly the other ingredients have been the mainstays of the recipe.When I order this salad it’s usually with a vinaigrette type of dressing. But for this pasta salad version I wanted something light but creamy. I combined Bob’s Lite Blue Cheese Dressing with sour cream, mayonnaise and some Dijon mustard. The salad itself is made up of small pasta (like Rotini, macaroni, bowtie, etc.) and is full of all kinds of Cobb-y goodness, like chicken, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, green onions, hard boiled eggs and avocado. (Want to know how to make perfect hard boiled eggs every time? Check out THIS POST).Seasoned with just a little salt and pepper (careful with the salt – the bacon and blue cheese are pretty salty on their own), this Creamy Cobb Pasta Salad is a guaranteed winner every time!Love pasta salads?

215,"Easily make this Mediterranean Panini with the flavors of sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, pesto, and more! No panini press needed!If you’ve ever had a panini sandwich, you know how amazing they are. The lovely crunchy outside with the warm, gooey inside. What would just be a regular sandwich on any other day turns into something amazing when you brush it with olive oil and press it.There are panini presses you can buy, but you can also get this George Foreman 4 Serving Removable Plate Grill and Panini Press. I just use a counter top indoor grill like that to make my paninis. They make those lovely golden stripes and heat the sandwiches to perfection. But if you don’t have a grill, you can use two frying pans. (You will use one of the pans to press the sandwiches down while they cook in the other frying pan).The flavors of this panini come from Greece and Italy. Pesto, spinach, artichokes, mozzarella or provolone cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes are the special ingredients that bring this sandwich to life.Here’s how you make it:Get two slices of sourdough or French bread. Brush the bottom of each slice with olive oil. Turn over and spread pesto on both slices and top the bottom slice with cheese. I like to put the cheese right on top of the bread so that as it melts, it holds the whole sandwich together. Add a generous layer of chicken lunch meat (or a thick slice of chicken breast). Then top with spinach, sliced or diced artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and more cheese. Place the other slice of bread on top.Now you are ready to grill and press it. Gently place the sandwich onto your grill. I push the top slice a little off the sandwich toward the back of the grill. I do this because as you close the lid of the grill, it pushes the top slice forward.Next, fold a towel or cloth and put it over the top of the grill. Press down firmly on the lid and hold it for 30 seconds to a minute. The towel will catch the steam and keep you from getting burned.Once the sandwich has been sufficiently flattened, you can stop putting pressure on the lid and just let it continue to cook until it is golden brown.Slide out of the grill, slice, and eat! This pairs well with some Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Soup and some Coconut Pistachio Ice Cream for dessert!Add these wonderful complementary dishes to your meal!Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Soup      Pistachio Coconut Ice Cream      For more delicious sandwich ideas, try these:Shredded Chicken Parmesan SandwichEasy Chicken Club Lettuce WrapsCrispy Dill Chicken SandwichFor all sandwiches go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.Melissa loves inventing new ice cream flavors and helping people declutter and organize their homes.

(Alternately, you can place each sandwich in a heated frying pan).Press the lid down on the grill or press, and hold down firmly for 30 seconds to a minute. Be sure to use a towel over the lid to protect yourself from any escaping steam. If using a frying pan, press the sandwiches with a smaller pan on top.Grill until golden. Then remove, slice, and serve immediately."
216,"This Easy Ground Beef & Noodle Stir Fry is the perfect 20 minute weeknight meal! It’s quick, it’s tasty and it’s a good way to use up leftover veggies and meats and customize it to your personal taste.Stir fry is something we do a lot of in our house. It’s an excellent way to use up veggies and meats that we have leftover. Often times we’ll make fried rice because we always seem to have rice leftover, but this time I decided a noodle stir fry was in order as a way to use up some leftover broccoli and carrots.Chicken or pork would also be delicious with this meal, and a variety of veggies, like bell peppers or zucchini; anything that lends itself to that delicious Asian flavor profile.This Easy Asian Style Beef & Noodle Stir Fry really couldn’t be easier to make. The beef and onions are cooked together while the pasta boils. I used the thinner angel hair pasta since it works best in this kind of meal. You could swap out rice noodles, udon noodles or even spaghetti if you prefer. Once the meat is cooked, add the veggies and cook them for a few minutes to soften. You still want them to have a bit of crunch.          Finally a sweet, Asian style sauce of soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar and ginger is poured over the beef and noodles in the pan and everything is tossed together to coat. That’s it! Just about 20 minutes is all it takes and dinner is on the table.adapted from Damn Delicious.

Season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking up the beef into small pieces as you go, until meat is fully cooked and no longer pink; about 6-8 minutes. Drain grease from the pan. (I use paper towels for this step to just soak up the grease. It's ok to leave some behind for flavor).Stir in the carrots, snap peas and broccoli and cook until soft, about 2-3 minutes.Stir in the noodles and sauce mixture and toss to coat and heat through; about 2-3 minutes.Serve immediately, garnished with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds, if desired."

My kids seem to be more busy than I am. With school back in full swing now after the holiday break we are literally short for time almost any given night.I have 2 boys in traveling basketball this year, which I might add they aren’t on the same team since they like to split it up by grades. So that means 2 separate practice days, times and tournament schedules. Oh and these tournaments happen each weekend so our Saturdays and Sundays are entirely taken up and consumed by sports.But it’s all fun and once summer comes, we will have 3 in baseball on different teams. It’s just the life of a mom who has kids in sports! Of course, with that life comes dinners that have to be quick and easy. Thankfully that is something I’ve learned to do quite well over the years.This Taco Stuffed Bread is equally quick as it is tasty! If you’re a fan of the tacos and want to switch it up then this is a delicious alternative! A loaf of french bread is gutted and stuffed with seasoned ground beef and cheese and baked until bubbly. It’s then topped with our essential and favorite toppings to finish it off.I’m lucky enough my boys have grown out of their “picky” phase and enjoy the tomatoes, onions and olives that I always put on this Taco Stuffed Bread! We make this so much that my kids have deemed it the one dinner that they get to cook, which is fine by this mama because I’m all about teaching my kids in the kitchen.So if you’re short on time but want a good quality, filling dinner then this Taco Stuffed Bread will not disappoint.

218,"This Easy Goulash with Corn & Kidney Beans is so simple and delicious, it will become a go-to on your weekly menu. It satisfies even the pickiest tastes.Hello! This is my first contributing post on Yellow Bliss Road, and I’m so excited to be sharing one of my recipes with you guys every month. The team Kristin has compiled is so talented, I’m honored to be a part of it, and I look forward to seeing what everyone else has to bring, as well.I had never heard of goulash before a little over a year ago. My father-in-law, when asked what his favorite meal is, said it was goulash, so I started doing a little research on what that is. Turns out, it’s a very simple pasta recipe that has many variations. His favorite includes corn and kidney beans, so I came up with my own version around the one his mom use to make him when he was younger.This Easy Goulash really reminds me of bolognese, which is one of my favorite things in the whole world. My daughter loves meatballs, so we call this “pasta with meatball sauce” when speaking to her about what we’re having for dinner.Really, this dish is what you’d call an American Goulash. Hungarian Goulash is a whole different thing, although tasty in it’s own right. The Hungarian kind is more of a soup or stew and it uses other spices such as paprika.In this Easy Goulash with Corn & Kidney Beans, I use only garlic, bay leaves and salt and pepper as seasonings. So, it’s incredibly simple to throw together on a busy weeknight when you are in need of an easy dinner idea. You could even use granulated garlic instead of fresh garlic, which would do away with some of the chopping and make it even easier. If you do that, I would use 1/2 tsp of granulated garlic in place of the fresh garlic. Either way, you’ll have a family favorite on your hands!For more easy dinner ideas, try these:Easy Weeknight Pasta with Meat SauceHamburger SoupChicken & Black Bean Baked TacosSheet Pan Roasted Veggies & Chicken SausageSlow Cooker Mongolian Beef For more Easy Weeknight Meals go HERE , for all Dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Save","Put your pot of water for the pasta on to boil.In a large skillet, heat the olive oil.

Place a lid on the skillet and let it simmer while your pasta is cooking. You can let it simmer for as long as you want, as the flavors will continue to develop the longer it cooks. Stir occasionally to keep the bottom from burning.When the water is boiling, salt it with 1 tablespoon of salt and then add your pasta.

220,"These Teriyaki Chicken Lettuce Wraps are a fun and delicious way to enjoy your favorite teriyaki chicken. Perfect for a light lunch or dinner, they are a whole meal wrapped up in a crunchy lettuce wrap.One of my favorite places to eat out is a little chain restaurant Islands. I think it might be only local to Southern California, but it’s this kind of Cali-Hawaii style joint with lots of good Aloha type food. My favorite meal there is the Yaki Tacos – Grilled chicken and pineapple, lettuce, tomato, jack cheese all topped off with a sweet Teriyaki sauce. They are a little on the indulgent side of course, so I love to make the same kind of thing at home, but take out the tortilla to make it a little bit better for me.Lettuce Wraps have always kind of been my jam. They add that crunch that you really want from a taco, but without all the fat and calories of a deep fried tortilla, or even a soft one. I’ve experimented with different things to fill them with, like Chicken Club and Chicken Apple Salad. We love to make regular tacos this way too – even my kids enjoy them! They love that they are a little messy and they don’t miss the tortilla one bit.These Chicken Teriyaki Lettuce Wraps are super easy and make for a great, light meal. You can make your own Teriyaki Sauce like I do in the recipe below, or use one that you already love (or even use just bottled!). Topped with green onions, shredded jack cheese and a nice, grilled pineapple (I just caramelize them in a cast-iron skillet), these are my favorite lettuce wraps yet!For more delicious meal ideas, try these:Teriyaki Chicken SaladBaked Salmon Teriyaki Lettuce WrapsChicken & Asparagus Stir-FryCitrus Grilled ChickenFor all salads go HERE, for all main dishes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

221,"Hi! I am Kristen from A Mind “Full” Mom. Through my family’s journey with Cystic Fibrosis, I have learned the importance of healthy eating and it has become my passion. I may or may not be obsessed with chocolate, but you can guarantee that I will be sharing with you my tips, tricks and recipes on how to eat wholesome food without losing your mind or budget. Check A Mind “Full” Mom on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter.No matter what I seem to do, day in and day out, dinner needs to be made. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.I love to eat and even love to cook, but sometimes the meal planning that goes behind it can stress me out. Especially when faced with a busy week. Go ahead, admit it, you are right there with me. I don’t know about you, but for me, the less cooking and grocery shopping I have to do for a busy week, the better.Thankfully for you, I have done the leg work for and created an easy to follow meal plan that is inexpensive, easy, and guaranteed to feed your family meals they will beg for again and again.We start with Homemade Rotisserie Chicken.Do NOT be daunted by this, it is literally a hands off approach to have a clean version of your favorite grocery store short-cut. Trust me, it is SO worth making your own rotisserie chicken. It is cheaper and tastier, not to mention free of all kinds of preservatives and excess sodium. (*editor’s note – you can definitely use grocery store or Coscto Rotisserie chickens if you prefer).Once we have our Homemade Rotisserie Chicken, we will make Homemade Chicken Stock from our scraps and you are ready to make easy, delicious meals all week long.Let me break this down for you in EASY, MANEAGEABLE steps.Step One: Season Three Whole Chickens and pop into the oven at 300 degrees.Step Two: Peel 1 pound carrots, 3 large onions, and 1 head of garlic, saving the peels. Chop the vegetables into 1 inch chunks and add to 3 pounds red potatoes, cut into 1 inch chunks as well. Toss the vegetable mixture with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper and pop into the oven with the chicken. The vegetables will be fine to roast for the full time as the chicken, since the oven is set at a low temperature.Step Three: Serve your family a lovely Roast Chicken with vegetables with dinner.Step Four: While you enlist someone else to do the dishes (don’t you like the way I think), you can remove the meat from the chickens and place the carcasses into a large stock pan or your slow cooker and add in those peels from your roasted your vegetables. Cover with water, season with salt and pepper and a couple bay leaves, and either simmer for 3-4 hours, or cook in your slow cooker for 8-10 hours (or even overnight.) Once done cooking, strain off the solids and you are left with homemade chicken stock–that you literally made from what you would have thrown in the trash!! *Get the full recipe on how to make chicken stock using your kitchen scraps, here. And now you are well on your way to creating the week’s remaining entrees.*If your family prefers more spice try out my Buffalo Chicken and Rice.Take a look at that!Pat yourself on the back. You now have a whole week of meals planned! Meals that are wholesome, filling, hearty, and NOT take-out! Job well done.A few notes:**********WOW!

222,"A delicious, hearty Lentil Soup is just 30 minutes away when you use your Pressure Cooker!Happy New Year friends! Each year on January 1 we celebrate with a hearty bowl of Lentil Soup. My grandma used to cook this family favorite on her stovetop for hours, but now we have this awesome Pressure Cooker (aka Instant Pot) that cooks our favorite good luck soup in a fraction of the time.Why is this considered a “good luck” soup? Italians eat lentils on New Year’s for wealth and prosperity because the flat beans were believed to resemble Roman coins, and now it’s a tradition that’s followed around the world. Our soup is made with salty ham, because my grandma also believed in the superstition that pork was also good luck. Pigs root forward as they eat, as opposed to the back-scratching of chickens and turkeys and so is considered a symbol of progress, of moving forward in the New Near rather than backward.We look forward to these traditions each year, even long after my grandma passed nearly 10 years ago. My kids love this thick, rich soup just as much as the grown-ups do, and we eat it year round, not just at New Year’s. The ham bone adds tons of flavor, and getting one that’s got a good amount of meat on it gives you some meat to shred right into the soup. We usually pick one up at the Honeybaked Ham store. Of course you can use a ham bone from your local grocery store along with some diced up ham (this is a great use for leftover ham!). Being the good Germans we are, we enjoy our slathered over a hot bowl of Spatzle, but you can enjoy the soup on it’s own just as much. Don’t forget to add a dollop of sour cream for richness!For more delicious soup recipes, try these:White Bean , Kale & Sausage SoupHamburger SoupChicken & Corn ChowderTurkey, Kale and Rice SoupFor all Soup recipes go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Hi!

223,"Such a hearty, creamy, comforting bowl of soup – This Chicken & Corn Chowder comes together super quick in just one big pot making it perfect for busy weeknights.When someone tells you, “this is my favorite soup that you’ve ever made” you know you have a winner. That’s what I heard multiple times from my family while we enjoyed this soup on a cold winter night. I won’t lie, it really is delicious, and it may just be my favorite soup yet.Now, before you get all up in arms screaming that this isn’t “chowder,” I will admit that you’r kind of right. Chowders are typically thickened with a roux of sorts, and I didn’t do that. So, it’s more chowder-esque. But that’s ok, because it totally scrumptious. Not to worry though, I’ll include thickening instructions in the recipe in case you want to do that.So what makes this soup so creamy if you aren’t thickening it? Well, cream for starters. I used a combination of one part heavy cream and one part nonfat milk. You could also use all heavy cream or even Half & Half for a richer soup but I like to reduce the fat and calories a tad by using the nonfat milk. This Chicken & Corn Chowder is super versatile – you could add some cream cheese or even some nice cheddar for extra flavor. If you want to save on calories, you could leave the cream out all together.Whichever way you make it, make it your own – that’s what cooking is all about!

Season with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, for several minutes until translucent. Add garlic and cook for about a minute. Stir in green chiles, corn, creamed corn, chicken, potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are cooked and fork tender; about 25-30 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in heavy cream and milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped green onions and fresh parsley, if desired.To thicken, if you desire, ladle about 1/2 cup of the broth in a small bowl and whisk in 2 tablespoons of flour. Once completely combined, pour this mixture into the soup. It will thicken in minutes upon standing.*Instead of heavy cream and nonfat milk, you could replace with half & half, or use all heavy cream or all nonfat milk, if you choose."
224,"Tender, fresh Turkey Meatballs  are smothered in a homemade Spicy Pineapple Barbecue Sauce. Full of sweet and spicy flavor, these meatballs will steal the show for sure when served as a party appetizer or as a dinner entree!I love to make meatballs from scratch. My kids like to get in on the action too. Frozen meatballs just never taste fresh, they get freezer burn and well, they just don’t taste as good. So we opt to make our meatballs from scratch ever time. Like this, and this.People don’t seem to like to make meatballs because they’re messy. I mean, who wants to throw their hands into a big bowl of squishy ground meat? Your kids do!! This is one of the best ways to get your kids involved in the kitchen – getting them to do those tasks that you just aren’t a fan of. My son loves getting messy so this is a perfect way to let him help.               First you squish all the meatball ingredients together, then you plop them down on a foil lined baking sheet. I use a cookie scoop for measuring so they will cook evenly. Pop the meatballs in the oven and make the barbecue sauce, which needs just three ingredients. Combine the spicy barbecue sauce, pineapple juice and crushed pineapple together in a saute pan. I like using the saute pan because it’s flat bottomed but larger than a saucepan and not as deep, so when you add the meatballs they won’t get lost in there. I’m kind of in love with this saute pan; it’s heavy and has a copper bottom which really helps with even heating.          Let that sauce get all bubbly and turn the heat down a tad. Let it simmer because as it does the liquid will reduce down and the sauce will get thicker which will help it stick to the meatballs which is what makes them really yummy.The last step is, once the meatballs are cooked, to let them simmer in that delicious sauce for just a bit to soak up some of that flavor while they’re fresh out of the oven.Finally they are ready to serve. I love the Hawaiian vibe in these meatballs. The sweet and spicy sauce with the pineapple just sings Aloha to me! We have enjoyed these meatballs a multitude of ways, from toothpick appetizer style to serving it up with rice and veggies to lining them up on some fresh rolls. Whichever way you enjoy, they will be delicious and gone before you can say Mahalo!Want more great appetizers?

225,"Delicious and festive, these Cranberry Chicken Puffs will be a hit, every time!There are SO many things to do with leftover turkey or chicken. From casseroles to soups to enchiladas to salads, the sky’s the limit with these versatile fowl.But if you want to make something impressive and fancy, then you need to put these Cranberry Chicken Puffs on the menu.Let me show you how easy they are to make.First, you get two cans of crescent rolls. Open the cans and lay out the triangles of dough on a cutting board. (You’ll only be able to fit one can of dough at a time). Arrange the triangles so that two are together, forming a rectangle, Press together the seams  in the middle so that there is no split in the dough.Then you are going to take your chicken salad (made with shredded chicken, mayo, dried cranberries, mozzarella and green onions) and put 1/4 cup in the center of the rectangle.Now you start folding up the corners of the dough and stretching it so that you completely cover the chicken salad.Then just place the rolls seam-side down onto an un-greased cookie sheet. (You can use silicone mats or stoneware if desired).Then if you want to get really fancy, you can put chopped walnuts or pecans on top. (You can also mix them into the chicken salad, but I put them on top just in case people don’t like nuts or are allergic. If you are feeding guests, you may want to make some with and some without nuts, just in case).Then just bake for 12 minutes at 375 degrees, and voila! Dinner is served!Want some great sides for these Cranberry Chicken Puffs?

You should have 8 rectangles of dough.Put 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture into the center of each rectangle.Fold up the corners of the rectangle to cover the chicken mixture, pressing together to seal.Place seam-side down onto an un-greased cookie sheet.Bake at 375 degrees for 12 minutes, until top is golden brown.Note: If using stoneware, your baking time will be longer."
226,"When you want to bring something other than the same old boring appetizers to the party, this Buffalo Ranch Chicken French Bread Pizza fits the bill! Layers of creamy Ranch, tender chicken, spicy buffalo sauce and crunchy celery are finished off with Mozzarella and blue cheeses. Baked to perfection, this is a delicious appetizer or meal for holiday guests or game day parties!When I think of holiday food, “buffalo chicken” isn’t exactly what comes to mind. But let me point out two very important things. First, it’s good to be different, and let me tell you, your friends and family will appreciate having something other than grape jelly meatballs to enjoy. Second, it’s festive! I mean, just look at the bright green and red colors!I stopped at Walmart to get my weekly shopping done, and picked up everything I needed for this recipe. I also grabbed some Glad Press’n Seal®,, which I’ve never used before. (I’ve never had much luck with plastic wrap!) This stuff was super easy to use though, and it made a great cover for my phone. Why? Well when I plan out the recipes to share on this blog, I start by typing them out on the computer. Then I pull them up on my phone when I’m ready to start cooking. Problem is, I have to be super careful not to get food on my phone – I’ve already used my insurance once this year and don’t want to have to use it again! So I tried this trick of placing the Glad Press’n Seal over my phone to keep it clean, and it totally worked! It provided a custom fit that sealed and protected me phone! Kept my phone clean and didn’t move around like when I’ve used a plastic bag.We all know Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Dips Mix is the best when it comes to dips and dressings, but it’s great to use in tons of other recipes! I started with a cream cheese Ranch layer for my Buffalo Chicken French Bread Pizza. I combined the cream cheese with about half of the Ranch dip mix and some hot sauce.Once that was all combined and creamy, I spread it over the French bread halves. The next layer was shredded chicken mixed with celery, blue cheese and more buffalo hot sauce.The creamy ranch helps to cut the heat of the buffalo, and the blue cheese adds a nice tang. Finally the pizza is topped with a generous heap of Mozzarella cheese and baked until the cheesy is melted and bubbly.I added some parsley for color, but you can skip that step if you prefer. Finally, drizzle on some more buffalo sauce until you have the amount of heat you want. You could serve this as is or with a ranch or blue cheese dip. Don’t forget the celery sticks on the side!For more holiday entertaining tips and recipes, be sure to check out www.walmart.com/holidayfavoritesThis is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Glad & Hidden Valley Ranch.

227,"I adore my slow cooker and this time of year, one of my favorite choices for filling the ol’ crock pot is a big batch of soup. This Slow Cooker Cauliflower Soup with Pepper Jack and Bacon is not only creamy and comforting, but it’s also a nice balance of healthy (cue the boatload of cauliflower) and decadent (helloooo, cheese and bacon!). And you won’t believe how simple it is to make!Hi there, Yellow Bliss Road friends! It’s Samantha from Five Heart Home, and I’m so excited to be back for another round of Slow Cooker Sundays!This recipe starts with frozen cauliflower florets, because it doesn’t get much easier than cutting open a bag, am I right? After tossing said cauliflower into the slow cooker, season with some garlic salt and pepper and pour in a few cups of broth. And then…walk away!The fun really begins after the cauliflower has cooked until tender, because here’s where your immersion blender (AKA, one of my favorite kitchen appliances EVER) comes in. If you don’t have an immersion blender, GET ONE! Just kidding. 😉 As much as I love my immersion blender, you can totally achieve a smooth soup by transferring it in batches to a food processor or blender and pureeing until smooth.Once your soup is creamy and free of chunks, stir in a cup of half-and-half. And then, to add zest to the mild-flavored cauliflower, blend in a few handfuls of shredded pepper jack cheese. If you don’t care for pepper jack, you may certainly substitute mild Monterrey jack or even sharp cheddar, but I enjoy the kick that pepper jack lends to this soup. Last but not-on-your-life least, garnish your bowl with crispy, salty diced bacon. And by garnish, I mean LOAD. IT. UP! The more bacon the better has always been my mantra.Before I share the recipe, I’m going to let you in on one last little secret. If you think your family might balk at an all-cauliflower soup, you can swap out half of the cauliflower for peeled, cubed potatoes. Once pureed together, the cauliflower flavor will be less noticeable and, with a little cheese and bacon, unsuspecting picky eaters might not even detect that it’s there! Just be sure to hide the frozen cauliflower bags at the bottom of the trash can so you don’t get busted…not that I’ve ever been so careless. 😉So who’s ready for a cozy, silky soup that’s loaded with vitamins but also loads o’ fun to eat (because have I mentioned BACON)? Slow Cooker Cauliflower Soup with Pepper Jack and Bacon makes a warm, delicious lunch or dinner any time of year, but particularly when there’s a chill in the air. It’s so easy to make that it hardly counts as cooking, and therein lies the beauty of the slow cooker. Hope y’all enjoy adding this recipe to your crock pot arsenal!SLOW COOKER CAULIFLOWER SOUP WITH PEPPER JACK AND BACONNOTESYou may use vegetable stock if you like. You may also replace the half-and-half with additional stock, if you prefer. The type of stock or broth you use is going to dictate if you need to add additional salt at the end or not.For the dairy, you can use 2%, whole milk, half-and-half, heavy cream…it’s up to you! But obviously, the fattier the milk product you use, the richer and creamier the final soup is going to be.You may swap out the pepper jack cheese for Monterrey jack, sharp cheddar, or whatever your favorite may be.If you don’t have an immersion blender, you may purée this soup in batches using a food processor or blender. Just allow it to cool down a bit before doing so, work with small batches at a time (don’t fill your blender more than half way!), and leave the top of the blender cracked so that steam can escape and soup doesn’t explode everywhere!I’d love for you to visit me sometime at Five Heart Home, where I share quick and easy, family-friendly, real food recipes like these:Holiday Honeycrisp Salad     Perfect Chicken & Dumplings     And if you love slow cooker recipes as much as I do, I recently wrote a cookbook with 80 slow cooker dinner recipes made with real, unprocessed ingredients!

It’s a classic meat and potatoes dish that is easy to make and uses ingredients that you usually have on hand. With the added vegetables, it’s a meal all on it’s own!I’ve never seen a slow cooker adaptation of this recipe and I was really excited to try it out. Instead of ground beef, this recipe uses chuck roast cut into cubes like stew meat, which becomes so tender and delicious in the slow cooker. The meat is cooked with some hearty veggies, like carrots and mushrooms, in a rich sauce of beef broth, tomato paste and spices. The smell is glorious wafting through the house as it cooks all day long!The potatoes can be made ahead of time, or about an hour before you’re ready to serve dinner. You can make your own from scratch (recommended) or use frozen or box spuds if you’re short on time. About 20 minutes before dinner, thicken the gravy and spread the mashed potatoes over the meat and veggies, then cover and cook just long enough to heat the potatoes through.The Real Food Slow Cooker Suppers Cookbook makes an excellent gift for the holidays, or just for yourself!

Top with the garlic, carrots, mushrooms and corn. In a medium bowl, whisk together the beef broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, oregano and House Seasoning. Pour the mixture over the contents of the slow cooker and stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 7 to 9 hours, or high for 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours, until the beef is tender.To make the mashed potatoes, place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover them with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat and stir in the salt. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender when stabbed with a fork (start checking them at 15 minutes).Drain the potatoes, and return them to the pot.

Cover the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 15 to 30 minutes, until the gravy is thickened and the Mashed Potatoes are heated through.*Many of the recipes in this cookbook call for House Seasoning.

Mix these together in a small bowl and store the House Seasoning in an airtight container."
230,"A classic comfort food that is baked with spinach, ziti noodles, pasta sauce, and a variety of cheeses. It’s easy to make and perfect for a crowd.I really like making pasta dishes, and lasagna is one of my favorite pasta dishes to make and eat. The only downfall with lasagna is that it takes a decent amount of time to put together. Time is the reason why I have fallen in love with making baked ziti. It is very similar to lasagna: there is ricotta, mozzarella, noodles, pasta sauce and other add-ins of your choosing in Baked Ziti, but it comes together in half the amount of time.I can’t stress enough how easy this recipe is to make. You could even prepare it the evening before and refrigerate until you are ready to bake it. I love that it can easily feed a crowd. I would say that it feeds 6 people if you are not serving a side, like salad or another veggie. If you are serving a side, this ziti can easily feed 10 people. I served this baked ziti with a salad with one of our veryown Italian dressings and a quick piece of stovetop garlic bread.This recipe for baked ziti is a meatless version. I chose to use spinach instead of Italian sausage, bu Italian sausage can easily be added to the pasta sauce. If you are having a hard time finding ziti noodles, you can substitute with penne, rotini, or any shape that is somewhat similar to a ziti noodle.For more delicious pasta dishes, try these:Zucchini & Sausage Stuffed ShellsCreamy, Four-Cheese SpaghettiPumpkin AlfredoFor all pasta recipes go HERE.For all main course entrees go HERE.For the Recipe Index go HERE.","Start by boiling a large pot of water for the noodles and cook noodles according to the package instruction. Toss the noodles with a little olive oil so that the noodles do not stick.Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.In a large saucepan or large skillet over medium-high heat add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the diced onions, saute for 2 minutes and then add the Italian seasoning, red pepper, and garlic, saute for additional 1 minute. Add the marinara sauce and spinach, stir until everything is incorporated.In a 13by9 in baking dish add a quarter of the spinach pasta sauce to the bottom of the dish, spread over the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the sauce with 1 cup Mozzarella and half of the ricotta. I did this by dropping 8-10 dollops of ricotta evenly throughout the baking dish. Then pour the noodles into the dish, then add the rest of the ricotta mixture, add again spread evenly as dollops. Then spread the rest of the sauce over the noodles and ricotta. Top with the parmesan cheese and remaining mozzarella.Bake for 20 minutes until lightly brown on top.If taking the ziti from out the refrigerator, it might need 30-35 minutes to get hot and bubbly. I would also suggest covering the baking dish with aluminum foil and removing for the last 5 minutes of baking so that it can get slightly brown on top."
231,"This White Bean, Kale & Sausage Soup is creamy, spicy and all around delicious. It’s perfect for warming up during those cold winter months.It’s finally getting chilly here in So Cal, which means it’s dipping down to the high-50s at night. It also means it’s soup season, which is my very favorite season of all!Soup is pretty much our favorite thing to eat, and it’s my favorite thing to cook. Ask my kids what their favorite thing is the mom cooks and they are likely to say THIS soup or THIS soup, or maybe even THIS soup. Truth be told, I love them all, but this one that I’m about to share with you, this one is my new favorite.Because of our move, I had a month’s worth of clean out the pantry type cooking. I came across these two cans of Cannelini beans, unsure of what to do with them. I knew that I loved beans in soup, but determining what kind of soup was a mystery. During this time we ate dinner at Olive Garden, and I indulged in my favorite Zuppa Tuscana. That’s when inspiration struck and I decided THAT is what I could do with the white beans! They take the place of the potato, the spicy andouille (which is amazing in this soup by the way) takes the place of the Italian sausage.          To say that this soup was perfect would be an understatement. The tender sausage and creamy white beans and complimented by the hearty kale, all swimming in a spicy, rich broth. It’s the ultimate comfort food for a cold, rainy day!For more delicious soup recipes, try these:Hamburger SoupTortellini Tomato SoupCreamy Chicken and Wild Rice SoupGreen Chile Chicken Enchilada SoupFor all Soups go HERE, for all Entrees go HERE and for the complete recipe index go HERE./div>Hi!

232,"Savory ham and sharp Sargento® cheddar slices are rolled up in pizza dough and baked with a sweet and tangy sauce on top. These Baked Ham & Cheese Roll-Ups are easy to make, and so delicious, they are perfect for feeding a crowd on game day! This post brought to you by Sargento® Cheese. The content and opinions expressed below are that of Yellow Bliss Road.Cheese seems to be a regular staple in my cooking, so it’s no surprise that I jumped at the chance to sample some delicious Sargento® Sliced Cheese recently. I like to consider myself somewhat of a cheese enthusiast. So believe me when I say that not all cheese is created equal. That’s why I prefer Sargento® – it’s 100% real, natural cheese! (I am always honest in my reviews and I can honestly say that Sargento® is my preferred brand). Most PPCF is only required to contain 51% real cheese. While this percentage may vary by brand, this is the minimum. But Sargento® is still 100% cheese.When considering what to make with these delicious cheese slices, I can up with this simple and easy recipe that will be perfect for your next gathering. Finger foods are super popular this time of year – at football parties, holiday gatherings or just for a fun after school snack.I paired the Sharp Cheddar slices with deli sliced ham, pizza dough and a creamy sauce of mustard, honey, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. The results were amazing! You can’t go wrong with a combo of ham and cheese, and the sweet and savory sauce on top really knocks this snack out of the park!          To make, just lay out the pizza dough in a rectangle shape and arrange the ham and cheddar cheese slices evenly on top. Then roll into a log shape, starting at the long end for smaller roll-ups, and the short end for larger roll-ups.Slice the log into 1-2″ pieces and arrange on a foil covered baking sheet and brush with some of the sauce. I sprinkled sesame seeds on top of the rolls for fun. Bake for about 12 minutes then brush on the remaining sauce.

233,"This Slow Cooker Beefy Three-Bean is so rich and hearty and full of flavor, it’s sure to become a favorite recipe!Hi, friends! It’s Samantha from Five Heart Home, and I’m so happy to be visiting y’all today for Slow Cooker Sundays!I’ve been a huge fan of slow cooker recipes for a long time, as they often come to my rescue in getting a home-cooked meal on the table when I’m having a crazy day — and let’s face it…that’s just about every day! But I have a particularly special place in my heart for slow cooker dinner recipes made with real, unprocessed ingredients, seeing as how I just recently released an entire cookbook of them. And today, I’m excited to be sharing one of those recipes with you all!Beefy Three-Bean Chili is actually one of my family’s favorite recipes from the cookbook. Where we live, “true Texas chili” is made with big chunks of beef and no beans. This chili, on the other hand, is loaded with not only ground beef, but three different types of beans — pintos, kidneys, and black beans. It’s hearty, it’s comforting, and it’s full of flavor!This recipe comes together in a matter of minutes. It’s as easy as browning a pound of brown beef and tossing it in the slow cooker with the aforementioned beans, garlic, diced tomatoes, and a perfect balance of chili seasonings. I like to add a bottle of dark Mexican beer for depth of flavor (although you may certainly substitute beef broth), and I toss in a minced chipotle pepper in adobo sauce for heat with a touch of smokiness.It’s actually easy to customize the spice level of your chili by adding your chipotle accordingly. For mild chili, simply stir a spoonful of adobo sauce into your chili and forgo the chipotle pepper itself. For slightly spicy chili, slice open a chipotle, scrape out and discard the seeds, and then mince up the pepper to add to the chili. For chili with more kick, add some extra adobo sauce, leave the chipotle seeds intact, or increase the number of peppers used. Do you think you can handle the heat?! 😉One of my favorite things about chili is dressing it up with lots of yummy toppings. My crew enjoys this Beefy Three-Bean Chili with a dollop of sour cream, a pinch of grated cheddar, and a sprinkle of fresh chopped cilantro on top. But feel free to go crazy with your favorite garnishes — diced avocado, crumbled cotija cheese, a squeeze of lime…the world is your chili bowl!So who’s ready to ring in crisp fall weather with a steamy bowl of chili? This beef- and bean-loaded slow cooker version is not only tasty and satisfying, but it makes the whole house smell incredible as it pretty much cooks itself. Hope your whole family loves it as much as mine does!Thanks so much for inviting me over today, Kristin, and I had such a great time visiting with you, Yellow Bliss Road readers! If you enjoy quick and easy, family-friendly, real food recipes, I’d love for you to come visit me sometime over at Five Heart Home. 🙂For more Slow Cooker Sunday recipes, try these:Slow Cooker Chicken StewSlow Cooker Asian ChickenEasy Slow Cooker Shredded ChickenFor more slow cooker recipes, go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.Hi!

Drain the grease and season with the salt and pepper to taste.In a large slow cooker, combine the cooked ground beef, black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, chiptole pepper, adobo sauce, garlic, diced tomatoes, beer, chili powder, cumin, coriander, Mexican oregano, and paprika. Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or on high for 3 to 4 hours. Adjust the seasonings with additional salt and pepper, if desired.

234,"These Slow Cooker Blackberry Orange Barbecue Chicken Drumsticks are an easy way to satisfy your family’s craving for barbecue in the dead of winter, or any time during the year! (This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Huggies® Wipes. As always, all opinions are my own.)I {big puffy heart} love my slow cooker. It has saved me on those busy days when I know I won’t have a lot of time to prepare a meal after returning home from work or errands or football practice…or just when I don’t really feel like “cooking.”I mentioned a while back that we are moving in a few weeks and I have been trying to clean out our freezer. I seem to have stockpiled enough to feed a small army in there so I’ve been slowly working through it. This week’s triumph was this Blackberry Orange Barbecue Chicken. The sauce is semi-homemade, with bottled barbecue sauce, seedless blackberry preserves and orange marmalade, red pepper flakes and a little liquid smoke. A plain, basic barbecue sauce works best rather than a sweet or spicy one, since you’re adding the sweet and a little spicy.          Slow cooking makes the meat so tender it’s literally falling off the bone, but you have to be careful not to leave the meat in the slow cooker for so long that the fall apart. Still would be delicious but a little harder to eat!Now you can eat this chicken straight out of the slow cooker. I like to add cornstarch the sauce to get that nice thick, rich texture to the sauce and then put the chicken under the broiler to caramelize and give it a nice little char.My kids love this recipes and my daughter, who used to despise messy food, has come to love these little photo shoots where she gets to get all messy-faced. The eating part is where it gets a little messy which is why we keep Huggies® Wipes on hand to clean up said messy face.Keeping these pretty packs around has been a lifesaver in times like these. Huggies® Wipes are thick and durable, so they stand up to these big messes. I have super sensitive skin and they are so gentle that I use them to remove my makeup, too.You can join Huggies® #HugTheMessSweepstakes or visit them at Huggies.com.

235,"This Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Soup has all the flavors of our favorite Enchiladas, no rolling required! It’s an easy recipe to whip up on a busy weeknight.As long as I can remember, Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas have been one of my favorite things to make, and to enjoy. I shared my recipe a few months back, and it’s been popular here on the blog, too! The casserole is so easy to make, and this soup is even easier!This is basically that favorite recipe in soup form, except for the addition of some salsa just to help add a little more heat and flavor.If you’ve been with us for long enough, you know how much I like easy recipes. Well this one couldn’t be easier. It starts with sauteed onions and garlic, then cooked, shredded chicken, chicken broth, salsa, enchilada sauce and green chiles. All of that yumminess is simmered for about 20 minutes and then comes the cheese. Cream cheese, cheddar cheese and jack cheese make this soup rich and creamy.  You can serve this soup just like this, or you could add some cooked white rice, or even a cup of my favorite Mexican Rice. Wow, wouldn’t that be amazing?! Finally top it with some pretty garnishes like sour cream, shredded cheese, tortilla strips and cilantro.

236,"This Pan Seared Salmon with Honey Dijon Butter is simple and easy and full of flavor, and it cooks right on your stove-top in just 12 minutes. A special thanks to All-Clad for letting me try out their new d3 Armor Fish Pan for this recipe! Be sure to read all the way through the post – you can enter to win your very own All Clad Fish Pan!Salmon has been a favorite in our home for years. There are so many ways to prepare it, but my kids actually prefer it simply grilled with salt and pepper and sometimes a little lemon. My preference however is to add a little (or a lot) of flavor to my salmon by infusing it with marinades or especially a nice teriyaki sauce.This Pan Seared Salmon with Honey Dijon Butter is a perfect comprise – my kids like the simple salt and pepper seasoning and I like that I can add the flavor that I crave by topping my piece with the compound butter.If you’ve never made a compound butter, it’s super easy! Just take some softened butter and add a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. Or you can add fresh herbs like dill and chives, or maple syrup in place of the honey. The possibilities are endless! Just scoop it on top of your fish (I used a regular cookie scoop) and let that buttery goodness just melt all over the fish creating a delectable, creamy sauce.          I was super excited to try out my new All-Clad d3 Armor Fish Pan and since salmon is something we cook at least once a week I knew it was the right fish to christen the new pan with. The Fish Pan has a unique shape that is perfect for cooking fish. The riveted surface on the interior of this stainless-steel fish pan promotes effortless release and easy cleanup without compromising exceptional browning and searing capabilities. Its oval shape is perfect for cooking whole filets and delicate seafood, as well as steaks and omelettes. The pan is designed with low, flared sides to contain splatters and a long handle for safe easy transfer from stovetop to oven to your plate!So what did I think of this Fish Pan? I think it’s pretty great! It cooks evenly and true to its promise it released the fish quite nicely. I had about a 1.5 pound salmon filet that I cut into 4 pieces and that amount just fit into the pan. So it’s great for a family of 4. One of the drawbacks of stainless steel is that it can be more difficult to clean up. The bottom of the pan cleaned up nicely while the sides where the oil had splattered and stuck required a little more elbow grease. Ultimately though it was awesome and I can’t wait to use it again!Would you like to win an All Clad d3 Armor Fish Pan fo ryour very own? Enter using the Rafflecopter widget below.

237,"This Slow Cooker Chicken Stew is the perfect meal to warm you up this fall. Bonus, it cooks in the slow cooker all day, and is ready just when you need it on a busy weeknight.Soups are my absolute favorite way to warm on cold fall or winter’s night. We don’t get many of them here in Southern California, but when we do, soups are my go-to. There’s nothing like a big heaping bowl of steaming hot soup, with tender vegetables and meat in a savory broth.Soup recipes transfer really easily from stove-top to slow cooker, too. Need it quick? Cook it on the stove. Planning ahead? Throw the ingredients in your slow cooker. Easy peasy.          Chicken Stew is basically my favorite chicken soup recipe with the pasta swapped out for potatoes and a little cornstarch slurry to thicken it up, making it super rich and hearty. This soup recipe has lots of veggies, and you could change those up, too, based on your personal tastes or what’s in your fridge.I don’t often use chicken thighs, but I really like them in this chicken stew. Because they have more fat than the super lean chicken breasts, they can stand up to the longer slow cooker time without drying out. The potatoes can take a long time to cook, so this makes thighs the perfect choice. Plus they have a richer flavor and texture for a more luxurious feel.You might also enjoy these delicious recipes:Arizona Chicken Corn ChowderHot & Sour Potsticker SoupTurkey, Kale & Rice SoupBasic Beef Stew For all slow cooker recipes go HERE, for all soups go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.Hi!

Enjoy it sliced as a roast or shredded in a rice bowl.When it comes to needed easy weeknight meals in my arsenal, my Slow Cooker is at the top of my list of favorite kitchen equipment. I use it several times a week all throughout the year from All-Purpose Shredded Chicken to fabulous Mexican Beans. It definitely makes my nights so much easier!We are getting ready to move to a new home and I have been cleaning out my freezer. Apparently I have stock-piled all kinds of proteins to last us for the next ten years. Since I am not willing to “move” an entire freezer full of food, it became clear that I needed to use it up. That revelation became a challenge and I’m trying to come up with new and different ways to cook all this meat.This Pork Loin was my first victim. It actually started as a variation of my Brown Sugar and Garlic Barbecue Chicken…until I realized I didn’t have an barbecue sauce. So I had to change my plan, and this Teriyaki Pork is what came about.               It’s got a great combination of sweet and salty, and it delicious as a roast with the teriyaki sauce, or shredded and served over rice with some steamed veggies.For more Slow Cooker meals, try these:Slow Cooker Creamy Taco Ranch ChickenSlow Cooker Kalua PorkMexican BeefEasy Slow Cooker CarnitasFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for the Recipe Index go HERE.Hi!

240,"Four creamy cheeses envelope tender macaroni, savory chicken and crisp bacon to create the ultimate comfort food – Chicken, Bacon and Blue Macaroni and Cheese!About 4 years ago on a trip to San Diego we tried a newly opened restaurant called Stacked. This particular chain hadn’t made it’s way north to Orange County where we lived yet, and some friends had recommended we try it during our trip. We were there for two nights, and both nights we ate at Stacked! To top it off, I ordered the same dish both nights…and the two times after that when we returned a year and two years later.Imagine my delight when last summer I noticed a new restaurant being built near our home and the sign said “STACKED – coming soon!” I couldn’t wait for the opening, and I new just what I was going to order. That dish that I have now ordered each of the 5 times I’ve been to that restaurant – Stacked Mac & Cheese! The thing I love about this restaurant (and no, this is not a sponsored post!) is that you can customize your food just the way you like it. Try something completely new and different or just be able to be your picky self with no judgement – and it’s all done on ipads at your table!               I figured if I loved a dish that much I needed to try and recreate it at home. There are three main cheeses in this ultra creamy sauce – cheddar, pepper jack, American. The sauce is poured over tender elbow macaroni and then the blue cheese, chicken and bacon is stirred in. The macaroni and cheese is all baked to perfection with a crispy Parmesan breadcrumb crust. I’m not sure they use a sauce at the restaurant, they might just stir in the cheeses, but I’m a big fan of the creamy cheese sauce and that’s what I like to make at home.This meal is definitely an indulgence, so you might want to make it sparingly…say, once a week max.Looking for more Mac & Cheese recipes or Comfort Food ideas?

I thought it would be fun to do a play on that recipe, but for breakfast. As luck would have it, this Breakfast Enchilada Casserole turned out even more amazing than I expected.The layer method is the same and the flavors are very similar, only instead of chicken, you’re using scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage!

Of course there’s lots of cheese, and a creamy green chile enchilada sauce to top it off.It sounds like a lot of steps, but they are really, really easy steps. First cook the elements of the casserole: Scrambled eggs with salsa, bacon, sausage, tater tots. Combine the green chile enchilada sauce with some sour cream.Then layer it all together like this: Creamy green chile enchilada sauce, tortillas (broken to fit the casserole dish), scrambled eggs mixed with salsa, bacon, sausage, tater tots, cheese.

243,"This Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice Soup is rich and flavorful and just right for when you’re craving a little comfort food.Is it ok if I tell you just how surprised I was at how good this soup came out? I mean, I kind of doubted myself for a little bit…but you can keep that just between us, right?It was 90 degrees in the shade and I had decided to make soup. But I didn’t want just any soup, I wanted super comforting, ultra creamy, chicken and rice soup. I had a ton of shredded chicken that I’d made in the slow cooker (recipe HERE) so I knew it wouldn’t take too long.I sauteed some carrots, celery and onion, then added some spices and seasonings that I randomly grabbed from my pantry. Yes, I seriously looked into my spice cabinet and thought “that sounds good, let’s use that!” Of course there was garlic, and also some bay leaves, thyme and oregano, then salt and pepper. It smelled ah-mazing!!Next in went the chicken broth and the shredded chicken, and it was all brought to a boil then simmered for about 20 minutes. The final step was to whisk together the heavy cream and milk with some flour, then pour that along with the wild rice into the pot. Another 20 minutes and that soup was creamy, bubbly and absolutely delicious.The soup did thicken quite a bit while standing, so it was more like a stew by the time we ate it. I just added a little more chicken broth and it was perfect. The nuttiness of the wild rice gives a lovely earthiness that compliments the creamy broth. We’ll definitely be enjoying this over and over this fall for sure!For more soup recipes, try these: Arizona Chicken Corn ChowderHearty Chicken SoupTortellini Tomato Soup with Italian SausageHamburger SoupFor all soup recipes go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.KristinHi!

244,"Tender, flavorful meatballs, made with spicy Italian sausage and just a few other basic ingredients. Easy to whip up for a weeknight, and nice enough for Sunday dinner.If you’re anything like me, Italian sausage meatballs might sound a little weird. At least that’s what I thought when the idea came to me. My son really wanted meatballs to go with our spaghetti but I didn’t have any of my homemade meatballs left in the freezer, and no ground…anything…except sausage.Now, while I may not be the first person to come up with this idea, I’m claiming it as a good one. There is such a good flavor and the texture is tender with a slight bite. The sausage is combined with breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese and an egg, similar to basic meatballs. I also added some sauteed onions and garlic that give a nice, smokey, slightly sweet flavor.I don’t usually worry too much about the shape, but I do use a cookie scoop because it makes my life much, much easier. It’s also easy enough for my kids to use. The sausage meatballs are shaped into a ball and then baked for about 18-20 minutes.They might still be slightly pink in the middle but you’re going to keep cooking them in the sauce anyway, so it will be fine. If you’re not planning to cook them in the sauce, make sure they are fully cooked before serving. We love them with spaghetti and our favorite sauce, wither homemade or jarred, but I imagine they’d be really delicious on a sub sandwich!For more delicious pasta dishes, try these:One Pan Parmesan MeatballsSpaghetti PomodoroCreamy 4-Cheese SpaghettiLasagna Roll-UpsFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for our Recipe Index, go HERE.Hi!

245,"Hey guys! Sam back from The Culinary Compass! I’m SOOO excited to bring you the recipe for this awesome Baked Caprese Chicken. It’s got all sorts of summery flavors straight from the garden plus it’s simple so extra bonus points!I don’t know about you, but I’m a huge sucker for anything with a tomato, basil, mozzarella, and balsamic combination. When the summertime comes around and the basil plant is overflowing and tomatoes are all but falling off the vine, caprese salads are my go-to.I figured those flavors would go great with a balsamic marinated piece of baked chicken and I was right! I just threw some balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and some salt in pepper in a gallon bag with the chicken breasts just to give the chicken a little more flavor. About 30 minutes is perfect, but you can get away with just 15 minutes if you’re strapped for time!Between the marinade and baking the chicken, it comes out so tender and juicy. Make sure that the internal temperature reaches 165° before you add the mozzarella and tomatoes on top though! It should take around 30 minutes in the oven at 400°, but you know how particular those get sometimes. If you add the mozzarella too soon, it melts straight to the pan which is just a party foul for everyone involved.The great part about this recipe is that you can eat it by itself, on a salad, in a wrap, or with some pasta on the side! I opted for some angel hair on the side because, well, it’s pasta. The chicken ends up so juicy that you don’t even need a sauce for the pasta for it to still go well together.This recipe calls for a balsamic glaze if you have it. I’ve started to use that to save time instead of having to reduce balsamic vinegar every time you want to use it. If you want to learn how to make it, read through this Rustic Pizza with Goat Cheese andBalsamic Reduction recipe! (Also, make the recipe. SO, so good)I mean, come on you guys.

247,"This Creamy Taco Ranch Chicken is a quick and easy pantry recipe that cooks all day in your slow cooker. The sauce is rich and creamy and super flavorful, and the chicken tender and delicious.When your entire family gobbles their dinner down in 5 minutes flat, you know you’ve got a good one! That’s pretty much what happened with this Slow Cooker Taco Ranch Chicken. It had been cooking since late morning, so when the kids got home from school they immediately noticed the scent wafting through the house. It was like grandma’s kitchen and your favorite Mexican restaurant all rolled in to one.Then when I served it on a bed of my favorite Mexican Rice and watched my daughter scarf more than half of her portion before I’d even sat down, well, I knew I couldn’t wait to share it with you!I love that it’s full of ingredients that I always have in my pantry – canned tomatoes and corn, black beans, taco seasoning, ranch seasoning, onion, garlic and cream cheese. These are staples that I regular cook with, but had never used in quite this combination.Of course the best part is you just dump it all into the slow cooker (except the cream cheese) and let the machine do it’s thing.                    You can serve this over rice, in tortillas (wouldn’t this make a fantastic burrito??), with pasta or just on it’s own.

248,"Hey everyone, my name is Keturah from Two Sisters Kitchens! I want to share with you a favorite recipe of mine – Beer Can Chicken!  It is a great summertime grilling staple, and I hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I do.Before I had ever attempted to make this recipe, I was always skeptical.  Could the beer really make a difference when grilling a whole chicken?  Well let me tell you it sure does!!!  It keeps it moist and even though, in my opinion, you don’t actually taste the beer, you know its the key to this chicken being so scrumptious. Plus the can of beer helps the bird sit up right on your grill.  I use this nifty wrack that holds the beer can and chicken so it doesn’t topple over, but it’s not necessary to have.One of the best things about this recipe is that once it’s on the grill, you have a good amount of time to get all the other loose ends tied up before dinner is served.  So that’s when I like to set the table, finish up any sides I’m making, and maybe fold a load of laundry! The less hectic it is getting dinner on the table, the better!I like to keep the seasoning pretty simple on my version of the beer can chicken because it doesn’t need a lot of seasoning to help out with the flavor.  But you can try any type of dry seasoning that makes your mouth water.  Possibilities are endless!  Now all that’s left to do is grill this recipe up yourself and enjoy!You might also enjoy these chicken recipes:Citrus Grilled ChickenHawaiian Barbecue ChickenEasy Slow Cooker Shredded ChickenBaked Chicken BreastFor more chicken recipes, go HERE.For all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hey everyone, I’m a wife and a mom of three adorable boys and I love to cook for my family and friends.

(*I like to rotate the chicken around halfway through the cooking time).Remove from grill and let sit for 10 minutes before removing beer can and carving."
249,"The bright burst of lemon and the saltiness of the capers make this One Pan Chicken Piccata meal a dish that your family will remember!Chicken Piccata is my absolutely favorite meal. Like, death row, last meal kind of favorite meal. I love the lemon, the creaminess and the capers. It’s just this amazing burst of flavor that really wakes your palate. This is almost always what I order at my favorite Italian restaurants, and I’ve made similar dishes at home, but this one is the closest I’ve come to that delicious flavor.Since we all know that I love One Pan Meal, I took this Lemon Chicken Piccata, which can be time consuming to make, to task. The result was this ultra creamy, lemony-tart, salty, amazing sauce. To save time, I opted to not bread the chicken. Chicken pieces are sauteed in olive oil just until they are browned and then combined with chicken broth, water, heavy cream, garlic, lemon juice and zest and the pasta.Now, there are 2 ways you can cook your one pan meals. There’s the fix it and forget it (cover the pan and simmer for 20-25 minutes) or stand and cook it (cook and stir uncovered at a higher heat for about 10 minutes). So, really, depending on the time you have you can choose the method you prefer. I’ve come to prefer the stand and cook it method because 1) it’s quicker, 2) the chicken sometimes comes out a little dry with the covered method, and 3) I can constantly monitor the doneness and stop cooking when the pasta is perfect.                    To step up the “creaminess” factor I added some soft cream cheese at the end, just before stirring in the Parmesan and capers. It just put the whole dish over the top.If you’re a fan of Lemon Chicken Piccata like me, you definitely need to give this a go. I promise you won’t regret it!Want more One Pan Meals?

Continue to boil, stirring often, until pasta is tender; about 11-13 minutes (depending on the type of pasta this time could vary - a good rule of thumb is to follow the time on the box and add a minute or two). *If the water seems to evaporate too quickly, add another 1/2 cup of warm water to the pasta.

250,"Hey all! Sam back from The Culinary Compass to share another one of my favorite recipes! One of my favorite parts  of summer is grilling food for dinner with friends and family and being able to sit around and chat while the food is cooking. With these Foil Packet Sausages with Peppers & Onions, all you have to do is assemble and let the grill do the rest!I’m a huge fan of bratwurst sausages with peppers and onions since it’s such a quick meal. I’ve found that throwing them all together in a foil packet with a little liquid to steam them is the fastest way to cook everything. This also produces the least amount of dishes which is perfect for weeknights! *Note: You don’t have to use Bratwurst, try Italian Sausages or any other favorite!I have tried both a light beer and chicken broth as the liquid to steam with. Both produced great results and really give the sausages extra flavor of whatever you end up choosing. If you have a little extra broth leftover, try using that. If you love beer and want to infuse your sausages with some beer flavor, try that!Since using the liquid and enclosing everything in the foil packet steams the sausages, the casings turn almost a pale white. It doesn’t look super appetizing at first, but allowing a few minutes on either side of the sausage to sit on the grill to give grill marks makes it look much better. One thing I love about steaming is the fact that you get a great pop from the casings when you bite into them. You can also toast the buns on the grill to give it that extra char and flavor. You can definitely add more veggies to a foil packet to serve as a side with all of the great farmers market produce out now! Try a few different colored peppers for an even more colorful and exciting dish! Looking for another great recipe to try on the grill? Try these Grilled Kielbasa and Veggie Kabobs!

Sprinkle salt and pepper on each set of sausages. Mix everything around to make sure it's fully coated.Bring the two short sides of the aluminum foil to the middle and fold over twice to shut. Fold either end of the packets twice to ensure the liquid won't escape. Repeat for the other packet. Place on the grill and cook for 15-18 minutes until sausages are cooked through and peppers and onions are tender.Open packets and leave open packets on the grill so the peppers and onions stay warm. Remove sausages and place directly on the grill. Cook on either side for 2-3 minutes to give sausages grill marks.Serve warm over a bun with a sausage, peppers, onions, and mustard. Enjoy!"
251,"These Zucchini Stuffed Shells with Italian Sausage are a great way to use that delicious zucchini that’s so bountiful this time of the year. Tender pasta shells filled with Ricotta and mozzarella cheese and shredded zucchini, smothered in a rich sausage marinara. Such an elegant weeknight dinner!It’s not likely to ever be easy to get my kids to eat their vegetables. They love salad, and a few other raw vegetables, but the cooked ones they often turn down their noses at. That’s why I love being able to sneak some extra veggies in there when I can.My kids loved these Chicken Alfredo Stuffed Shells so much that it left me wanting to make more recipes like it. I had a ton of zucchini from the Farmer’s Market and I love adding fresh zucchini to Italian dishes, like these Lasagna Roll Ups (with hidden veggies) so I knew I’d be able to pull it off in these Stuffed Shells.I combined the shredded zucchini with some Ricotta cheese, Parmesan and an egg.               After stuffing that yummy mixture into the pasta shells, I topped them with some Italian sausage and spaghetti sauce. You could use sweet or spicy, depending on your personal preference.Finally they get a nice coating of fresh Mozzarella cheese before they are baked in the oven. The whole process takes about 30 minutes, which makes this a perfect weeknight recipe. Plus, add a nice salad and dinner is done!

252,"This Creamy Chicken, Bacon & Ranch Baked Spaghetti casserole has all those beloved flavors, that are coated in a creamy, cheddar ranch sauce. It’s the ultimate indulgent weeknight dinner that’s easy to make and sure to please. Bacon + Cheese + Ranch. It’s become somewhat of a phenomenon. I mean, just try searching those three words together on Pinterest and you’ll see what I mean. Often times I’ve seen it called “crack,” perhaps because those flavors are so addictive together.Well, we love them too! Like in this Cheesy Bacon Ranch Dip or These Cheddar, Bacon & Ranch Pinwheels. It’s a magical combination that is tough to resist. And this Chicken, Bacon, Ranch Baked Spaghetti is no exception. This is such an easy dish to make with pre-cooked chicken (I cook mine like THIS so I always have some on hand), cooked spaghetti, bacon, and an easy to make creamy Cheddar Cheese & Ranch sauce.The sauce is basically chicken broth, milk, Ranch seasoning mix, flour, and cheddar cheese. Just boil the broth and while it’s boiling whisk together the flour, ranch mix and milk. This will be the flavoring and the thickening agent when added to the broth. Once that’s all combined the shredded cheddar is added to give it that creamy, cheesy texture. This stuff is so delicious you’ll have to hold yourself back from just slurping it up with a spoon!Once the sauce is made and you have all of your cooked ingredients (spaghetti, bacon, chicken) it’s time to layer them in a baking dish. First spaghetti, then about 3/4 of the sauce which is swirled in with the spaghetti, then chicken, bacon, more sauce and finally, shredded cheddar. It’s the stuff dreams are made of.

253,"These Chicken & Black Baked Tacos are so easy and tasty. They are the perfect quick meal for a busy weeknight, or when you’re feeding a crowd.We are taco fanatics at our house. We love tacos – chicken tacos, beef tacos, pork tacos…even lettuce wrap tacos! My kids get excited when they hear it’s taco night, and they love the oven baked tacos with the melty cheese so they are the most requested. Last Tuesday I decided to change things up a bit by making our favorite oven baked tacos with black beans and chicken instead of ground beef and refried beans.  Do you ever plan your menu while grocery shopping? I try to sit down and plan but honestly half the time I toss that out the window because I usually get inspired when I’m at the grocery store. Well last Tuesday I had an hour to kill so I did what any sane mom would do – I went to Target, Starbucks latte in hand. I had taken some chicken out for dinner but I still hadn’t decided what to do with it. As I was lazily strolling down the aisle it hit me – tacos! It just so happened that I was in the Mexican aisle when this happened. I wracked my brain trying to remember if I had taco shells and while I thought I had some, I figured I’d better buy a couple of new boxes just in case.So I got home and started to prepare dinner. I seasoned the chicken with a little taco seasoning and cooked it in a bit of olive oil. Then I drained and rinsed the black beans and stirred them in with a little salsa to round it all out. Then I opened up one of the packages of taco shells I bought. And they were ALL. BROKEN. Every single one. Dang – but at least I had bought two so I opened the other. And guess what? Yeah, they were ALL. BROKEN. Every single one. Thankfully I had just enough in my pantry to provide us with a decent dinner that night…a little stale, but they worked. But I won’t be buying taco shells at Target ever again!Boy, were they tasty, though! I’ll definitely be adding this recipe into the monthly rotation. Sans broken taco shells I hope.For more quick & easy dinner ideas, try these:Green Chile Chicken Enchilada NachosStovetop Cheesy Flatbread TacosParmesan Ranch Baked ChickenOne Pan Taco Macaroni and CheeseFor all dinner recipes go HERE. For our Recipe Index, go HERE.Hi!

254,"These Coconut Chicken Tenders are crispy, juicy and full of flavor. Serve them along with the spicy orange marmalade dipping sauce for a fun weeknight meal your family will love.Chicken tenders are a beloved favorite of most kids, mine included. But they are usually deep fried which obviously isn’t the most healthy. That’s why I like to bake mine any time I make them. My kids don’t seem to care – chicken tenders are a favorite no matter what, and these Baked Coconut Chicken Tenders were no exception!Instead of coating the chicken with breadcrumbs, I coated them just with coconut, trying to make them a little bit healthier. This resulted in a slightly crispy, slightly sweet coating that was absolutely delicious.          And because you can’t have chicken tenders without something to dip them in, I made this yummy sweet and spicy sauce to go with them. You can control the heat by adding more or less hot sauce.

255,"This Root Beer Barbecue Sauce is tangy and sweet and perfect for grilled or baked chicken, beef or pork.Even though we don’t own a grill, we love the flavor of barbecue. Bottled sauces never seem to quite cut it, but I’ve never found a completely homemade sauce that I love. So I like to doctor up the my favorite bottled sauces, like Sweet Baby Rays.For this Root Beer Barbecue Sauce, the regular or spicy bottled sauces work best. The sweet ones tend to just be too sweet combined with the soda. It’s super simple to bump up the bottled sauce a few notches by adding root beer, liquid smoke (one of my favorite ingredients!), garlic and a little soy sauce. It was sweet, sticky and smokey – all of my favorite barbecue sauce qualities! We like to cook our meat (in this case, babyback ribs and chicken thighs) in the pressure cooker (cooks quickly but still comes out super tender) and then top with the sauce and broil. If you’re grilling, I’d also recommend adding the sauce at the end to avoid burning. If baking in the oven, coat with sauce, bake, then coat with sauce again. Broiling for a few minutes will help caramelize the sugars and give you that nice sticky finish.This is the first (semi) homemade sauce that I’ve really enjoyed and I can’t wait to make again! My daughter, who is pretty picky about eating meat off of the bone (truth be told, so am I) absolutely loved this sauce with pork ribs. She’s not much into messy food either, so she made sure to keep her own package of Huggies® wipes right next to her so she could clean her hands and face after every few bites. Thankfully these wipes hold up to the mess each time and are gentle enough on her skin that she can use them over and over. (This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Huggies®. As always, all opinions are my own.)               I’m glad this little girl is finally branching out and trying this messy meat on a bone thing.

I especially like Greek Yogurt based dressings, too. The dressing for this Crispy Chicken Salad has both of those components, along with a tanginess that comes from rice vinegar and dijon mustard. This salad is similar to an Applebee’s Copycat Oriental Chicken Salad from Lil Luna that I came across a while back and have been really wanting to replicate.The salad itself is open for interpretation. I used what I had on hand, and it was amazing! I had some toasted Ramen noodles and almonds leftover from my Salmon Salad so I threw them in as well as some honey roasted peanut. I love a little crunch in my salad! I also added red cabbage, cucumbers, celery and green onions.Have you ever baked chicken tenders instead of frying them? They get super nice and crunchy. I usually pop them under the broiler too to get that nice golden color. So much healthier than frying! And when you’re eating a salad, you want things a little healthier, right? I don’t even brush them with oil or anything else, just a quick dredge in some flour, egg and breadcrumbs.My kids loved this salad and so did I – it will be making it into the monthly rotation for sure.For more salad recipes, try these:Teriyaki Chicken SaladFarmer’s Market Salad with Homemade RanchChicken Fajita Salad]Spinach and Watermelon SaladFor all salads go HERE, for all dinner recipes go HERE and for the recipe index go HERE.Hi!

Cover a large baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top (optional).Pat chicken tenders dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides.Set up an assembly line with the flour in one dish, the egg whisked with the milk in another, and the breadcrumbs in a third. Working with one wet hand and one dry hand, coat the chicken with the flour, then the egg and then the breadcrumbs, pressing them into the chicken to coat completely. Place on the foil or wire rack. Repeat with each chicken tender.Bake chicken at 400 degrees for about 10-12 minutes, or until no longer pink.

257,"This Slow Cooked Kalua Pork is a classic Hawaiian favorite made easily in your slow cooker with just a few ingredients. It’s succulent and smokey flavor will keep you coming back for more!If you’ve ever visited Hawaii, you’ve probably tried Kalua Pig (Pork). It’s on almost every menu. At counter service restaurants and food trucks you can get Kalua Pork as part of the Plate Lunch with two scoops of rice and Hawaiian Macaroni Salad.But what exactly is it? At luaus and family gatherings in Hawaii, it’s quite popular to roast an entire pig in the ground. Yes you read that right. A entire pig. A hole is dug and the pig is rubbed all over with Hawaiian Sea Salt, placed in the hole and covered with leaves or branches, like banana leaves that are lit on fire and then covered with dirt. The pig cooks in the ground for most of the day – at least 6-8 hours. The result is the most succulent and smokey meat.Of course you probably aren’t going to dig a hole in your own backyard to roast your own pig. All you need is a slow cooker, some sea salt (or kosher salt if that’s what you’ve got) and some Liquid Smoke. I use bone-in pork shoulder because I think you get even more flavor with the bone, but you could just as easily use boneless. The shoulder is a fatty meat, which adds to the flavor, but I think you could even use a pork loin. In the slow cooker, it’s going to get tender and juicy no matter what cut you use.Just rub salt and Liquid Smoke all over the meat. Then cover it and cook on low for 12 hours. Period. The end. That’s really all there is to it! Kalua Pork is excellent on it’s own, but we also like to stuff it inside a Hawaiian Roll or in a taco.

Where there used to be few options, like Caesar, Ranch or Italian, there are now so many salad options, you could eat a different way every day for a month and not get bored.This salad fits all of my requirements for the best salad. It’s got sweet strawberries, crunchy walnuts, tangy Feta, creamy avocado and a  slightly sweet Citrus & Herb Vinaigrette. Plus it’s topped with this ultra flavorful and juicy Citrus Chicken that I shared yesterday.But the Citrus Vinaigrette might be my very favorite part of this salad. It’s similar to the marinade for the chicken, with a few extras added in.

260,"This Tropical Chicken Pasta Salad is a fresh and light potluck dish or lunch for two. It’s got tons of chicken, pasta and tropical fruit.I’m always on the hunt for new lunch ideas. Since I work from home, it’s easy to fall into a peanut butter and jelly or cheese and crackers rut so I try to have lots of options always on hand. This includes having shredded chicken readily available. I’ll often cook up several chicken breasts to use throughout the week in my lunches.I also like to get creative with my lunches. I recently made a Lemon Chicken Pasta Salad that was amazing and this Tropical Chicken Pasta Salad was another. Greek Yogurt is my favorite thing to use in salads as well as toasted almonds. They were definitely a win for this salad as well!It’s got all of my favorite things – Pineapple and oranges, Greek yogurt, green onions, celery and almonds.

261,"This Citrus Grilled Chicken is marinated in a delicious combo of orange, lemon, lime and garlic. Throw it on the grill or sear it in a cast iron and finish in the oven. It’s perfect for a weeknight meal and it’s especially good in wraps and salads.Citrus flavors are my favorite flavors. Whether it’s in an appetizer, a main course or a dessert, it’s my go-to flavoring for just about everything. Especially chicken.Since boneless, skinless chicken breast can dry out pretty easily, marinating is always a good idea. It helps to infuse flavor and can keep the chicken juicy as it cooks. This particular marinade is super easy – just fresh lemon, lime and orange juices, garlic, canola oil and salt & pepper.We no longer have a grill; it broke and we just have never replaced it. So instead of outdoor grilling, I gave the chicken a hard sear to get that beautiful caramelization and then finished it in the oven. But I would definitely recommend grilling this chicken if you can.I was glad to have some leftovers of this amazing chicken because it topped this beautiful salad. The marinade was also the idea behind the Citrus Vinaigrette for the salad that I’ll share here tomorrow.You might also enjoy these chicken recipes:Lemon Chicken & Broccoli SkilletChicken & Asparagus Stir-FryCrispy Baked Barbecue Chicken BreastsOven Baked Barbecue Chicken TacosFor more chicken recipes, go HERE.For all main dish recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

262,"This Crunchy Ramen Noodle Salmon Salad is a unique, updated version of the potluck classic Ramen Noodle Salad. With toasted almonds and Ramen noodles, a sweet Asian style dressing and good-for-you baked salmon, this salad is sure to win over the potluck crowd!We’ve been eating healthier, and this has meant including salmon on our dinner menu at least once a week. I get bored with the same thing over and over; in fact I rarely make the exact same recipe twice! We all know that salmon is packed full of omega-3s and other healthy benefits, but the same baked salmon week after week was weighing on me.I decided I needed to come up with some alternative ways to enjoy this healthy fish. I created some Baked Salmon Teriyaki Lettuce Wraps that were absolutely to die for. I knew that salmon could be great in a salad, so I came up with this variation on the old stand-by potluck classic Asian style Ramen Noodle Salad.The base for the salad is a coleslaw mix; you could also chop your own cabbage and carrots. I added some red cabbage because that’s my favorite thing to have in salads. There’s also some fresh parsley and chopped green onions. The crunch come not only from the cabbage but from the toasted Ramen noodles and almonds. You could definitely toss them in the salad without toasting, but trust me when I say that toasting them brings out the most amazing flavor, and completely enhances the crunch.          The dressing is basically a sweet teriyaki-style dressing with soy sauce, Worcestershire, sugar, honey and vegetable oil. The salad is best when tossed together just as you are ready to serve. Dressing the salad too soon can make the noodles soft, and you really want that yummy crunch.

263,"This Hawaiian Baked Chicken is a version of the popular Huli-Huli Chicken. It’s sweet and savory and so delicious! Make it in the oven anytime, or grill it outdoors in the summer months.We were in Hawaii last week and I figured it would be the perfect time to start sharing some of my favorite Hawaiian-inspired recipes, like the Bacon & Pineapple Fried Rice I shared the other day.Chicken recipes have always been a huge hit around here, and I know this one will be no different. It’s pretty versatile – you can make it with bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks like I did, or use boneless, skinless chicken breasts to make it a little healthier. The marinade is a delicious combo of soy sauce, Worcestershire, honey, fresh ginger, pineapple juice, ketchup and garlic. Yum, right? The chicken is marinated for a couple of hours, or as long as overnight (the longer the better). The remaining marinade is cooked on the stove-top until it’s reduced into a sticky glaze to finish off the chicken. Heating the marinade and boiling it for at least 5 minutes kills any potential bacteria, however if you’re not comfortable with that, you could make a little extra and reserve it. I like reducing it to a thicker sauce on the stove.

Turn heat down to medium-low and continue cooking; whisking occasionally until sauce is reduced and thickened. It will continue to thicken as it sits.Bake chicken for 30-35 minutes, or until juices are clear and chicken is no longer pink near the bone.Turn chicken pieces over and baste with the cooked sauce about halfway through cooking time.Remove the pan from the oven and turn on the broiler.

264,"This Bacon & Pineapple Fried Rice is full of sweet pineapple and salty, crunchy bacon. It’s ready in less than 15 minutes and makes a delicious side dish or entree any day of the week.Fried Rice has always been a go-to easy dinner for us on busy weeknights. Any time I make rice as a side, I double it so I have leftovers for Fried Rice. I usually use any meat we have leftover, like chicken or pork or even smoked sausage, but sometimes I like to go a little crazy and fry up some bacon.Bacon Fried Rice was actually one of the very first recipes I ever cooked on my own as a kid. I remember finding the recipe in one of my mom’s cookbooks and wanting to make it. I made it all the time after that first trial and it became one of my all time favorite dishes.Fried Rice is now a favorite of my kids. I think sometime in the near future they’ll be ready to start making it on their own, too! It’s super simple, and you can customize it to your own personal tastes. The main ingredients for this Bacon & Pineapple Rice are onion, frozen vegetables (peas, carrots and corn), cooked white or brown rice, bacon, pineapple, garlic and soy sauce.                    The steps are easy – cook the bacon, and reserve a small amount of the fat to cook the onion in. You could also use canola or vegetable oil to make it a tiny bit healthier. Cook the onions and garlic, add the rice, then add the veggies. Once everything is heated through, stir in the bacon,  pineapple and green onion. Easy peasy and a great way to use up leftovers!Our favorite way to enjoy this Bacon & Pineapple Fried Rice is with this Huli-Huli Chicken.For more delicious entrees, try these:Slow Cooker Red Chile BeefGreen Chile Chicken Enchilada CasseroleTropical Chicken Pasta SaladParmesan Ranch Baked ChickenFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

265,"Tender pasta swimming in a silky, creamy, cheesy sauce. It’s so easy to make you’ll never go back to the blue box again!As long as I can remember Mac & Cheese has been one of my favorite dishes. It’s the ultimate comfort food. I mean, who can resist a good old fashioned combination of pasta and cheese? My aunt used to make this Mac & Cheese with tuna that I absolutely loved. It was literally Kraft Mac & Cheese and a can of tuna. But there was something about that was so delicious and homey.These days I still enjoy a helping of that blue box pasta but my taste buds are a little elevated and I prefer to make it from scratch. And seriously it’s so easy, why wouldn’t you? Some are a little frightened of the sauce; I sure was! But the steps are easy once you’ve made it a couple of times. Step 1 – Make a roux (melt butter and stir in flour, then cook). Step 2 – Make a bechamel (add warm milk or cream to the roux). Step 3 – Stir in the cheese (remove the pot from the heat and stir until completely melted). When you put it that way, it’s not so hard, right?The key is to getting the ratios right. 2 tablespoons of butter – 2 tablespoons of flour – 1 cup milk – 1 cup shredded cheese. That’s enough to make a cheese sauce for a half pound of pasta (half a box), which is plenty as a side dish. Now, if you like it a little creamier and cheesier, you can make more, but keep those ratios and you’ll be just fine! I typically will use sharp cheddar cheese, but if I’ve got other cheese on hand I’ll add Parmesan, Jack cheese or even Gouda. Again, keeping the ratios.For more delicious & easy dinner ideas, try these:Spaghetti & Meatball SoupRoasted Lemon Garlic ChickenOne Pan Chicken Apple Sausage PastaGarlic Parmesan TortelliniFor all entrees go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

266,"Baked Chicken Breasts are stuffed with savory Italian sausage and gooey Mozzarella cheese. It’s an easy weeknight meal that’s classy enough for company.When someone says to me, “This doesn’t seem like one of your easy recipes” while eating said easy recipe, I call that a win. This Italian Sausage Stuffed Baked Chicken is just that – a super easy meal that tasted super complicated.While it’s really easy to make, there are a few steps. The chicken breasts are first lightly pounded (this is essential to quick and evenly cooking chicken) and then butterfly cut. It’s easiest to do this with a sharp knife, making a slit through the center of the chicken lengthwise to form a sort of “pocket.” This is where you’re going to stuff all that cheesy, sausagey goodness.Once it’s stuffed you can secure the chicken with toothpicks or baker’s twine. Just be sure to remove ALL of them before serving, or you might here the dreaded “OW!” as your son takes a bite. Not that I’d know anything about that.I used our favorite jarred spaghetti sauce, but you could also make a basic Marinara like this one. Half of the sausage is stuffed in the chicken, while the other half is stirred into the sauce.The final step is to place the chicken into the skillet, cover it with the sauce and some more cheese, and bake for about half an hour.I served this baked chicken with a side of spaghetti and some sauteed broccoli. It’s a great way to change up Spaghetti Night! I made this all in one skillet, but if you don’t have an oven safe skillet you could cook the sausage and sauce, then layer everything in a baking dish. After plating the chicken, stir the sauce to incorporate all that cheese that’s left behind and serve over your favorite pasta. Want more easy baked chicken recipes?

Place seam side down in the skillet with the sauce. Pour remaining sauce over chicken and brush evenly. Sprinkle with basil, parsley and oregano, then top with remaining shredded Mozzarella.Stick a tooth pick into each breast (should stick out about an inch and a half so that the foil won't touch the cheese).

I have a recipe that is not only easy to make, it’s delicious. This Cucumber Hummus Sandwich is the perfect appetizer for a birthday party, baby shower or even a wedding shower. I hosted a book club tea party last week and these little sandwiches were a hit! My family and I love having picnics in the spring and summer so this recipe is a must.By using a Hummus spread already made it makes this dish super easy to make. You can find this at any supermarket. There are different flavors but I just went with the classic flavor. Grab a fresh cucumber from your garden or your local farmers market and get to slicing. I think fresh garden vegetables are the best. If you grow your own herbs grab some fresh dill to top it off. I don’t have an herb garden, so I just picked some up at the supermarket. You can also use the dill weed seasoning if you would prefer that.Don’t these look delicious?! So creamy and crunchy all in one bite! Yum! I used thin wheat bread slices.

You can play around with the flavors to come up with a profile that suits your fancy.I made this salad for myself and enjoyed it for lunch several times, but you could also double the recipe and take it to a potluck or barbecue.

269,"Chicken Alfredo Stuffed Shells are easy and so creamy and delicious. Stuffed with chicken, mozzarella, Parmesan and chicken and topped with a creamy homemade Alfredo sauce, these stuffed shells are perfect for a quick weeknight meal but still classy enough for company.My best friend and I have quite similar palates when it comes to food. We have been lunching together since we were in high school, and we have our favorite local and national restaurants. Don’t scoff, but Olive Garden is one of those places. I know some people swear that Olive Garden isn’t “real” Italian food, but if it tastes good, who cares?Since we have similar tastes, we tend to order the same food and drinks when we go out. At Olive Garden the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo is always one of those dishes. Tender pasta, creamy alfredo sauce and savory chicken…it’s definitely a winning combination and one that I enjoy replicating at home.As my family sat around the table enjoy these Stuffed Shells, I couldn’t help but wish for some Olive Garden salad and breadsticks to go with it!I’ve been wanting to try out these stuffed shells for a while now, but I wanted to do something that wasn’t the typical red sauce version. The stuffing is shredded chicken and four kinds of cheese – Ricotta, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Romano. The sauce is a simple Alfredo with only 3 ingredients – butter, heavy cream and Parmesan cheese. Stuff the shells, top them with the Alfredo and more cheese, and you’ll have a winning dish your family will be begging you to make again!Alfredo Sauce seems to be one of those sauces that people are scared of, but it couldn’t be easier to make. Melt some butter, cook some garlic, add some cream and melt some Parmesan. It’s literally as simple as that! The most traditional way to serve Alfredo sauce is over Fettuccine, but Chicken Alfredo is my favorite, no matter what kind of pasta you serve it on…or in! For the Stuffed Shells version, the sauce actually only goes on the bottom of the pan and then is spooned over the stuffed shells.Stuffing the shells for this Chicken Alfredo Stuffed Shells dish is pretty simple.

Drain water and lay on a flat surface to dry and cool.While the pasta shells are cooling, make the alfredo sauce and the chicken filling.Melt the butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add cream and bring to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and stir in the 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Set aside. Sauce will thicken as it stands.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

270,"Do you love grilling season? I’m pretty much bursting with excitement right now. We decided to make a pretty big purchase that will make this summer oh so delicious! I decided it was time to purchase a REAL grill for our family grill master! These Garlic and Lime Chicken Kabobs are the first of many grilled masterpieces to come!Kabobs are easy to put together and grill and they are fun to eat! I love that its something unique that you can present in a different way… not just your normal chicken with a side of veggies.Sometimes my kids like to have little competitions to see who can eat the most Garlic and Lime Chicken Kabobs! Which is totally cool with me because each kabob has a healthy dose of veggies… Yummy and healthy too!I paired my kabobs with some lettuce to make a delicious salad. I just smothered some more Garlic and Lime dressing over the top! But I can only imagine how delicious this meal would be with some grilled garlic toast… Oh yum! Next time I’m definitely doing that (when I’m no longer trying to win a health challenge).We love yummy and healthy dinners around here. Check out a few more of our summer favorites: Grilled Chicken Pesto Pasta – sounds yum, right?, Creamy Avocado Pasta is a delicious dish that can be prepped in 15 minutes with hardly any prep at all and is great with paired with grilled chicken and our long-time favorite Grilled Lemon Chicken and Zucchini Pasta!Feel free to come check out all of our fun ideas on Messes to Memories!For more dinner ideas, go HERE and for all recipes, go HERE.","Combine red wine vinegar, lime juice, salt, seasoning salt, chili powder, green onion, garlic and cream cheese in a blender. Slowly add oil. Once mixed, pulse to combine cilantro.Coat the chicken with 1/2 cup of the dressing and begin skewering the chicken and veggies to prep for grilling. Once you have a few prepped get them started on the grill. Rotate so that all the sides get cooked evenly. We really love that nice grill line! Mmmm.When you're ready to eat, drizzle a little more dressing on your kabobs. Serve with lettuce as a salad or in a sandwich or wrap!"
271,"This Chicken and Asparagus Stir Fry is super quick and easy, and super delicious. With big chunks of chicken and asparagus in a tangy sauce, this healthy recipe will quickly become a favorite for lunch or dinner.Being that it’s asparagus season, there’s always asparagus on sale. Sometimes I get a little greedy and grab 3 or 4 bunches…and then I have to figure out new ways to cook it! Of course it’s delicious on it’s own, or you could try this Balsamic Asparagus, or this Pesto Pasta Salad with Roasted Asparagus. Both are delicious, but my favorite preparation is a stir-fry. I like that the vegetables in a stir fry stay nice and crisp (there’s nothing worse than mushy vegetables).This stir-fry recipe is a spin off of a recipe I found on Skinny Taste. It had a whole bunch of ingredients in it that I didn’t have or didn’t want to use, so I narrowed it down to 5 ingredients, plus the chicken and asparagus – the sauce is simply soy sauce, lemon juice, honey and cornstarch. Plus it takes just about 20 or so minutes from start to finish, which is a total bonus in my book!

272,"This Smoked Sausage & Hash Brown Breakfast Casserole and perfect for your brunch menu and hearty enough to make for dinner.Breakfast casseroles are one of my favorite things, but I don’t make them all that often. I guess I always think of them taking time…like needing to be made the night before. I prefer to make the kind that don’t need to be made ahead of time – because I never think of it early enough!Smoked sausage is full of flavor, and the turkey kind is healthier for you than the regular one. We like this breakfast casserole topped with sour cream for a little extra oomph! It reminds me of a Hungarian dish my grandmother used to make, with sausage, bacon, potatoes, hard boiled eggs and sour cream.Prep for this dish is as easy as it gets. Cook up some onions and peppers with the sausage so they are nice and tender. Layer shredded hashbrown potatoes (the frozen kind that have been thawed is great), eggs + milk, cheese and sausage and peppers. That’s kinda it. Pretty easy, right?  I give it a little swirl at this point to make sure it’s all nice and coated, but you probably don’t have too. The great thing is you can make this ahead of time if you want, but you can also bake it right away.Another great thing? You can cut it up into squares and it freezes beautifully!

275,"This Lemon Chicken & Broccoli Skillet is a quick and easy meal, that can be prepared all in the same skillet in less than 30 minutes. It’s a healthy and delicious meal on its own or can be served with any of your favorite sides, from baked potato, to garlic bread or rice.One of my favorite go-to entrées is chicken breast. It’s healthy, it can stand up to tons of different flavors, and it’s prepared fairly quickly. One of my favorite ways to flavor chicken is with lemon. Lucky for me I have a huge lemon tree and I can get juicy lemons nearly year round. We picked a big laundry basket full last week, so I’ve been working on a few new recipes.This Lemon Chicken and Broccoli Skillet starts with seasoned chicken breasts (the boneless, skinless kind) that are pounded out to be uniform in thickness. This helps the chicken to cook more evenly and keeps the ends from drying out. The chicken is then seared in a little butter on each side for that golden brown color. You could substitute olive oil if butter’s not your thing. But really, how could butter not be your thing?Once the chicken is browned on both sides, you’ll add a little lemon juice and chicken broth to the skillet, and finally the broccoli. It will all cook together in the oven, and the cooking time will vary depending on how thick your chicken is. But since it’s browned in the skillet, it doesn’t take too long. Mine took about 9 minutes, and on average it will take 8-10.When serving, spoon of little of the cooking liquid from the skillet over the chicken. If you’re feeling frisky, you can make a creamy sauce with all that browned goodness in the skillet. Just add a little butter and heavy cream and heat through until you’re happy with the consistency and flavor.Fore more quick and easy one skillet recipes, try these:Roasted Lemon Garlic ChickenOven Baked Barbecue Chicken TacosTender & Juicy Baked Chicken BreastsCheesy One Pan Chicken and RiceFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

Cook for about 4 minutes on one side; until chicken is golden brown. Flip chicken and sear for 2 minutes on the other side.Turn off heat and gently pour lemon/chicken broth mixture around the chicken (not over it). Arrange broccoli pieces around the chicken in the skillet and set in the oven for 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through (165-175 degrees; it will feel firm and the juices will run clear when pierced with a knife).Serve hot, spooning the sauce from the skillet over each piece as it's plated, if desired."

Change up Taco Tuesday or make them for Cinco de Mayo!I love getting fajitas in a Mexican restaurant. It’s always so exciting when they bring that steaming cast iron plate to the table with sizzling chicken or steak and tender peppers and onions. Then all that goodness is wrapped in a house-made tortilla and although they’re likely too hot to eat right away you willingly shovel them in your mouth because they are just THAT good.Wouldn’t it be nice if they delivered that same sizzling plate of awesomeness to your dinner table at home?These Slow Cooker Chicken Fajitas may not arrive on a sizzling cast iron plate, but let me tell you, they are just as delicious! Plump, juicy chicken breast is cut into strips and then seasoned with a delicious blend of spices. They sit on top of the sliced bell peppers and onions, and cook for a few hours, making the chicken and the vegetable super tender.If you’re feeling fancy, you can make your own tortillas (here’s a great recipe) but you can buy them at the grocery store and they are almost as good.

279,"Barbecue Ranch Cheddar Baked Chicken is the perfect weeknight meal to satisfy your hungry family. It’s easy, delicious, and is ready in less than 30 minutes!When it comes to feeding my family, chicken recipes are my go-to. Chicken is pretty easy to work with and there are so many different ways to prepare it. This particular recipe is a take on my Ranch Parmesan Baked Chicken, and uses the same method.Hidden Valley has recently come out with a new line of salad dressings. Since Hidden Valley has always been our go-to Ranch Dressing, I was excited to try them out. There are four new flavors from Hidden Valley Ranch now available at Walmart, including Ranch Honey BBQ, Ranch Buffalo, Ranch Sriracha, and Ranch Cilantro Lime. The Hidden Valley Ranch Honey BBQ is definitely in the running for our new favorite. It’s delicious in chicken wraps, on salads, and on this Barbecue Ranch Cheddar Baked Chicken. Love that Walmart makes it easy to pick up everything I need for any of these delicious meals.If you’d like to try these new Hidden Valley Ranch Dressings for yourself, here’s a handy coupon for you: Walmart/Hidden Valley Coupon.Now to make the chicken, start by pounding out the chicken breasts. This is so important because you want them to be even thickness so they will stay juicy and not dry out. Season them with garlic salt and chili powder, then brush on the Hidden Valley Ranch Honey BBQ Dressing. Finally crush us some cheese crackers (like Cheese-Its or Cheese Nips) and combine them with some shredded Cheddar cheese. Press that mixture into the chicken. The crackers and cheese will form a delicious crust on the chicken, and the dressing helps to keep the chicken super juicy and tender.I like to top the chicken with some parsley for color, but it’s a completely optional step. See how golden brown it gets? So yummy!Serve it with some of the Ranch Honey BBQ dressing on the side for dipping.For more easy chicken dinner recipes, try these: Parmesan Ranch Baked ChickenBaked Barbecue ChickenRoasted Lemon Garlic ChickenFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.This is a sponsored conversation written by me on behalf of Hidden Valley Ranch.

281,"This Slow Cooker Red Chile Beef is a hearty, rich and flavorful meal. It’s a delicious Mexican recipe that the whole family will love!About 12 years ago I was visiting family in Arizona and my cousin made this amazing Red Chile Beef. She served it with Mexican Rice, green cabbage and lots of lime squeezed on top. It was by far one of the most amazing things I’ve ever eaten. The beef simmered slowly on the stove for hours, giving such a rich flavor.Several years back I was craving that amazing meal so I called my cousin and asked her how to make it. She had no clue what I was talking about. I explained the steps (what I could remember) and how it was served, and still, nothing. I was starting to feel like maybe I’d imagined the whole thing! Then her daughter came to visit last December and I asked her about and right away she called her mom saying, “How could you not know what she was talking about?!” Needless to say I now have the recipe, and I’m sharing it here with you!This is a fairly simple recipe, but it does take some time to prepare. Most of that is just cooking time, so you’re not tied to the stove. Red Chile Beef starts with, of course, red chiles! You can find the dehydrated chiles (like these) at most grocery stores. They are boiled in a small post on the stove to re-hydrate them in order to make the sauce.The sauce can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for a day or two. Be careful with these – they aren’t incredibly spicy, but they do stain. I do not recommend wearing white leggings while making this sauce. (That sounded pretty specific, right? You should see my poor leggings). You can use a food processor or blender to mix the sauce. I used a food processor but I actually would recommend a blender to get a smoother consistency.The beef itself can be stew meat, or a roast, like a round roast or even tri tip. Chuck would work as well, but it’s got a little too much fat. The meat is cut into large or small chunks, browned in a little olive oil then added to the slow cooker and coated with sauce.It then cooks on low for about 6-8 hours. Slow cooker temperatures can vary, so I recommend checking every hour after the 6th hour. When the meat falls apart easily, it’s ready.Red Chile Beef is typically served over/with Mexican Rice, but I actually like it with just white rice. We serve it with a little green cabbage on top for some texture and crunch. And of course, several squeezes of lime juice. We like key limes, but regular limes are fine too.Fore more delicious Mexican dishes, try these:Slow Cooker Mexican BeansMexican RiceSlow Cooker Carnitas10 Minute TostadasFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

Use a fork or spatula to gently flip peppers a few times so they cook evenly.Remove stems from the cooked peppers. Place peppers, garlic, onion, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and about 1 cup of cooking liquid into a blender (recommended) or food processor. Blend until completely smooth. Taste and add more salt if needed.Sauce can be used immediately or refrigerated for up to 2 days.Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. If using a large roast, cut into 4-5 pieces. Season with a little salt and pepper and place in the skillet, browning on each side; about 2 minutes per side.Place meat in the slow cooker. Pour sauce over the meat and stir to coat completely.Cook on low for 6-8 hours.

282,"Easy and delicious and ready in just about 30 minutes, these Homemade Parmesan Meatballs are the start of a great weeknight meal.It’s amusing to me how many ways there are to make the “perfect” meatball. I have three or four different meatball recipes on this site. It seems though, that each recipe is better than the last, or at least that’s how my children seem to feel. Even my practically vegan daughter offered up a “these are pretty good,” at first bite.Meatballs are one of those super comforting, tastes complicated but are really easy to make kind of foods. This recipe has only 6 simple main ingredients – ground beef, garlic, breadcrumbs, spaghetti sauce (the jarred kind – or you can use my easy marinara recipe), cheese and Italian seasoning. Ok, 7 if you count that there are 2 kinds of cheese.The meat is gently mixed with your hands then formed into balls. You can bake them on a separate sheet pan, or bake them right in the skillet like I did to make this a truly one pan dish.Cover the skillet with foil, and place meatballs in an even layer, close together but not touching. Bake them for about 12-14 minutes. Once they come out of the oven you’ll want to carefully lift one one corner of the foil and move the meatballs from the foil to the pan, while pulling up the foil on each side to keep the juices inside. If this makes you nervous, use a rimmed, foil-covered sheet pan for baking, then transfer the meatballs to the skillet. Using tongs, fold up the foil completely and let cool on a paper plate before tossing in the trash.                    Finally add some sauce and cheese to the pan. I used a little over a cup because my kids aren’t huge fans of the sauce lately…but for a saucier dish, use 2 cups or even more of the sauce.

283,"This Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Casserole is creamy, cheesy and flavorful. It’s an easy recipe that’s perfect for feeding your family on busy weeknights.Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas are one of my all-time favorite recipes. Funny thing is, I’ve shared two different versions on the blog, One Pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Pasta and Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Nachos, but never the actual casserole! My cousin was visiting last week and was able to help me crank out 4 batches of this delicious casserole (this is her recipe after all). It’s an easy make-ahead dish, and it also freezes beautifully. We put one in the fridge to bake the next day, and put the rest in the freezer.While we were putting the casseroles together, she shared her shortcut tips for making it a little quicker.1. Use store-bought Rotisserie Chicken. Not only is it more flavorful, it’s a huge time saver.2. Use a mixer to not only shred the chicken, but to blend with the sour cream, cream cheese and green chiles.3. Use whipped cream cheese instead of the block. Not a money saver, but will save the step of having to bring the cream cheese to room temperature.4. When layering the ingredients, don’t worry about spreading the chicken mixture. Just plop several spoonfuls down and let the next layer of tortillas spread the mixture as you press down.                    5. For a cheesier casserole, add a layer of just cheese and sauce. Top with more tortillas and then repeat the meat mixture.6. Don’t forget the olives. Now, you can definitely make this casserole without them if you like, but they do add a nice saltiness and texture to this already amazing Chicken Enchilada Casserole.7. Finally, don’t get too hung up on the ingredients. This is actually something that I often practice in my kitchen. Some recipes, especially in baking, it’s important to follow a recipe to a “T.” Things like casseroles however, it’s not as critical. For instance, if you like saucier enchiladas, add more sauce, or less if you prefer it more dry. Experiment with different kinds of cheeses. We used Colby Jack in the photos because that’s what I had in the fridge. But it’s also good with Cheddar Jack, or just Jack. There are different kinds of enchilada sauce, too, from mild to hot. Don’t be afraid to play around with the recipe!For more delicious Mexican recipes, try these:One Pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada PastaAuthentic Mexican RiceRefried BeansSlow Cooker CarnitasFor all main course recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

Layer with tortillas, breaking to fit as necessary to form a single layer. Spoon a third of the chicken mixture over the tortillas, then a third of the shredded cheese and a third of the remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat with two more layers, finishing with a layer of tortillas, then sauce, then cheese. Top with sliced olives, if desired.Cover baking dish with nonstick foil. If you don't have nonstick foil, stick several toothpicks into the casserole to keep the foil from touching the cheese. Bake, covered, for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove foil and bake 10 minutes more, or until cheese is completely melted."
284,"Tender, juicy chicken is topped with Ranch dressing, buttery crackers, and savory Parmesan cheese. This is a baked chicken dish your entire family will be begging for! This is an update to a post from 2013. Find the original post here.When I first made this Parmesan Ranch Baked Chicken recipe a couple of years ago, I wasn’t planning on posting it because I didn’t know how it would turn out. But after posting a quick pic I snapped with my phone on Instagram, lots of people wanted the recipe. So I went ahead and posted it with that crummy iPhone photo, figuring I’d make it again and get some better shots. That was two and a half years ago and that crummy photo has been pinned nearly 300,000 times!My daughter loved this the first time I made it, but my son wasn’t as convinced. In fact, he hated it. This time around however, he must have a more evolved palate because he LOVED it. After he gobbled it down I reminded him that he hated it the first time I’d made it. His response? “I’m in second grade now so my tastebuds have changed.” Touché.I decided to shoot some images while I was putting the chicken together to give you an idea of just how easy it is. Start by pounding the chicken out so the breasts are equal in thickness throughout. This helps tremendously in the cooking process and prevents drying. You can use a meat tenderizer with a flat side like I do, of just use a flat bottomed skillet. I cut my pieces in half since none of us would eat a whole chicken breast (these were pretty big). Then sprinkle with some garlic salt for flavor and brush some Ranch dressing directly on top.Next grate some Parmesan cheese and crush some Ritz crackers in a food processor ( I love my Kitchen Aid). You could also simply grate the cheese and crush the crackers by hand. Sprinkle that cheesy buttery goodness all over the chicken and press to help it adhere.The final step is baking the chicken, It takes about 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven. If the top isn’t browned enough for you, flip on the broiler after 20 minutes and leave it for 1-2 minutes to get it nice and golden.Doesn’t that look delicious. I love what Chef Anne Berell says – “Brown food tastes good!” It’s definitely true here. This chicken is tender and juicy, and the topping is slightly crunchy. I’ve seen a lot of recipes for Parmesan Ranch Chicken, but they all call for dry Ranch seasoning, which is super salty and really gives an overpowering Ranch flavor. Which is fine if that’s what you’re after, but I prefer a subtle Ranch flavor taking a backseat and letting the Parmesan be the star.

If additional browning time is needed, place chicken under the broiler for a couple minutes.Serve hot."
285,"Arizona Chicken Corn Chowder is a creamy, slightly spicy soup with crunchy kernels of corn throughout. It’s a rich and filling meal the whole family will enjoy.      My cousin is one of my favorite cooks. She’s taught me all kinds of unique (mostly Mexican) recipes. When her daughter came to visit us over Christmas break a couple of months ago, she brought several of her mama’s homecooked meals. This Arizona Chicken Corn Chowder was one of them. I’ve also seen it called “Southwest” or “Tex-Mex,” but they’re from Arizona, so we’re sticking with that.      She is the first to tell you that she doesn’t follow a recipe when she cooks, and it’s difficult to get her to nail down specifics because each time is different! This particular recipe she has perfected in a way that her family (including me!) really loves, and that’s the recipe I’ve got to share with you today.      There aren’t a ton of strange ingredients – it’s pretty straightforward. Shredded chicken (cook your own or use store bought rotisserie to save time and add flavor), cream cheese, Pace Picante Sauce (broken down in the blender or food processor to make it smooth), chicken broth and frozen corn. There are a couple of spices you can add, but that’s pretty much it! And holy cow is it a big giant pot of creamy deliciousness!

286,"This Creamy Chicken Salad has tons of fresh ingredients, like apples, grapes, celery and green onions. Toasted almonds give a nice crunch, and the creamy Greek Yogurt dressing is sweet and tangy. It’s a healthy, light and fresh meal for lunch or dinner!I’ve always been a sucker for a good salad, and this creamy chicken salad sure hits the spot. It can be served up lots of different ways, from lettuce wraps to tortillas wraps to sandwiches, and it’s delicious just on it’s own.The dressing is sweet and creamy, with a bit of tang from the lemon juice. The best part about this salad is that you can customize it to your own taste. The recipe is merely a guideline…don’t like Greek Yogurt? Use all sour cream. Want to keep it healthier, leave out the mayo and sour cream and just use all Greek Yogurt. You could add a little balsamic or apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, and if you don’t want the sweetness, leave out the honey. The key is to kind of taste as you go, so you can decide on just the right level of sweetness or acidity.The same goes for the salad itself. If almonds aren’t your thing, you could swap them out for walnuts or pecans. Experiment with different kinds of fruit, like strawberries or melon. To make the chicken, I usually just boil it on the stovetop, but use any leftover chicken you might have, or even rotisserie chicken.For more healthy meal ideas, try these:Tropical Chicken Slaw with Creamy Pineapple DressingTurkey, Kale and Rice SoupOrange & Balsamic Chicken Lettuce WrapsChicken Fajita SaladFor all salads go HERE, for all entrees go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

289,"This Teriyaki Chicken Salad is my take on Red Robin’s Banzai Salad. It’s got sweet teriyaki chicken and mandarin oranges, toasted almonds, edamame and a creamy honey mustard dressing.      I’m not ashamed to say that we eat out at Red Robin probably 3 times a month, maybe more if you count the occasional lunch. It’s close, it’s reasonable and it has food that we all love (those fries though, mmm!). Last summer they introduced some new menu items and I hesitantly tried the Banzai Chicken Salad. It’s got grilled teriyaki chicken, and a sweet and tangy honey mustard dressing.      Never in a million years did I think I would fall in love with this chicken salad, but holy smokes! It quickly became my favorite. A few weeks ago I decided that I needed to come up with a recipe at home so I could have it more than 3 times a month!I searched for a copycat of their honey mustard dressing, and combined a few recipes to come up with one I really liked. I added edamame to my salad for some extra protein and crunch, and topped it with toasted sesame seeds and almonds.      The teriyaki sauce is sweet and sticky and gives a nice smoky flavor to the chicken, while the oranges provide a soft and sweet element. The toasted almonds and sesame seeds give a great texture and the honey mustard dressing is just the right combination of creamy, sweet and tangy. Perfection!      Love Chicken Salad?

290,"These sweet and slightly spicy Honey Glazed Crispy Baked Chicken Wings are baked in the oven to crisp perfection, then smothered in a delicious glaze of honey, soy sauce and spices. Then they are broiled to give that extra sticky finish. Thanks to Huggies® Wipes for sponsoring today’s discussion.Baked Chicken Wings are the ultimate finger food. They can be smothered in sticky sauces, like this honey glaze, or rubbed with spices and baked to perfection. There’s something that’s just fun about eating with your hands, it can make adults feel like kids again, and it makes kids feel like, well, kids! Plus my kids can easily help out with this recipe, dipping the chicken in the flour, and they love using that sticky glaze to coat the wings.Only problem with these types of wings, they are M-E-S-S-Y. Which is why I always keep Huggies® Wipes on hand. Baby Wipes, you say? Yup! I use these bad boys for everything from cleaning up sticky hands and dirty faces, to taking off my make-up. Since they come in various sizes, I’m able to keep them in my car, and I never forget them when I travel, because Huggies® knows that Kids Outgrow Diapers, Not Messes™. Only Huggies® Wipes have TripleClean* layers that are gentle on skin and thick enough to clean the mess, and they don’t tear when you use them!Kids get messy, that’s just a fact. My kids however, seem to be messier than the average! I’ve had to really stretch myself as a parent to be able to watch my kids dig in the dirt and play with bugs and basically just get down and dirty on a daily basis. It’s just one of those things you have to learn to accept and enjoy. Some days I just laugh and sometimes I find myself wishing they would grow out of it. But I have to remind myself that this is a phase – they won’t be messy like this forever and I’m sure there will be a day down the road when I’m picturing that dirty little face as she walks out the door to her high school prom.In the meantime, I let them get messy. Which brings us back to these baked chicken wings. They are among my kid’s favorite things to eat (hello, messy kid alert!) and I personally have quite an affinity for them myself. I tried to create a sauce that was similar to PF Changs Honey Chicken, which they both love, and I think this glaze comes pretty close. The chicken recipe itself is similar to other baked chicken wings recipes I’ve shared.Be sure to visit Huggies.com for valuable coupons, and join the Huggies® social media sweepstakes by posting an image to Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #HugTheMessSweepstakes.For more messy snacks, try these:Crispy Baked Barbecue Chicken WingsS’Mores Oreo BrowniesSpicy Cranberry Barbecue MeatballsFor all appetizers go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

291,"This Asian Style Hot and Sour Potsticker Soup is a delicious and hearty soup full of rich flavor. It’s sure to warm your belly on a cold night and it’s a delicious way to celebrate Chinese New Year.      I love recipes that are delicious and taste like they’ve been cooking for hours. I also love shortcuts. This Potsticker Soup has a deliciously savory, spicy and tangy base along with lots of fresh ingredients. But the best part is the potstickers are Tai Pei brand frozen Potstickers, and they cook right in the soup! I’ve tried a few different brands, but these are by far my favorite.      There are chicken and pork flavored Potstickers from Tai Pei, and you could use either flavor for this soup. There are also lots of fresh ingredients, like baby kale, spinach, green onions, carrots and celery.      The spice comes from Red Pepper Flakes, mostly because that’s what I always have in my pantry. But you could also spice it up with some Sriracha or Thai chili paste. Instead of plain soy sauce, I added a little of the sauce that comes with the Potstickers. It added a sweet note, and a whole other layer of flavor. To finish it off you could add cilantro or chopped parsley.      For my kids I leave out the red pepper flakes since they don’t like the heat. We enjoyed this soup on Chinese New Year this past week. There are so many different ways to introduce different cultures, but I think one of the easiest ways is through food. Tai Pei makes it easy with lots of ready made options, like these Potstickers, and other entrees like Fried Rice and Orange Chicken.Tai Pei offers authentic Asian style appetizers that are ready in just minutes, and they are loaded with traditional style and flavor.      Sure my kids learn about other cultures in school, in fact they even had a TET celebration assembly. But it’s so important to continue that conversation at home. Learning about other races and cultures enhances what they learn at school, but it also give an opportunity for discussing what makes us different and celebrating those differences rather than making fun, which kids tend to do. Plus Chinese New Year celebrates the wish of “Good Fortune,” and who couldn’t use a little more of that?I hope you’ll give this Potsticker Soup a try!

We are planning to take a surprise trip to Hawaii this May. This will be my fourth trip to Hawaii, and my kids’ second. We are staying at Disney’s Aulani Resort again, and I am beyond excited to surprise them with it! We’ve been having a ton of rain here in Southern California lately (thank you El Nino), and the cold and wet weather has had me yearning the tropical flavors of the islands.      This Crunchy Tropical Chicken Slaw recipe feeds that craving. You can make a lot and feed a crowd, or make just enough for a delicious, healthy lunch or dinner.This salad couldn’t be easier to make. I used cooked, shredded chicken that I almost always have on hand (rotisserie chicken works great, too) and I cut my own cabbage and carrots for the slaw mix. I feel like it’s just tastes so much fresher than buying a pre-made mix. Plus it’s beyond easy in my Kitchen Aid Food Processor.      The dressing is just as simple, with rice vinegar, pineapple juice, olive oil, soy sauce, honey and Greek yogurt. I will typically make a dressing like this in a mason jar and just shake it up and pour it over the salad. You could also whisk it together or process in a blender.My very favorite part of this Tropical Chicken Slaw is the toasted almonds and sesame seeds. They add a nice crunch and texture, and give the slaw a slightly smoky flavor.

299,"This Turkey, Kale and Rice Soup is a hearty soup that’s full of flavor, and it’s good for you too!      The only time I’ve ever eaten Kale is in that creamy, not so good for you soup from Olive Garden. And I loved it. However, something about it being considered a “super food” must have scared me away. I mean, there’s such a thing as too healthy, right? Ok, maybe not, but either way, I wasn’t willing to try it in anything else. Well that’s not true. I tried it raw in a salad and thought I was going to die.      Anyway…there was a sale on ground turkey a couple of weeks ago, so I stocked up. I knew that I wanted to make soup with it, but I couldn’t decide on a recipe. I came across this recipe from Giada De Laurentiis and thought it sounded pretty tasty. Tasty enough to give kale a try again.      My recipe is an adapted version, based on our preferences and what I hand on hand. This Turkey, Kale and Rice Soup is super simple to make, and starts with a basic soup base of onions, carrots and celery. Next the ground turkey is browned, seasonings are added, and finally chicken broth, white rice and canned tomatoes. The final touch is of course the kale.      This delicious soup is rich and hearty, and is the perfect comfort food for when you’re trying to eat more on the healthy side, and it’s a great way to get my kids to eat their vegetables. My son slurped up every drop of the two bowlfuls he ate. That spells success in my book!

301,"Spaghetti and Meatballs is a classic family meal that everyone can enjoy. But it can get boring after a while! Try this Spaghetti and Meatball Soup – it’s sure to spice up boring old spaghetti night!      If there’s one thing I know I can always get my kids to eat, it’s soup. In soup, they’l (almost) always eat the vegetables. This Spaghetti and Meatball Soup is no exception.      It’s fun, it’s savory and it’s perfect comfort food. The broth is basically spaghetti sauce and beef broth, with some added seasonings to amp up the flavor. I made a huge batch of homemade meatballs the other day and they were delicious in this soup. Of course you can also use store bought meatballs if you prefer, to make it even easier.You can use traditional spaghetti noodles (I did cut them up before serving to make it easier), or any kind of small pasta, like rotini, or even those little wagon wheels that kids love. The key with any kind of soup that calls for pasta it to cook the pasta separately, NOT in the soup, and add it to the soup just before serving. If it cooks in the soup, it tends to get a little mushy, and no one wants mushy pasta!

Nachos are the perfect way to spice up your game day snacks – it’s easy to whip up a lot, you can eat them with your fingers, and they taste delicious.      After a fun day of shopping and lunch with a good friend the other day, I stopped at my local Vons grocery to pick up the ingredients for these Chicken Enchilada Nachos that I’d been dying to make, starting with Old El Paso Green Chile Enchilada Sauce. I also grabbed chicken, tortilla strips, salsa, diced green chiles, cheddar and jack cheeses, sliced olives, sour cream and cream cheese. Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas are one of my favorite meals, and I knew Nachos would be a fun way to turn them into a finger food that my kids would love.First I cooked up the chicken, then shredded it and added Old El Paso Green Chile Enchilada Sauce. Yum! The flavor is nice and mild but still very tasty.      Next I topped some tortilla strips with cheddar and jack cheese and melted them in the broiler.            Once the cheese was nice and melted, I topped the chips with the shredded chicken and drizzled on some more enchilada sauce. Then added salsa, diced green chiles and sliced olives. Finally I topped it with more cheese, because you just can’t have too much cheese!                  I put the pan in the oven again to melt the cheese and heat the other toppings. What I love most about my Green Chile Enchilada recipe is how creamy they are. So for the last step I combined softened cream cheese with sour cream and drizzled it all over the nachos!Not only are they super kid friendly, but Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Nachos would be a great snack for your game day party!

310,"Hi Everyone! It’s Jennifer from Town and Country Living with an easy, old fashioned pot roast recipe. When I was growing up, every Sunday was the same at our house. Mom would drag us kids out of bed to get ready for Sunday School and Church. We were at church for almost 3 hours and would get home between 12 and 1 o’clock. That didn’t leave much time for my mother to get lunch ready for 7 hungry people. More often than not, she would make my grandmother’s old fashioned pot roast.      Mom could prepare the pot roast in the morning before church, and then leave it to simmer while we were gone. By the time we got back home, all she’d have to do is take it out of the dutch oven and serve it up.      A benefit to this recipe is you only use one pot – a dutch oven. Peel and cut your potatoes, carrots and onions. Over medium high heat, brown the vegetables in a couple tablespoons olive oil. Next, you sear your pot roast on both sides until browned.      Deglaze the pan with wine or water, and then return the roast to the pan. Add about 4 cups of beef broth, then add the vegetables and spices. Place the lid on the dutch oven and roast in a 275 degree oven for 3 to 4 hours.      The carrots and potatoes have a wonderful beefy flavor when you take them out of the pan. You can serve the meat au jus or create a gravy from the drippings. As a kid, I preferred au jus over gravy.      Mom would slice the roast and serve it up. I would pour the juice over both the meat and vegetables.  My brother ate his with ketchup. Such a flavorful meal without spending a lot of time in the kitchen. I can see why my mother served this almost every Sunday!You Might Also Enjoy …      My new blog … Blonde on Wine!

On high heat, sear the pot roast on both sides for a minute or two.Remove the beef from pan. Slowly add 1 cup dry red wine to deglaze the pan. Add the meat back to the dutch oven and place the vegetables around the edges of the meat. Pour 4 cups of beef broth to the pan so meat is halfway immersed.Place lid on dutch oven and cook in 275 degree oven for 3 to 4 hours. Remove from oven and let meat set for a few minutes before slicing and serving."
311,"Hi Everyone!  It’s Jennifer from Town and Country Living here to share another yummy recipe with you. Although I’m a vegetarian, I’m always on the hunt for meat dishes that my hubby will love. Casseroles are always a great choice for him because he can eat leftovers for lunch at work.      I would definitely list this casserole as comfort food since it’s infused with a wonderful bechamel sauce. Two cheeses are used … fresh mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano cheese. Be forewarned; parmigiano-reggiano is an expensive cheese but it’s worth every penny!      One time I sent my hubby to the grocery store for some parmigiano-reggiano cheese and told him not to look at the price … just bring me the cheese!  For whatever reason, after seeing the price tag he decided Parmesan cheese would do the trick. Wrong! Don’t make the same mistake he did. The right cheese does make a difference!      I found the recipe for Baked Ham and Cheese Rice Casserole in the Every Night Italian cookbook. I found this treasure at the Good Will store for just $2. I love it because most of the recipes are easy, yet tasty.      Baked Ham and Cheese Rice Casserole passed the hubby’s taste test!

Melt 4 tablespoons in heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk until smooth. Add hot milk a few tablespoons at a time, whisking until mixture is smooth before adding more milk. Keep adding milk gradually until all milk is added. Sauce will be thin but will thicken the longer it cooks.

Salt and pepper to taste.Spray casserole dish with cooking spray. Spread half of rice mixture in bottom of casserole. Sprinkle layer with mozzarella cheese, and then spread remaining half of rice mixture over the cheese. Carefully pour remaining bechamel sauce over the top and spread evenly.

313,"These stuffed biscuits are a new take on traditional biscuits and gravy. Tender, flaky biscuits are stuffed full of savory pork sausage and creamy, melty cheddar cheese then smothered in gravy. What more could you ask for in a breakfast?      I needed to come up with a quick dinner the other day, but we were a little low on supplies. In fact, I had been putting off grocery shopping for, oh, maybe a week. Needless to say the cupboards were somewhat bare so I gave myself a little chopped style challenge to come up with a quick and easy meal using the country pork sausage in my fridge that had about a day left until it’s expiration. This is what I came up with.      I grabbed the can of Grands Flaky Biscuits, some white cheddar cheese and the pork sausage. I cooked the sausage and grated the cheese then stuffed both inside each biscuit before baking them. While they baked I used the 10 minutes to whip up some quick sausage gravy in the pan.      Much to my surprise the meal was delicious, served with some scrambled eggs and fresh fruit. My kids both ate almost two full biscuits and loved dipping them in the gravy. This is definitely comfort food at it’s finest and would be great for serving up to guests at your next brunch!

Drain sausage on a paper towel lined plate and let cool while you grate the cheese. (set the pan aside for the gravy and do not wipe clean).In a medium sized bowl, gently toss sausage and cheese together until combined. You don't want the cheese to melt. Open the package of biscuits and divide into the 8 pieces. Split the layers and stuff with a heaping tablespoon of the sausage and cheese mixture. Close the biscuit and seal the edges with your fingers. Place biscuits onto a baking sheet 1-2 inches apart.Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.While the biscuits are cooking, prepare the gravy.Heat the pan with the sausage drippings over medium heat. You need about 2 tablespoons of fat, so if there isn't quite enough, add a tablespoon of butter. When butter is melted, add 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour. Whisk together fat and flour until it's well combined, then cook, whisking often until golden in color. Slowly whisk in about the milk. Bring to a low boil and cook until mixture starts to thicken. If gravy is too thick, add a little more milk. Add salt and pepper to taste.Serve stuffed biscuits hot with gravy on the side for dipping."

My kids will literally jump for joy when I make it. This Tex-Mex version is a play off of Pioneer Woman’s recipe and I wasn’t sure if they would like it, but even my pickiest had two servings. My mom, who happened to be joining us, doesn’t like bell peppers but loved them in this dish. This skillet meal is definitely a crowd pleaser!I opted to use ready cooked rice that I grabbed at the grocery store so I didn’t have to cook any. However when planning to make something like this I would usually use leftover rice. Either one would work, or you could cook some just for this dish if you don’t mind dirtying another pan.I topped the rice with fresh parsley and lime juice. If you’re a fan of cilantro I imagine it would be great – I just happen to be one of those people who can’t stand the stuff. The lime juice is a must though; it offers a burst of brightness and freshness that perfectly rounds out the dish.For more delicious one skillet meals, try these:Skillet Chili and CornbreadSkillet LasagnaSmoked Sausage and Zucchini SkilletFor all One Pan Meals go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

316,"These Lasagna Roll-Ups are great for picky eaters because they are full of flavor, and lots of cheese. What they’ll never know (unless you tell) is that they are chock full of veggies too!      So the other day I really wanted to make a veggie lasagna. I had zucchini, yellow squash and spinach, and I knew it would taste amazing. However, I knew there was no way my little munchkins would eat any of it if they saw those big chunks of veggies. So I knew I needed to “hide” them. And hide them I did.I used a fine grater and spent some time grating the squash down. I squeezed out as much liquid as possible and then added it to my homemade meat sauce.      That’s nearly two cup of veggies! Once the sauce was bubbling I added a few handfuls of chopped spinach. Because, why not?      I let it cook and reduce down a bit. All of those veggies have quite of bit of water in them, so the reducing step is important to thicken up the sauce and keep it from being too watery.      See? You can’t even see the squash! And the spinach leaves fit in and look like herbs so no one is the wiser.Next comes the fun part. I cooked some regular lasagna noodles until they were about three-quarters of the way finished. You want them to still have a bite because they will continue to cook as the lasagna roll-ups bake.The roll-ups are layered just like a regular lasagna casserole; in fact you could make this a casserole instead if you so desired. Layer the cheese mixture, which is Ricotta cheese, Parmesan, mozzarella and parsley. Then spread the sauce on top and roll, placing them seam side down in the pan.                  This is incredibly easy, though it sounds more complicated than it looks. Spread more sauce on top and a whole bunch of cheese and bake until bubbly. Serve immediately and watch those happy smiles beg for seconds!      inspired by Cooking Classy.For more great pasta dishes, try these:Chicken Stuffed ManicottiTortellini and Tomato Soup with Italian SausageRoasted Red Pepper Fettuccine AlfredoEasy Weeknight Pasta with Meat SauceFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.

317,"This quick and easy pasta is a perfect light meal for when you really don’t feel like cooking – it takes just minutes to make and is bursting with flavor!      Similar to my Tomato, Bacon & Asparagus Pasta, this recipe has a simple sauce that is created by combining and cooking down olive oil, garlic and tomatoes. The secret – you add some of the pasta cooking water!      The garlic and olive are heated over a medium-low heat, which causes the garlic to infuse the oil with that amazing garlic flavor, rather than actually “cooking” the garlic, which can leave a bitter taste. Adding some red pepper flakes gives just a little kick of heat.      You can use any small tomato you like, cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes. I happened to pick up some of these gorgeous rustic tomatoes at our local farmer’s market and knew they would be perfect for this pasta. I love when they blister and burst in the pan.      Adding the pasta water adds a little starch to the sauce, so as it reduces down it thickens. What you end up with is this beautiful sauce that coats the pasta and gives it a luscious feel. The recipe below makes two generous servings, but could easily be doubled or even tripled.

Add the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes before adding the tomatoes and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until the tomatoes begin to blister, about 2-3 minutes. Add a ladle full of the pasta water and the chopped parsley to the tomatoes.When the pasta is three-quarters of the way cooked (it will still have a good bite to it), remove it from the water and add it to the saute pan. The liquid will reduce as the pasta finishes to form a sauce.Season with salt and garnish with fresh grated Parmesan cheese."

Now that my kids have started school, I’ve begun to think about easy meals I can prepare that will fit into our busy schedules. Especially on Mondays. What is about about Mondays that makes the entire day just hard to get through? It’s tough to get back into the routine after a busy weekend, so our Monday meals need to be fast, easy and delicious.      This past Monday, I came up with this Sloppy Joe French Bread Pizza. I love me some Manwich, as you can see with my recipes for One Pot Cheesy Chicken Pasta and Sloppy Joe Biscuit Bake. For the Pizzas, I used the Bold variety, but you can also use the traditional or Thick & Chunky.I started out sauteing some bell peppers and onions together, then added ground beef and Manwich Bold Sauce. I am kind of obsessed with bell peppers and use them for anything I can. The yellow and orange are my favorites because they are milder and have a sweeter flavor.                  As a bonus, this adds some veggies to your pizza and your kids will (probably) never know. I also like to grate carrots into sauces like this.      The French Bread is sliced all the way lengthwise and then smothered with that tangy sauce and topped with shredded Cheddar and Jack cheeses.            Manwich is available in three flavors: Regular, Bold and Thick and Chunky. The Kid-Stopping Power of Manwich makes meals a messy-licious treat to be enjoyed with both hands – giving moms and dads an easy, quality ingredient to bring the family’s attention back to mealtime and away from everyday distractions.

Perfect for a unique appetizer or as a delicious meal.      I have always thought that I wouldn’t like stuffed peppers. Not sure why, because once I tried them I realized that they are crazy delicious. I wanted to try this mini pepper version because I like the sweet peppers and let’s face it they’re just so cute.      My daughter, the picky princess, actually ate five of them, peppers and all!      Stuffed Peppers couldn’t be easier to make. Combine browned ground beef and onion mixture with some cooked rice and canned tomatoes – I use half spicy and half plain tomatoes, but you can use whatever mix you like. They are cooked until the peppers are soft, then covered with some shredded Sharp Cheddar and heated just until the cheese melts. See? Super simple!            I had some homemade Ranch on hand that I spooned over some of the peppers and it was pretty tasty. Of course they are amazing on their own, too.

320,"This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Farm Rich Smokehouse BBQ . All opinions are 100% mine.If you’re a fan of traditional taquitos, you will love this super simple recipe for homemade, oven baked taquitos. The barbecue chicken gives a truly unique taste to this Mexican classic, and the homemade Ranch (inspired by the Pioneer Woman’s recipe) is simply to die for!      I have been making Rolled Tacos (Taquitos) since I was in high school. They are always a favorite and I’m always asked for the recipe, which I shared HERE. But I had some Barbecue Pulled Chicken that I was trying to find something unique to do with and taquitos was the first thing that came to mind. I also wanted to bake them in the oven this time instead of frying them, and they turned out fantastic. By oven baking them, they aren’t nearly as heavy as the traditional frying method. I just brushed the tops with canola oil to keep the tortillas from drying out in the oven.      I decided to make a ranch dipping sauce, since barbecue and ranch flavors pair so well together. The base is The Pioneer Woman’s recipe, but I omitted some of the spiciness since my kids wouldn’t appreciate that. The base is a mix of mayo and sour cream, but you could use more sour cream and less mayo if you want. It’s really not about the measurements but about the flavor you like. You could also use lowfat ingredients. I used nonfat milk instead of Buttermilk, and I still loved the flavor.      The real key is the fresh herbs and spices. I used fresh dill (I seriously could keep this next to my bed – I so love the scent), fresh chives, and fresh parsley, along with garlic, black pepper, salt and some dried chipotle pepper (just a pinch). Mix it all up in a blender or food processor and store in an airtight container.The Farm Rich Smokehouse BBQ Pulled Chicken was a lifesaver for this recipe – Just open the package, stir and start preparing your taquitos. The meat is tender and juicy and has tons of great barbecue flavor. Using the prepared meat means less time in the kitchen, and more time enjoying the last few days of summer! Get a $1.00 off coupon now.These homemade taquitos are the perfect hand held food for parties. You don’t need to serve a ton of food to have a great menu. When creating the perfect party menu, remember to choose a couple of items that you can prepare ahead of time, like cold dips and veggies. Then have a couple of items that you will prepare on the day of. You definitely don’t want to spend all day in the kitchen!

321,"Goat cheese adds a creamy texture and tangy flavor to ordinary spaghetti sauce. Works with homemade sauce or pour it right out of a jar to save tons of time, making this a super easy 10 minute meal!      Spaghetti has always been my go-to for nights when a) I don’t want to cook, or b) my kids are balking at everything I suggest. It’s easy to whip up using jarred sauce and dry pasta and I can have dinner on the table in less than 15 minutes.Lately we’ve been getting tired of the same old stand-by so I decided to try to change it up a little bit. My plan was to make a creamy sauce using heavy cream or cream cheese. So I heated my sauce and cooked up the pasta, then went to the fridge to find that neither of those things were there. But I did have goat cheese, so I gave it a try and it was so delicious! My kids gobbled it up and there were hardly any leftovers.

Maybe that’s why I have a thing for breakfast sandwiches.      I also have a thing for croissants, and could eat them pretty much any time. Well, you know how a lot of yummy breakfast casseroles call for bread? It’s used as a binder to hold everything together.

323,"Pizza Pinwheels are so easy to make, and would be a great after school snack or finger food for a party or get together. With just a few ingredients, they come together in just minutes!      When my kids are hungry, they don’t want to wait around for a snack. They want something NOW. They pinwheels not only are ready in 15 minutes, but you can freeze them and pop them in the microwave – so much better than prepackaged pizza snacks!      Of course they’re not just kid-friendly, they’re a perfect appetizer for grown-ups too. Instead of pepperoni, add some shredded chicken, diced peppers, onions, mushrooms or any other specialty ingredients you like.      To make them, you’ll need to first flatten out the dough. I use refrigerated crescents (God bless you Pillsbury for creating these!) and roll them out on a lightly floured surface, pinching the seams together as I go. They don’t have to be perfect, just enough so you won’t lose your filling as you roll them up.      Roll it up lengthwise (or widthwise) – it’s your preference depending on how big you want your pinwheels and how many you need. Slice them into approximately one inch segments and lay them out on a foil or parchment lined baking sheet. One tip I got from a reader who tried my Jalapeno Bacon & Cheddar Pinwheels was to freeze the roll for 10-15 minutes before slicing to preserve their shape. I thought that was a great idea if you have the time. They bake for about 12 minutes to golden perfection.      Serve them with yummy dips or eat them on their own. They’re good either way!

324,"With fall quickly approaching, we start thinking about comforting and satisfying meals  to warm our bellies. This chili and cornbread skillet is perfect and so easy because it all cooks in pan.      I love an excuse to break out my cast iron skillet, and this chili and cornbread recipe is the perfect one. The first time I made it I had just bought my first cast iron skillet and I knew this would be the perfect dish to break it in. Have you used a cast iron skillet? I felt like I was really behind the times because it seemed like everyone had one – and they all had advice and tips on how to use it – it was scary! Season it really well, don’t put this in it, don’t clean it like this…seriously it was nerve wracking because I was afraid I was going to ruin the thing! But after seasoning it really well (a couple of hours in a 250 degree oven with a thin layer of vegetable oil did the trick), and letting it rest overnight, my chili and cornbread skillet was a success.This meal couldn’t be easier to make. Start by cooking ground beef over medium heat in a 12 inch, oven safe skillet. This would also work in a shallow, 5 quart (oven safe) saute pan.      Add the rest of the chili ingredients, chili beans, diced tomatoes, black beans and corn. While the chili is simmering, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and mix up your cornbread. I just use a box mix, but you could use a homemade version as well if you like. I like to throw in a cup of shredded cheddar, but that is completely optional.Turn off the heat and drop spoonfuls of cornbread batter evenly over the top of the chili. As you are dropping, gently spread the mixture around so it doesn’t all settle in one spot and you can get an even crust. Depending on the size and depth of your pan, take the batter as close to the edges as possible.      Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until the cornbread is beautifully golden brown. Check to make sure that the cornbread is cooked through before dividing into bowls and serving. Top with sour cream, onions and shredded cheddar if desired.

325,"Tender and flavorful and juicy, this pork loin roast is marinated and seared in a cast iron skillet to lock in all those yummy juices, then roasted in the oven for about 30 minutes.I love a good pork roast, especially with fall coming. This roasted pork loin gets it delicious flavor from the marinade or soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, dry ground mustard and garlic powder. It’s rubbed all over with olive oil to help keep it juicy and moist.There are a few things to keep in mind when cooking meat in general, but especially a roast like this that has very little fat and can dry out pretty easily.1. SEAR IT. I love to sear my meat, giving it a nice golden color and a crispier exterior. For this roast you’ll want to use two sets of tongs if you can, and turn it as it sears on all sides, even the ends. You want to avoid using a fork and piercing the meat, that’s when you lose valuable juice.2. REST IT. Trust me the smell coming from your oven as you are waiting for that glorious meat to finish cooking is enough to make you want to slice into it as soon as it comes out of the oven. But if you want to keep that juiciness, you’ll need to let the meat rest. The quick science behind this is that the juices all come to the center while the meat cooks. As it rest, the juices redistribute themselves all throughout the meat. Slicing into the meat too soon will result in a big puddle of flavor spilled all over your cutting board. The easiest way to rest is by transferring the meat to a cutting board (this stops the meat from getting overcooked by the hot pan), and tenting the meat with foil for at least 10-15 minutes. A good rule of thumb is about 4 1/2 minutes per pound of meat.Follow these tips and you’re sure to have a nice juicy and tender roast. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables, it’s the perfect fall meal!For more great oven roasted dinners, try these:Baked Chicken BreastsPan Roasted Pork TenderloinBrown Sugar and Garlic ChickenFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.Hi!

326,"These Barbecue Chicken Tacos are a fun twist on traditional tacos and so easy to whip up on a busy weeknight – they are perfect for Taco Tuesday or any night of the week!      My family loves tacos, and really anything I put inside a tortilla and cover with cheese. The first time I made these barbecue chicken tacos my kids were a little skeptical, but then they gobbled them up. I love how easy they are to make. They take just minutes in the oven because of the thinner chicken tenders. I prefer to use the tenders, 1 – because they take less time to cook, and 2 – because they are thin you get more seasoning/sauce per bite.I start by seasoning the chicken with my signature salt and pepper, chili powder, onion powder and garlic powder seasoning mix, then roast them quickly in the oven at 400 degrees. Before seasoning I always brush with a little olive oil – this keeps the chicken tender and juicy. Read more about my baked chicken method here.      I love to get a little char flavor on my barbecue chicken, but how to you do that without putting your chicken on the grill? Broil it! Baste the chicken with your favorite barbecue sauce, then crank up the broiler. This helps to caramelize the barbecue sauce and helps it stick to the chicken, and it gives it a nice little char, which I love. You can totally skip this step if you want and just keep the chicken in the oven for 5 more minutes after basting with the barbecue sauce.*Note – you could also cook the chicken on your grill if you prefer.      Now it’s time to assemble your tacos! You definitely want to give your chicken a few minutes to rest, but again, since we’re using tenders this won’t take as long. So just a few minutes and then you can slice the chicken.      Layer some sliced chicken in the bottom of your taco shells and drizzle with a little barbecue sauce. If you wanted to get really crazy you could add some Ranch dressing or even hot sauce. Then continue assembling with your favorite taco toppings – shredded cheddar, lettuce, red onion, cilantro, etc. I sometimes like to play off the sweetness of the barbecue sauce and roast some corn in the oven to go along with it. It’s make a nice sweet condiment for the tacos!

327,"This is our favorite soup recipe – a hearty Chicken Soup full of vegetables and diced chicken breast. The soup is then ladled over cooked pasta for a perfect 30 minute meal (that tastes like it cooked forever!).      If there’s one thing I can always get my kids to eat, it’s soup. Soup is the ultimate comfort food. It’s full of all kinds of goods stuff, and not a lot of “bad” stuff. For me, it’s the easiest way to get my kids to eat their vegetables! It’s also a great way to use the easy Baked Chicken Breasts I shared the other day.      And I use a lot of vegetables in my soup, there’s usually twice as many veggies as there is meat. One of the best things about making soup is it’s so versatile and completely customizable. The basis of this soup is chicken stock, canned diced tomatoes, canned (or in this case, fresh) carrots, celery, onion and seasonings.Let’s talk for a minute about the pasta. There are two schools of thought on this – 1) Cook the pasta/noodles in the soup, and 2) Cook the pasta separately and add to each bowl. You can see which side I’m on.      The best way to make chicken noodle soup, especially if you’re going to save leftovers, is to cook that pasta in a separate pot. This give you control over the texture of the pasta, and enable you to cook it just to al dente. Cooking the pasta in the soup can and will result in inevitably mushy pasta. And no one likes mushy pasta.Also, with this method you can control how much pasta each person gets, and if you are watching your carbs or need it to be gluten free, you can leave the pasta out.

328,"The addition of ground beef and bacon make these Baked Beans rich and meaty, and hearty enough for dinner. They also make a great side dish for potlucks and barbecues.I’ve never been a huge fan of baked beans. Not sure what it was about them that I didn’t like, probably the texture because I was used to them pretty much straight out of the can. Mushy just isn’t my thing. But the first time I tried Cowboy style baked beans at a potluck several years ago, I was immediately hooked.The sauce is rich an flavorful, with a slight smokey quality thanks to the bacon and one of my favorite barbecue ingredients – Liquid Smoke. The beans are tender and just melt in your mouth.This recipe is a doctored up version of a meatless baked beans recipe I got from a friend several years ago. It’s got a few types of beans, but you can use any type you like, really. It’s just the amount you’ll want to match – you’re looking at about 43-45 oz. of beans. I use the large can of VanCamp’s plus a 15 oz can of whatever beans I have on hand (and I always have several varieties). You could also use a mixture of beans, like 3, 15 oz cans.The one ingredient that’s a must if the VanCamp beans. The other are just the varieties/brands that I had on hand.

I decided it was high time to reinvent that recipe when I picked up some Chicken Apple Sausage the last time I shopped.My kids have always loved sausage of any kind. Not sure what it is about the stuff, but I kind of love it too. Call it a guilty pleasure. Although, this is chicken apple sausage, so it’s not quite as guilty.Like all of my one pot meals, this one is incredibly easy to whip up when you’re in a hurry, since it takes just about 30 minutes from start to finish.Start by browning the sausage and the onions, then add a bit of garlic. Stir in some apple juice with a little white wine vinegar to help de-glaze the pan.Finally the pasta is added, along with diced tomatoes, chicken broth, heavy cream, dried sage and of course a little salt and pepper. It all comes to a boil then slow cooks the past at a nice simmer.Once the pasta is cooked to al dente, the glorious cheddar (or Jack, or a mix of both) is sprinkled on top. I love fresh herbs so I usually sprinkle some on top no matter what I’m making, and I always have parsley on hand.

332,"A rich and meaty tomato sauce that takes less than 30 minutes to make. This simple Pasta Bolognese (or meat sauce) is full of flavor and tastes like it’s been simmering all day long!      So I know the first thing you think when you look at this is, “that’s not spaghetti!” I know, but hear me out. My kids don’t know that difference between pastas. If it’s long and skinny, it’s spaghetti, whether it’s actually linguine or angel hair. So, we’ll just let that slide.      Moving on…this is my go to sauce when I want something from scratch but I didn’t decide that until 5:00. It comes together in about 25 minutes or so and the flavor is so rich and amazing. This is actually a play off of my sister’s recipe that she is known for. She used two kinds of meat and would let it simmer on her stove all day long. I remember walking in to the house and it would always smell so good. This sauce is my quick version of that, and I love it just as much.      I also use both ground beef and Italian sausage, which makes this an extra flavorful and meaty sauce. In other words there’s more meat than sauce, which I love, but you can cut the amount of meat in half if you want it saucier.      After you’ve cooked the meat, drain it and add a can of crushed tomatoes, dry red wine, tomato paste, and a whole bunch of yummy seasonings. Then bring it all to a beautiful simmer. Don’t have red wine on hand? I’ll let you in on a little secret, I never do either! Instead I add 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar and about 1/2 cup apple juice and 1/2 cup water. It gives a hint of red wine flavor, and a little bit of sweetness to cut through the acidity of the tomatoes. I know it sounds totally weird, but we love it this way, and I’ve yet to have any complaints!            While the sauce is bubbling away, cook the pasta to al dente. Add a little cream and a whole bunch of fresh basil to the sauce just before tossing in the pasta.            Once the pasta is cooked, don’t drain it, but add it right into the sauce and stir it around to coat. This method helps the sauce cling to the noodles better. Don’t ever rinse your pasta!      Now you have no excuse not to make a rich and flavorful meat sauce – from scratch – any night of the week!

333,"A rich and creamy Swiss Cheese sauce coats tender chunks of chicken, ham and pasta, with a crispy breadcrumb topping. The best part is it all cooks together in one pan for easy clean up, and you can have it on the table in under 30 minutes.      Our family loves one pan meals. There’s nothing more satisfying than having just one pan to wash after dinner. Between homework and baths and story time, I’d much rather be participating in those things than standing in front of a sink full of dishes or slaving over a stove for an hour.      Start by heating some olive oil in a 12″, oven-safe skillet, then add garlic and diced chicken breast. You’re just searing the chicken, not cooking it all the way through.Next you’ll add the cooked and diced ham, dry pasta, water, garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, salt and pepper. Stir it up to combine the flavors and bring it to a boil.The type of pasta isn’t important, as long as it’s small. I love the way cheeses cling to the Rotini (spiral noodles), so that’s usually my pasta of choice for one pan meals.      Once the water is boiling, cover the pan and reduce the heat to low. Set your timer for 20 minutes and walk away. See? I told you it was easy!Now comes the fun part – the CHEESE! Cheese makes everything better, right? There will be liquid left in the pan but that’s ok – you need that to help make the sauce. If you’re a garlic lover like me, you can add another teaspoon of minced garlic here, but it’s optional. Toss some sliced or shredded Swiss Cheese in the pan and stir it up really well until all the cheese is melted. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top and place the pan under the broiler for about five minutes.       For more delicious one pan meals, try these:One Pot Beef StroganoffOne Pan Skillet LasagnaOne Pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada PastaFor all one pan meals go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.        Hi!

Diced and wrapped in crunchy lettuce leaves and topped with strawberries, toasted pecans and creamy Feta Cheese, these Balsamic Chicken Lettuce Wraps are a perfect summer lunch or light but filling dinner. Summer is salad season, and believe it or not, my kids LOVE salads and lettuce wraps! We stuff crunchy lettuce leaves with things like taco meat and cheese, chicken strips, and this Balsamic Chicken with strawberries and Feta.I’ve always loved the flavors of balsamic vinegar, and on chicken it’s so delicious. The marinade for this grilled chicken is super easy – balsamic vinegar, orange juice, olive or vegetable oil, honey and basil. It’s important to season the chicken breasts first with salt and pepper before placing in the marinade, and to let the chicken soak up those flavor for at least 30 minutes for the best flavor.You can then grill on the stovetop or on your barbecue grill outside. I don’t have an outdoor grill at the moment, but I love the char marks so I use my cast iron stove top grill and I love it! Aren’t those grill marks gorgeous?Lettuce wraps are a perfect way to eat healthy and add a little texture to your favorite foods during the summer. These couldn’t be easier to put together – all you need is the grilled chicken, sliced strawberries, pecans and some deliciously salty Feta Cheese.

336,"Crispy baked or fried chicken seasoned with dill and piled high with lettuce and crunchy dill pickles, topped with a creamy Greek Yogurt Ranch sauce. It’s the perfect picnic sandwich!      I’m not usually one to run out and try something new when I see a commercial for it, but I recently saw an ad for Wendy’s new Crispy Dill Chicken Sandwich. I’m a sucker for a crispy chicken sandwich and combined with the dill sauce and pickles, it sounded so good! I usually love Wendy’s sandwiches because the chicken is real chicken – not pressed together to form chicken. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this sandwich wasn’t the big juicy chicken I expected, but rather a thin pressed meat patty. Boo!      As disappointed as I was, I decided I could probably make this sandwich myself, and that it would be even better than fast food! I knew this was the perfect opportunity to try out the new Hidden Valley ® Greek Yogurt Ranch mix made especially for use with Greek Yogurt. Since my kids could eat pickles by the fistfuls, and they are total Ranch addicts, I knew this would be a sandwich they would love just as much as I did.      Hidden Valley ® Greek Yogurt Ranch has 98% less fat and 67% fewer calories than it’s traditional sour cream based cousin, making this dip a healthier alternative for your summer snacking. My kids love it because it tastes delicious, too! They loved it on the sandwich, as well as a dip on the side for chips and veggies.      To go along with the dill pickle theme, I added some chopped up pickles and a couple spoonfuls of the brine to the mix, in place of the milk.  The chicken for the sandwich can be fried if you’re feeling adventurous, or baked if you’d like to save a few more calories. I used a cornmeal dusted burger bun, but you could use your favorite. The Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt Ranch with Dill is spread on both the top and bottom buns for maximum flavor explosion.

// ]]&gt;Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Prepare Greek Yogurt Ranch sauce by combining, Greek yogurt, Hidden Valley Greek Yogurt Dressing mix, 2 tablespoons chopped dill pickles (optional), 1 teaspoon dried dill and 2 teaspoons of the pickle brine (juice from the jar). Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. (Can be used right away if necessary, but flavor only gets better with time).Rinse chicken and pat dry. If using full sized chicken breasts, pound to a uniform thickness, about 1/2 inch or so to ensure even cooking.Prepare three shallow containers (like pie pans) as followsFlour and dried dill whisked to combine in the first pan, eggs and milk whisked to combine in the second pan, Panko breadcrumbs in the third pan.Dip 1 piece of chicken into flour until completely covered, shaking off any excess.

337,"This herb rubbed pork tenderloin is seared in a hot skillet then transferred to the oven to finish cooking. The result is a flavorful tenderloin that’s tender and juicy and impossible to resist. It can also be cooked on your grill outside. Even as spring is soon coming to an end and summer is looming on the horizon, and people are searching for cool salads and refreshing treats, I’m sharing my favorite all time recipe for pork tenderloin. It’s pan roasted on the stove then in the oven which creates a delicious crust on the outside and holds all the flavorful juices on the inside. The great part is you can still throw this meat on the grill – it’s great for barbecues!I’m a sucker for anything that’s cooked in a cast iron skillet, but you could cook this in pretty much any oven safe skillet. Just remember that with nonstick you won’t get the same sear on the outside as you do with cast iron or stainless steel.This dish looks beautiful yet it’s quite easy to make. It’s truly one of my absolute favorite meals to make, and it’s easy enough for a weeknight family dinner, and fancy enough for company. I’ll give you a quick step by step, then you can download or print the full recipe at the end of the post.Start by trimming the meat. Pork Tenderloin is naturally a very low-fat meat, so there isn’t much to trim. But there is a thin, silvery looking skin that you want to find and trim off, because it tends to get a bit tough when it cooks. Then sprinkle on and rub in some garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning. (I know it says “poultry” but trust me on this one!).Next heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat and add a couple pats of butter or tablespoons of olive oil. Cast iron isn’t a must, but it definitely gives the best sear. If you don’t have cast iron, stainless steel would be my next choice. Just be sure to use an oven-safe skillet.Sear the meat for about 2 minutes per side – so six minutes total. The oven should be preheating at this time to 425 degrees.Once you have a nice sear on all three sides, it’s time to stick that baby in the oven. Add about a half cup of chicken broth (helps to keep it from drying out) and place in the oven for 18 minutes. I’ve got this down to a science in my own oven, but you might have to play around with the times in yours.After the 18 minutes is up, remove the pan from the oven and tent with foil to give the meat time to rest; about 5-10 minutes. (Tenting is just lightly covering with foil, in essence, making a “tent” shape with the foil so the steam can escape).Cut the meat into 1/2 inch medallions, and serve on a pretty platter. It looks gorgeous, and it tastes as good as it looks. For more easy meal ideas, be sure to try these:Bacon Wrapped Ginger Soy ChickenChicken Stuffed ManicottiPan Roasted Chicken ThighsOne Pan Italian Sausage and TortelliniFor all dinner recipes go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.

338,"This is a deliciously creamy and rich one pot take on a classic Beef Stroganoff recipe. Everyone will think you slaved for hours – they’ll never know it took around 30 minutes!      When I think of Beef Stroganoff, I think of a creamy rich sauce, soft noodles, and ground beef. I didn’t even realize until recently that Stroganoff is traditionally made with chunks of beef, like stew meat. I personally love ground beef – it’s so versatile you can use it in just about anything, and it’s definitely budget friendly. It also cooks much quicker than large cuts of meat, which makes it perfect for this One Pot Beef Stroganoff.The recipe begins with sauteeing onions in a small amount of olive oil for a few minutes. Once they start to turn a little translucent, you add the meat. I used my cast iron stock pot, but you can use any large 4-5 quart pot or pan you like.             The next step is to drain the meat. I don’t like to have to remove the meat from the pan, so I just scoot the meat to one side and tip the pot so the grease runs to one side, then soak it up with a stack of paper towels. You don’t need to eliminate all of the liquid – it’s what adds flavor too – but you want to get most of it out. Then you can add the rest of the ingredients – beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, milk, pasta and salt and pepper.      Stir it up and bring it to a boil, then cover and cook for about 18 minutes. Check the pasta after about 15 minutes to make sure it doesn’t over-cook. At this point the sauce will be somewhat thin, but it will thicken as it sits. If you want to speed up that process, you can reduce it by turning the heat up slightly and letting it simmer with the lid off, stirring often, until you are happen with the thickness – you want it kind of like a gravy. Finish it off with some tempered sour cream and fresh chopped parsley.To temper the sour cream, set it out on the counter when you start preparing the meal, so that it can come to almost room temperature. If you forget that step (like I usually do) you can add a small of the hot liquid from the pot to the sour cream and stir it up. This process helps to keep the sour cream from breaking when it hit the hot liquid.      You’ll notice I didn’t add mushrooms which you would typically see in Stroganoff. That’s because I don’t like them, can’t stand them, won’t ever eat them. However, you can add a cup of sliced mushrooms to the pot if you are a fan. I’d recommend cooking them with the onions, then removing them to cook the meat, then adding them back to the pot with the rest of the ingredients. For more delicious and easy one pot meals, try these:One Pan Caprese PastaSkillet LasagnaOne Pan Lemon Garlic PastaFor all One Pan Meals, go HERE and for all Recipes, go HERE.

339,"The flavors of a delicious, cheesy pizza in a fun to eat pull apart muffin! Perfect as an after school snack or as a yummy alternative to traditional rolls.I am always looking to come up with new and different after school snack ideas for my kids. Some of our recent favorites are Spicy Ranch Pretzel Sticks and Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel Sticks. My kids love pizza (who doesn’t – and if you don’t, we probably can’t be friends), so when I saw a few different ideas for monkey bread, I thought how fun it would be to have a pizza version.These Pizza Pull Apart Muffins are incredibly easy and take about 20 minutes to make. They start with a can of Flaky Biscuits, with each biscuit cut into quarters then dipped in pizza sauce mixed with shredded Mozzarella and chopped fresh basil.Next three of the biscuit pieces are placed in each muffin cup. There will be enough for ten full cups, with two chunks leftover. Just put the two in the 11th muffin cup – it will just be a little smaller. Make sure to grease the muffins cups well.Top the pizza muffins with more shredded Mozzarella and fresh chopped basil. Be sure to stuff a little cheese into the crevasses of the muffin.Bake the muffins for about 15-17 minutes in a 350 degree oven.My daughter was over the moon excited about these pizza muffins, and can’t wait to have them again after school today.

340,"A rainbow of crunchy veggies, all of which came from our local farmer’s market, make up this wonderfully filling salad, topped with a thick and creamy homemade ranch-style dressing. Thanks to Mazola® Corn Oil for sponsoring today’s post. All opinions are 100% my own.A couple of weeks ago I talked about how much we love the Farmer’s Market, and shared some of my best tips for a success market trip. Well what do you do when you’ve bought all those amazing vegetables and you haven’t used them quite all up? Don’t toss them, and don’t let them spoil – make this Farmer’s Market Salad featuring a delicious Mazola® Corn Oil-based dressing. A recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology found that corn oil helps lower cholesterol more than extra virgin olive oil. Did you know that corn oil has more cholesterol-blocking plant sterols than other cooking oils? Almost four times more than olive oil! (It also has a high smoke point, making it a great all-purpose cooking oil you can use for everything from sautéing, grilling, and even baking).A couple of weeks ago I was rooting around my fridge and came across several bags/containers of veggies that we just hadn’t quite used up. Normally I’d use leftover veggies for soup, but it’s just been too hot here for that, so I thought I’d take my chances on serving my kids a fresh chicken salad with a rainbow of veggies. I called it a “Rainbow Salad” and they GOBBLED it up! My kids love salad anyway, but this was like nothing I’d ever seen before. My daughter, the pickiest princess in the land, had TWO servings.This week I decided the make the salad again, for myself, for lunch to use up the week’s veggie’s and to make room for the fresh veggie goodness I knew I’d be picking up over the weekend. I love me some ranch, especially fresh and homemade, but I’ve never made it myself at home. I have a feeling I won’t be buying store bought again after trying this delicious recipe from Mazola! It starts with Mazola Corn Oil, sour cream and buttermilk. Add in some dried herbs and spices, a squeeze of lemon juice and some salt and you’re good to go. Put it all in a mason jar and give it a good shake to combine everything. Mazola has a neutral flavor, so it brings out the flavors of the other ingredients without taking over.I’m not a nutritionist, but it definitely seems like a healthier version to me! The only thing I didn’t include from the recipe was the chicken bouillon, only because I didn’t have any, so I’ll include it in the recipe below. If you opt not to use the bouillon, you’ll need to increase the salt.This salad goes great with homemade croutons, or topped with my stovetop grilled chicken!

341,"Sweet and salty is a classic combination. These Cinnamon Sugar Pretzels sticks combine the flavors you love with an easy to make snack.      My daughter has a crazy obsession with cinnamon. If it’s got cinnamon in it she’ll eat it. In fact, at the car wash today, when the guy asked what scent we’d like in the car, she asked if they had cinnamon. Yeah, she’s that obsessed.      After we made the Ranch Pretzels a couple of weeks ago, I knew that a sweet and salty version definitely was worth trying, since it is probably my all time favorite flavor combination. The fact that they are crazy easy to make is helpful too.      They are great when you’re craving something sweet, and perfect for packing in lunches or taking along on a road trip. And if you have a little one who loves cinnamon like mine does, you have to try this recipe!

342,"Barbecue Pulled Pork that’s dry rubbed and cooked right in the slow cooker for an easy fix it and forget it meal. Served on small rolls and topped with crunchy Pineapple Coleslaw, this sandwich is perfect for picnics and parties, or a quick weeknight supper!My son is the most curious child I’ve ever met. Yes he frustrates me, has a temper, and argues a little more than I’d prefer, but his sweet curiosity and the way he questions everything is definitely one of his greatest strengths. He loves all creatures, and is anxious to learn anything he can about them, how they lived, how they died, and what they look like underneath their skin or shell. I hadn’t quite realized how strong his interest in bones was until I found him in his bedroom one night with the chicken bones from our rotisserie chicken dinner spread out across his small desk.Once he realized that we actually sometimes cook food with bones on it, he started to question everything I purchased in the meat department. Recently my grocery store had bone-in pork shoulder on sale so I picked some up knowing he would get a real kick out of the bone. After cooking the meat in the slow cooker, it was so tender the meat literally fell off the bone. Of course I made sure to save it for my boy. Oh the things we do for our kids.But back to these sliders…I could probably eat pulled pork any day of the week, straight out of the slow cooker (not that I’ve ever done that…ahem) but on these fresh slider buns it’s absolutely amazing. And the sweetness and crunch of the coleslaw provides the perfect amount of crunch to go with the softness of the rest of the sandwich. The coleslaw is topped with a pineapple vinaigrette made from pineapple juice and olive oil with just a pinch of salt and pepper. The Pineapple Slaw is more on the savory side, but if you want it a little sweeter, add a teaspoon or so of brown sugar, and if you’d prefer a more sour note, add a teaspoon or so of Apple Cider Vinegar.The longer it sits, the better it gets. Trust me.The pork is simply rubbed with liberal amounts of salt and pepper and some other seasonings, and placed in the slow cooker for the day. If you have a bone like mine did, you’ll need to cook the meat a little longer, but it should be ready after about 8-10 hours. Once it’s cooked, remove the meat from the slow cooker and shred it with two forks. I usually remove it to a cutting board and empty the slow cooker. The juice can be reserved for gravy or stock (or simply tossed), which, if you use a bone in roast there will be a lot of. At this point the pork can be separated into family sized portions, depending on it’s size. We use it to make sandwiches, tacos, burritos and tostadas.To make the Barbecue Pulled Pork, empty the slow cook and place your desired amount of shredded meat back in it. To about 2-3 pounds of meat, pour on a bottle of barbecue sauce (or less, depending on your taste) and about a quarter cup of crushed pineapple. The pineapple is optional but I love the sweetness. Cook on low for 30 minutes to an hour, and keep on warm for serving.For more slow cooker meals, try these:Slow Cooker Chicken TacosSlow Cooker Chex MixFor more picnic friendly recipes, try these:Summer Vanilla Fruit SaladClassic Macaroni SaladHi!

343,"Hi everyone! It’s Jennifer from Town and Country Living back to share a quick and easy breakfast casserole that can be saved and reheated for eating later. I’m always looking for ways to add more vegetables to my diet, so rather than toss in the proverbial breakfast sausage, I opted for spinach and mushrooms to add flavor to this egg casserole.       Some breakfast foods are heavy and sit in your stomach like a lead weight all morning. I’m always looking for lighter options. This spinach and mushroom egg casserole is a variation of a Paula Deen recipe. If you watch her show, you know she tends to fix calorie-laden food. I cut out some of the fat in my version and substituted healthier choices.       This dish has your basic breakfast ingredients so no need to add any side dishes to the meal. You’ll start preparing this recipe by frying up some hash browns and sweet onions for a few minutes, then spread them in your casserole dish followed by a layer of bread cubes.       Using the same pan, saute your onions and spinach until the spinach leaves start to wilt.      Carefully spread your veggies over the hash browns and bread cubes. Your egg mixture comes next and will get absorbed somewhat into the bread cubes, which makes them soft and tasty after the casserole is done baking.       Cheese is sprinkled on top. I cut back on the amount of cheese used in the original recipe, but honestly, you could cut it down even more if you want to further reduce the calories and fat.      You’ll bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 35 minutes and remove just before it starts to brown.       This is a great dish to serve for breakfast or brunch. Easy to make, and it’s packed with flavor!You Might Also Enjoy …       How to Freeze Sweet Corn      Honey Lavender PeachesFor more great breakfast dishes, try these:East Breakfast PizzaBaked Cinnamon French Toast      ","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Spray a 13 by 9-inch casserole dish with vegetable oil cooking spray.Melt the butter in a large frying pan.

Spread the onions and hash browns at the bottom of the greased dish.Arrange the bread cubes evenly on top of hash browns.Using the same frying pan, saute the mushrooms for 2 minutes, then add the spinach leaves and saute until leaves are softened.Layer the vegetables atop the cubed bread crumbs.In a large mixing bowl, whip together the milk, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg and mustard, until well blended.Pour the milk and egg mixture over the layers.Add Parmesan as the next layer, and then sprinkle the Cheddar on top.Bake the casserole uncovered for 35 minutes, until slightly golden brown."

345,"Getting a meal on the table in 20 minutes can be a challenge, but with this easy one Pan Lemon Garlic Pasta, it doesn’t have to be. Pasta, lemon and garlic all cook together in one pan – making clean-up a snap!      With summer coming, the last thing I want to do is spend any more time in a hot kitchen than I have to. That’s why I love One Pan Meals! They come together quickly and easily, they have few ingredients and they are all cooked in just one pan for super easy clean up. I’m working on developing some more easy one pan meals to add to my tested and tried collection of over 30 (find them HERE). This Lemon Garlic Pasta easily made the cut because it’s full of flavor and comes together in just 20 minutes.      Pasta, butter garlic and lemon juice are cooked together in boiling water in a large saute pan or skillet for about 9 minutes. You want to make sure to season the water with salt as it starts to boil.      Fresh Parmesan and herbs add brightness and freshness to the dish.

347,"Fresh ingredients, like Roma tomatoes, jalapenos, sweet peppers and cilantro combined in your blender for a quick and perfect salsa that’s customizable to the perfect heat level. It’s perfect for Cinco de Mayo!      I’ve mentioned my affinity for Mexican food plenty of times, but I’ve also mentioned that I can’t handle a lot of heat. I am a complete wimp when it comes to hot wings, and hot salsa? I’ll pass. That’s why I love making my own – I can completely customize the heat intensity and keep it super mild, which my kids prefer as well.I got this recipe from my Aunt Carol and have been making it for years, who learned it from my cousin Mexican Mother-in-Law. It’s got all the components of a great and flavorful salsa – fresh, ripe tomatoes, both hot and sweet chili peppers, cilantro, green onion, garlic and lime juice. The heat level is tempered a great deal by the sweetness of the peppers and the mild green onion. But the jalapeno is definitely going to bring the heat if you let it.There is a ton of flavor in this salsa. The key to the heat is the jalapeno. If you don’t like heat, like us, you can get away with just using one and scraping out all of the seeds from the inside. If you like a mild heat, leave some of the seeds, or add another jalapeno. Three for a more intense heat.      You can also create a chunkier or a smoother salsa. I like my nice and smooth and easy to scoop, so I blend it til it’s a consistency that I like. I cannot tell you enough how much I LOVE my Ninja Blender (no this is not a paid endorsement). It costs a fraction of what the high end blenders cost and it is a workhorse. It’s got different blades, including paddle attachments for dough and one with a taller blade for larger quantities.

348,"Spaghetti and Homemade Meatballs in a light and fresh Pomodoro Sauce – so easy and ready in under 30 minutes!Pomodoro Sauce is probably my favorite sauce to make. I first had it years ago at Olive Garden, during my brief stint as a vegetarian in high school. It’s just about the simplest sauce you can make – with just tomatoes, garlic, onions and basil quickly simmered together. It’s ideal to use fresh tomatoes, but for this particular recipe I used canned. In my opinion they work just as well, and are much easier to keep on hand, but I’ll put both options in the recipe below.At OG, they have a dish called Capellini Pomodoro, which is how I first tasted this sauce (Capellini is just Angel Hair pasta). The sauce is designed to be just enough to coat the pasta, making it super light and not as heavy as traditional spaghetti sauce.If you have been following for a while, you might remember a while back I taught my son to make meatballs. We have been making them together ever since. I had never realized how easy they are! All you need is an egg, grated Parmesan, grated onion and some seasoning. The higher the fat content of the meat, the juicier the meatball, but really the ratio is up to you. Mix up the ingredients with your hands and scoop onto a baking tray with a cookie scoop. Bake for 13-14 minutes – that’s it! You could serve everything at this point, but I like to let the meatballs simmer in the sauce for ten minutes or so. For more easy pasta dinners, be sure to check these out:Roasted Garlic and Red Pepper Fettuccine AlfredoOne Pan Spaghetti and MeatballsSpicy Lemon, Bacon and Asparagus PastaFor all Main Course recipes, go HERE and for all Recipes, go HERE.Hi!

349,"Tender, fluffy Strawberry Muffins made even better for you with whole wheat flour and Greek yogurt. Perfect for breakfast or an after school snack!      Last week was spring break for us and I made sure to plan some fun adventures. We took a little mini vacation for three nights down to San Diego. We have friends there and spent some time at the Zoo, at the Natural History Museum and of course, relaxing by the pool. It was such a wonderful time of rejuvenation and the weather was absolute perfection.On our way back home, we stopped in Carlsbad to pick up some strawberries. I discovered this stand there near the Carlsbad Outlet Mall years ago, and it rivals any strawberry stand that I’ve ever been to. The best strawberries around! Once we parked we realized that they even have a “pick your own” option. My kids were pretty disappointed that we didn’t have time for that, but we’ll definitely be heading back.

350,"An easy to whip up pasta dish that is light and full of flavor, this Lemon, Bacon and Asparagus Pasta is sure to be a new favorite!      A few weeks ago I was supposed to be heading to a blog conference with some blogging peeps to Phoenix, but the night before we were supposed to leave I came down with a wicked nasty stomach virus. I was so disappointed that I wasn’t able to go! Since my mom had planned to watch the kids anyway, she still kept them for the weekend and I got such much needed recovery time and rest. By Saturday though, I was feeling back to normal and decided to take the opportunity to try out some new recipes.      This particular one has been on my mind for quite a while. It’s sort of a combination of my One Pan Spicy Lemon Tomato Pasta and this Bacon Asparagus Pasta from Gimme Some Oven. Her pasta recipe reminds me of something my roommate and I would whip up late at night years (or is it early in the morning) ago when we lived in a tiny apartment and would stay out waaay past our bedtimes.The bacon and the asparagus were calling my name on this particular day so I decided to whip this up. I had some juicy Roma tomatoes and of course tons of lemons (thank you lemon tree!). After making this dish the first time, I thought it needed just one more dimension of flavor so I added some red pepper flakes to help kick it up a notch.      Just a pinch of black pepper at the end finished it off. And then I finished off the whole plate. Unlike my typical one pan meals, the pasta is cooked separately, however I think you could totally make it a one pan by just increasing the amount of chicken stock (similar to the Spicy Lemon Pasta I mentioned earlier).              For more quick and easy pasta dishes, be sure to try these:Roasted Red Pepper Fettuccine AlfredoOne Pan Garlic Parmesan PastaOne Pan Creamy Smoked Sausage and TortelliniFor all main dish recipes, go HERE and for all recipes, go HERE.Hi!

351,"A light and fresh salad with grilled citrus marinated chicken and roasted bell peppers, onions and corn, all topped with a Chili Lime Sour Cream dressing. It’s a healthy alternative to restaurant style fajitas, and oh so tasty!      My family loves Mexican food. In fact I could probably get my kids to eat Mexican nearly every night of the week. One of my favorite Mexican dishes is fajitas. I love the steaming hot plate of chicken or steak, the sweet, crisp veggies and of course those warm, fresh tortillas. But since we are trying to eat a little more on the healthy side, I thought, why not make my favorite chicken fajitas into a salad?      I always have plenty of cut up lettuce on hand, since that’s generally our go-to veggie side dish. My son has been known to make himself just a chicken salad for dinner when he’s not pleased with whatever I’ve made. We actually picked up dinner while we were out grocery shopping the other day, and when given the choice between chicken tenders, corn dogs, chicken wings and salad, the kid chose to make himself a salad!      Anyway, I decided to whip up this super fresh and comforting salad meal the other day, and it was incredible. It starts with chicken marinated in yummy goodness, like orange juice, chicken broth, lime juice and a bunch of seasonings. The veggies are roasted in a super hot pan with some lime juice and seasonings until they are tender. The dressing is simple; just sour cream, chili powder and lime juice.

352,"Hi Everyone! I’m Jennifer from Town and Country Living and this is my first contributor post here at Yellow Bliss Road! Spring arrives this week and I’m thinking of all the wonderful farm fresh foods of the season. Like asparagus for example, which is my all-time favorite vegetable. Would you believe I never even tasted asparagus until a few years ago? It’s true!      About three years ago I became a vegetarian and I started trying a lot of foods I had never eaten before. Growing up, my mother served primarily green beans, corn, carrots, and peas as our side dish vegetables.      So when I first tasted asparagus, I wondered why she kept it from us!  Asparagus is packed with antioxidants and a good source of fiber, folate, and vitamins A, C, E, and K. Not to mention it tastes great too and is easy to cook.       To make Balsamic Asparagus with Parmesan, start with one pound of fresh asparagus. I like to stand mine in very shallow water until ready to use. I think it’s pretty enough to use as decoration.       Cut off the woody ends of the asparagus and line the spears on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.       Drizzle the asparagus without about 1-2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and then place in a 425 degree oven for 10 minutes.       Remove from oven and place the asparagus on a plate. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar or a balsamic vinegar glaze. I like this one from Fini. And just a word about balsamic vinegar. Some vinegar is labeled “balsamic” but true balsamic vinegar is aged for 12 years and comes from Modena. So if you want the good stuff (totally worth the price), be sure to look for Modena or MO on the bottle.      Sprinkle with just a touch of shaved Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve with a wedge of lemon.You might also enjoy these recipes from Town & Country:       Raspberry Stuffed French Toast      Asparagus and Spring Onion TartFor more delicious spring veggies, be sure to check out these recipes:Spinach & Watermelon SaladPesto Pasta Salad with Roasted Tomatoes & AsparagusOven Roasted VegetablesFor all sides go HERE and for all recipes go HERE.","Preheat oven to 425 degrees.Wash the asparagus; cut off woody ends (about 1-2 inches) and discard.Spread the asparagus spears on a shallow baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

353,"Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are wrapped in smokey bacon and marinated in a delicate blend of honey, ginger, garlic and soy for a deliciously easy weeknight meal!       I am so excited to share this recipe today – Ten bloggers have come together in a “Chopped” style Mystery Basket challenge! Ten food bloggers each added an ingredient to the “basket,” and we each had to choose at least three items and use them to create a spectacular dish. I am so impressed with the creative ideas that came through! Don’t these look amazing? When you’re finished reading my post, be sure to click around and save all the other recipes as well.      I used four of the ten ingredients in my recipe – Honey, Chicken Thighs, Bacon fat and Ginger.This recipe is so easy. It starts with bacon. And really it could end there, because, well, BACON. But, you want to continue because I promise it will get even better.So anyway, start with six boneless, skinless chicken thighs and 6 slice of bacon. Wrap those slices of bacon around the chicken thighs. I kept the thighs kind of folded as I wrapped them and I didn’t use toothpicks, but it probably would have been easier if I had. This would be great for stuffing with a vegetable, too, like asparagus. Oh hey, more bacon?      Mix up a yummy marinade of honey, ginger, soy sauce, garlic, salt and pepper and olive oil and let the chicken pieces marinate in the for a bit, flipping them after 10 minutes of so to absorb the marinade on both sides.      Heat a tablespoon or so of olive oil in a heavy bottom, oven safe pan. This is where I really love to use my cast iron to soak up the flavors of the bacon. Cook for a few minutes per side to let the bacon get a little crisp on the outside. You could skip this step and just go longer in the over, but the bacon doesn’t crisp the same and no one likes wimpy bacon. You can use your tongs to turn the pieces on their sides for a few seconds to render them out a bit too, and spoon some of the sauce over them as they cook.      Now put those bad boys in the oven and let them cook til they’re done, about ten minutes or so. Since there isn’t a bone, they cook quicker, however because they’re folded, you need to make sure they’re cooked all the way through.      Aren’t they beautiful?

355,"Easy to make and full of flavor, this Pan Roasted Lemon Garlic Chicken is sure to please even the pickiest in your family!      My kids aren’t huge meat eaters, especially my daughter. It takes a lot to get her to eat even a few pieces of chicken; and steak? Forget about it. But when I made my Pan Roasted Herbed Chicken a couple months ago, she literally gobbled it down! I’ll admit I ate two pieces, it was THAT good.      And friends, let me tell you, this Lemon Garlic version was even better! The tartness from the lemon and the kick from the garlic were magnificent and the rosemary gave a nice floral note. These recipes call for you to leave the skin on, and it crisps up giving the most wonderful texture to the chicken. Of course leaving the skin is all about flavor, and there’s tons of it in this dish!If you prefer to save a few calories and not eat the skin, you don’t have to, but let it cook with the skin on to give that nice juicy flavor.Pan Roasted Chicken is easy to make, and in just a couple of steps.      First combine the marinade mixture in a bowl and pour it over the chicken in a zipped bag. Let it marinate for 30 minutes, then place the chicken, skin side down, in a large heavy bottomed and oven safe pan just long enough to brown it. Flip it and brown the other side, pour in a mixture of chicken broth and lemon juice and slide it into the oven.      As it comes out of the oven, spoon those pan juices over the chicken. The result is a mouth-watering chicken that your family will be begging you to make again and again!

356,"Homemade taquitos (or rolled tacos as we call them) are so much easier to make than you might think. In just a few easy steps you will have delicious, crispy tacos that are so much better than frozen store bought.      When I was just out of high school, maybe 19 or 20 or so, I was quite close with my cousin who lives in Southern Arizona and I would visit often. Her husband was from San Luis, Mexico and she was always cooking fantastic Mexican dishes. She taught me a lot of them, like how to make Sopes, and these fantastic Rolled Tacos (or taquitos or flautas depending on where you live). They quickly became my go-to for potlucks, and I was constantly being asked to make them for parties.We would usually make them with canned roast beef, because it was easier, but I have since added the extra step of cooking the meat in a slow cooker to create an amazing flavor to the meat. The great thing is this recipe is versatile so you can use any type of meat – beef, chicken or pork – as long as it shreds easily.      For the beef, I place a 2-3 pound chuck roast in my slow cook and pour a cup or 2 of jarred salsa and sprinkle in a couple teaspoons of salt. This makes the most tender and flavorful roast! Cook it on high for several hours and you’ve got perfect Mexican shredded beef that can be used for tacos, burritos or yes, rolled tacos! Add a couple spoonfuls of the juice to the meat as you shred it, and if you have leftovers, spoon a little bit of the juice in the container to help keep the meat moist.            You can cook chicken or pork the same way. To save time with chicken, you can use rotisserie or and shredded chicken you have on hand and add tomato sauce and seasonings instead of salsa (I’ll share both recipes/methods below).To make the rolled tacos, start with warm corn tortillas. To make them pliable, wrap a stack of up to 2 dozen corn tortillas in a kitchen towel (not paper towels as they tend to get damp from the steam) and microwave on high for a couple of minutes, flipping once from the middle. Keep them wrapped in the towel as you work to hold in the warmth. Start heating some corn oil in a deep pan while your tortillas are warming. You’ll want a good 2-3 inches of oil so it’s deep enough to cover the tacos each time.       Using a large cutting board as your surface, work quickly spooning about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture onto a tortilla, off to the side, not in the middle. Fold the filled side over and continue rolling. Stick a toothpick through the tortilla to hold it into place. It took me a while to get just the right method for this, but once you’ve got the hang of it it’s super easy. If one toothpick isn’t working, use two. Continue this method until you’ve either made your desired amount of tacos or your meat is gone. If you have leftover meat it keeps quite well in the freezer.Your oil should be nice and hot at this point, and your tortillas should sizzle immediately when you put them in.      Fry the tacos for about 5-7 minutes or until they are starting to look browned and feel crispy. Remember that they will continue to crisp as they sit. Place them on a paper towel lined surface to drain, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.Serve with salsa, sour cream or guacamole. To reheat leftover tacos, place them in a hot skillet with a little bit of corn oil and turn often.

357,"A one pan dish with classic flavors, this One Pan Chicken Parmesan is sure to be a hit with the whole family!One Pan Meals have always been a staple for our family, like our popular Cheesy Smoked Sausage Skillet and Spicy Lemon Chicken Skillet.I saw the other day where someone wrote that one pan meals are the new casserole. I think that is so true! It used to be that you would have to cook all of your ingredients in separate pots and pans and then combine them together and bake in the oven for an hour. With one pan (or skillet, or pot) meals, you can have a delicious meal on the table from start to finish in just 30 minutes or less!There are a few reasons this works. The pasta cooks in the sauce, releasing starch into the cooking liquid which in turn helps to thicken the sauce. Plus, the meat continues to cook in the liquid which helps to make it nice and tender and keep it from drying out which can happen in the oven. Pretty cool, right?For this particular dish, I chose to crisp up my chicken by pan frying it first, then cooking the pasta with the sauce separately. You could also opt to cook the chicken with the pasta and I’ll give you directions for both methods in the recipe below. Don’t worry, either way it’s still a one pan method, there are just two separate cooking times.I’ve read other One Pan Chicken Parmesan recipes and they all called for cutting the chicken into chunks, searing it and then cooking with the pasta and sauce. But for me, the best part of Chicken Parmesan is the crispy texture of the chicken itself, and I wanted to keep that for this recipe.So let’s get started, shall we?First up you want to heat a some oil in a nice big 12″ skillet. Then coat the chicken in a mixture of flour and lots of yummy spices. Fry those bad boys up until they are cooked through and nice and golden brown. Set them aside on a paper towel lined plate.Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel and add a little more oil. Saute some onions until translucent, then add pasta, chicken stock, pasta sauce and some seasoning.Bring it all to a lovely boil, cover and simmer for just about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. There will still be a little liquid in the pan but don’t fret – you’re going to stir in some cheese and it’s going to create a lovely, creamy sauce!Place the crispy chicken back in the pan, nestling it into the pasta and top with a mixture or freshly shredded Parmesan, breadcrumbs and Italian seasoning before placing the pan under the broiler for about five minutes or until all those yummy cheeses are nice and melted and the breadcrumbs are lightly browned.For more delicious and easy one pan meals, be sure to check these out:Garlic and Parmesan PastaOne Pan Taco Mac and CheeseOne Pan Italian Sausage and Tortellini SkilletOne Pan Pineapple Rice and ChickenFind all one pan meals HERE and all recipes HERE.Hi!

Rinse chicken and pat it dry. Dredge the chicken through the flour mixture to coat it completely.Mix together Parmesan cheese, Panko breadcrumbs and 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning and set aside.Heat a 12"" heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add ¼ cup of canola oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken tenders and fry until golden brown and crispy; about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a paper towel lined plate. (see notes below if you prefer not to fry the chicken).Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Saute diced onions until translucent, then add minced garlic, pasta, chicken stock, pasta sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for just about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente (there will still be a little liquid in the pan).

358,"Barbecue Chicken Pizza wrapped up in refrigerated Pillsbury Crescents or Pizza Dough for an easy and tasty snack!Alright guys, I have a confession. I have a slight aversion to cilantro. Ok, not so much an aversion as an extreme hatred for those little leafy, greens. In fact, I have been known to send a plate back to the kitchen at a restaurant if there’s cilantro anywhere on the plate. Did you know that disliking cilantro has actually been shown to be hardwired into your genes? It’s true, and finally I was validated in my feelings!So what does my distaste for cilantro that have to do with Barbecue Chicken Pizza Pinwheels? If you’ve ever had Barbecue Chicken Pizza, you know that it typically calls for a generous sprinkling of cilantro all over. But there was no way I was going to buy cilantro, much less bring it into my house. So I used parsley. That’s right folks, I faked it.Because just because I’m hard wired (yes that’s my story now and forever) to dislike the taste of cilantro, doesn’t mean you are. So you’ll see in the recipe below that it’s optional. But if you still want the pretty green color to give your dish a show stopping look, chop up some parsley and call it a day. I promise you these Barbecue Chicken Pizza Pinwheels are delicious with or without it!What about you? Are you a cilantro lover or hater?Be sure to stop by I Heart Nap Time today, where I’m sharing an easy way to make Pizza Pinwheels, that will delight kids and grown-ups alike! For more tasty snacks, be sure to check these out:Jalapeno, Bacon, Corn Cheese DipItalian Chicken QuesadillasChicken Club Lettuce WrapsFor all snacks & appetizers, go HERE and for all recipes, go HERE.Hi!

359,"These Italian Chicken Quesadillas are perfect for lunch, dinner or even just a snack. Paired with the Greek Yogurt Dip they will be a hit with your entire family!      Last summer while we were remodeling our home, we lived out of suitcases and shuffled between hotels and my mom’s house for about six weeks. My kids were bored a lot of the time so we were always looking for things to do. I try to limit their TV time but they watched a little more than normal during this time. And we discovered a show called “Chopped.” I know what you’re thinking, how can I not have heard of that show before?! Until last spring I worked as a full time blogger and had a full time second job so that left little time for TV watching. All it took was one episode and I – WE – were hooked. Yes, my 5 and 6 year olds became Chopped fanatics too.      So imagine my delight when I heard about the “Chopped at Home Challenge” I jumped at the chance to participate! The idea is to use Sargento Chef Blends 6-Cheese Italian (with Mozzarella, Provolone, Parmesan and Fontina, plus Romano and aged Asiago), Chicken breasts, red bell pepper and Greek Yogurt. Much easier than lamb brains and cheese in a can!      I have been toying with an Italian Quesadilla recipe idea for a while and these seemed like the perfect ingredients to make it happen. So let’s see how it all came together.First you’ll season the chicken and cook in a large skillet. Then remove the chicken to a plate and saute some onions and red bell pepper. Finely chop the chicken into small pieces, or is you cook the breasts whole, you can shred them. Stir the chicken into the onion and bell pepper mixture, add some chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar.      To make the quesadillas, butter a skillet and butter two tortillas. Place one tortilla butter side down in the hot skillet then layer some Sargento 6-Cheese Italian, the chicken mixture and more cheese and top with balsamic vinegar.      Top with the second tortilla, butter side up, and flip.To make the Greek Yogurt dip, add some Italian dressing mix and chopped parsley.      So what do you think? Would I be Chopped? Or would I move on to the next round?Available in 30 versatile varieties, unique blends and distinct cuts, Sargento Shredded Cheese is always cut from blocks of 100% real, natural cheese. For more inspiration, check out the Sargento Pinterest page  or visit Sargento.com for more information.

361,"Juicy chicken stuffed into long rolls of pasta, smothered (and cooked!) in a delicious homemade marinara sauce.      Before I blogged full time, I had a job working as a church office administrator. I had about 25-30 volunteers that I worked with and managed and each year, as a thank you, I’d throw them a party. Church budgets don’t typically have room for this sort of thing, so I always cooked a fabulous meal and made the decorations rather than trying to have the party catered.      For one of the very first parties I threw, I made this Chicken Stuffed Manicotti. It was easy to put together, looked elegant and tasted amazing. It was a huge hit, and set the bar for the parties to come. Twelve years later, this dish is still in regular rotation, and it’s now become a favorite of my kids as well.      It’s basically a one pan dish, unless you choose to make your own marinara (which I prefer to do). Uncooked chicken is stuffed into uncooked manicotti shells (long, wide tubes), set in a base of marinara sauce and water, then coated again with the sauce.      The pasta is then covered with foil and baked for about an hour. The pasta AND the chicken cook in the sauce! Add some cheese and let it melt and you’re good to go. This is a great family friendly dish. It does take about an hour prep and cook, but it’s so worth it!

362,"Hi there, Yellow Bliss Road readers! I’m Darcie, from Such the Spot. I’m so excited to be part of the creative team and pop in each month throughout 2015 to share some great recipes with you!  Today, I’ve got a really yummy dinner idea. In my family, we eat a lot of Mexican food and when you eat as much of it as we do, all the quesadillas and enchiladas and tacos start to sort of run together. When my Mexican menus needed to be spiced up a bit, I came up with this fiesta-worthy take on quesadillas.      It’s a double decker quesadilla, made with corn tortillas. The bottom layer combines just a touch of subtle heat from pepper jack cheese with protein-packed black beans. The top layer is made up of creamy, sliced avocados and cheddar cheese. I could have stopped there but I went and topped the whole thing with diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro, green onions and–wait for it–a fried egg. Oh yes I did. Of course, for the choosiest eaters, you can omit the avocados or green onions (but I recommend keeping every last tasty ingredient!).      This meal is perfect for busy nights when you’re running between ball fields and dance studios and your family has to eat in shifts. Just shelve the ingredients in the fridge until you need to make a second (or third!) batch.Believe me when I tell you that not only did my family lick clean their plates, but they asked for more. Considering the fact that these quesadillas come together in a matter of minutes, I was more than happy to oblige.I hope you’ll try this recipe soon! If you do, I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. I’m easy to reach; you can find me here:Blog • Pinterest • Instagram • FacebookAnd if you’re looking for more great recipes to try, you might like myCotton Candy Margaritas        or Pesto Hummus Melts      For more yummy Mexican ideas, try these:Mexican SopesOne Pot Mexican Chicken and RiceMexican Chicken CasseroleFor all main dish recipes, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes, go HERE.If ever you’ve found yourself entering the term “quick foodie-friendly meals” into Pinterest’s search box, you’re not alone.

363,"Sweet homemade Teriyaki combined with lean ground turkey and veggies wrapped in crisp lettuce – a perfectly light meal for lunch or dinner.          I went on a kick last year, eating lettuce wraps for lunch nearly every day for a month. My kids even love them! You can stuff just about anything in them, and it gives you a little fiber and vitamin boost too. While I try not to make claims that anything I make is specifically “healthy” or “low cal” I do know that lettuce is a lot better for you than a flour tortilla or steamed rice!      One of my favorites I shared with you last week is my Chicken Club Lettuce Wraps. They are so good! But these Teriyaki Turkey Wraps may just be edging them out as our new favorite. I like to grate up some veggies and add them in too.First cook the ground turkey with some sauteed onion and lots of garlic. About halfway through the cooking time, toss in some fresh grated carrot and finely chopped broccoli. You could totally leave these veggies chunkier, but if I want my kids to eat them I have to get them as small as possible, in the hopes that they won’t notice they’re actually eating vegetables!*If you opt for larger vegetables, steam them separately and add them at the end when you add the sauce.While the meat is cooking, make your Teriyaki Sauce. I like to make a homemade Teriyaki (it’s super easy!) but you could use a prepackaged sauce if you prefer. Stir the sauce into the ground turkey and let it simmer for about five minutes.      Spoon the meat right into your lettuce leaves, wrap, and enjoy!           For more lettuce wraps and salads, be sure to check these out:      For all Soups, Salads and Sides, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes, go HERE.

These Smoked Sausage Bites are like a grown up version of “Pigs in a Blanket” with the savory, smokey flavor of turkey sausage wrapped in flaky crescent rolls. Serve them hot out of the oven with a sweet and spicy Honey Mustard dip and they are ready for half time!They are incredibly easy to make, too. Just roll out crescent dough sheets and wrap a sausage link in the dough. Be sure to press the seams together. Try to stretch the dough enough so that you get two layers all the way around the sausage.      Then cut the sausage into half inch slices and place each piece into a well greased muffin cup. Bake for about 10 minutes, and serve them immediately.      Sprinkle some Cheddar-Jack cheese on top before baking for even more flavor!

365,"Tangy, crunchy, savory and light – these crunchy Chicken Club Lettuce Wraps are a perfect light lunch or even appetizer – and bonus, they’re good for you too!I have a confession. I am addicted to lettuce wraps. I love crunchy food and lettuce wraps are the complete package for everything I love.Lettuce wraps can be low carb, low calorie and grain or gluten free, depending on the toppings you choose. This chicken club wrap has grilled chicken, tomatoes, avocado, bacon and a creamy Dijon sauce to give it a little kick. There are so many possibilities and options for lettuce wraps – you could have a different recipe every day. They don’t require much prep work, and offer a filling alternative to traditional calorie laden sandwiches or tortilla wraps, plus I love the crisp bite of the lettuce!The recipe is so simple, I can hardly call it a recipe! It starts with chicken, which can be barbecued, baked or even rotisserie, or use my easy stovetop grilling method. The perfect club of course has lots of fresh tomato and avocado, and creamy Dijon mustard. To make the Dijon sauce, simply mix 1 part Dijon mustard with 1 part sour cream, and add a few turns of fresh cracked pepper. I really, really like simple! For the lettuce I prefer iceberg or Romaine, but any crisp lettuce would work. Just carefully peel away the outer layers to the smaller layers underneath.It’s fun to eat, and can get a little messy, so be sure to have the napkins handy.Want more healthy options for the new year?25 Salads & Lettuce WrapsSpinach and Watermelon SaladThe Best Grilled Chicken SaladFor more delicious main course ideas, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes on the site, go HERE.

366,"Today’s recipe isn’t so much a recipe as a really awesome tip. I came across this idea for cinnamon roll waffles a while ago but I was skeptical. You’ve probably seen it too, but I had no idea that we would love it as much as we do, and it’s too good not to share!As luck would have it, I happened upon this a waffle maker at Target for $2.27. Yes, you read that correctly!! I got lucky one day right after Christmas when I was checking out the clearance section. I’m assuming it was one of those specially packaged Christmas gift kind of things as it was only something like $14 regular price. But for just over $2, how could I pass it up?Problem was my kids don’t like waffles. They don’t like pancakes either. Well that’s not entirely true – they don’t like MY waffles or MY pancakes. Give ’em a box of Eggos and they’re happy campers. Until the day I discovered that a waffle maker doesn’t have to just be used for waffles.Say what?? Mind. Blown.So here’s the non-recipe-more-like-a-tip recipe:1 can of refrigerator cinnamon rolls.That’s it.Oh, and a waffle maker.Heat the waffle make until the pretty green light comes up, then place a cinnamon roll in each section.      Close the waffle maker and wait for the other pretty light to come on to tell you it’s done. (If you don’t have a pretty little light, this takes just about 3-4 minutes).Now what’s a waffle without syrup? Good thing it comes right in the package! We don’t use much, so I just heat up the icing in the microwave for about 20 seconds until it’s pourable.

367,"Frozen Ravioli and Spaghetti Sauce are taken to the next level in this One Pan Skillet Lasagna. It’s a meal that’s easy to throw together on a busy weeknight, and pretty and hearty enough for Sunday Supper.      It doesn’t matter what day it is, my kids are always asking for Italian style pasta. I’ve kind of worn out my One Pan Spaghetti and One Pan Tortellini recipes, so it was time to come up with something different. My two littles LOVE Ravioli. Those little pasta pillows stuffed with cheese, chicken or beef are definitely the way to their little hearts.So last night when my son asked for ravioli – again – I quickly devised a plan to create something a little more special than just boiled pasta and sauce again.This dish comes together so easily, and all right in one pan!                  This recipe calls for jar pasta sauce, but I always doctor it up a bit – I almost never serve it straight out of the jar. Gotta bump up the flavor!Start by sauteing onions and garlic, then add the sauce and some seasonings, and a little bit of water. Heat that through until it’s almost to the boiling point (you don’t want it boiling because it will be splattering all over your stove). Then stir in the frozen Ravioli. I used beef ravioli, but you could use any flavor that your family likes. Bring it to a boil, reduce the heat and cover it for about 20 minutes.Sprinkle on about a cup of Mozzarella cheese and stir it into the sauce. The sprinkle another cup of cheese on top and cover it back up to let all the cheese melt and get yummy and gooey.For more quick and easy One Pan Meals, be sure to check these out:One Pan Spicy Lemon Chicken One Pan Creamy Tortellini & Smoked SausageOne Pan Pizza PastaFor all dinner recipes, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes on the site, go HERE.

368,"Tender, juicy chicken thighs smothered with savory herbs for a delicious main course that is incredibly flavorful. You won’t believe how easy they are to make!My daughter has been boycotting meat lately. She will eat a few bites, declare that she hates it, and call it done. But this? This she gobbled up in minutes. It’s THAT good.The pan roasting is actually a two step process. The chicken begins to cook in the pan on the stove, –  It’s seared, skin side down (yes, you want to leave the skin on for this one) – and then the cooking process is finished in the oven. It makes for the most tender and juicy chicken. Its totally worth the extra step.Start with olive oil and herbs in a glass baking dish. My latest herb obsession is poultry seasoning. It’s got Thyme, Rosemary, Marjoram, Sage and a little black pepper. It gives the chicken such an amazing flavor, and it smells absolutely divine. Whisk the herbs and oil together right there in the baking dish and the dredge the chicken through it, coating both sides. Give the chicken a nice sear in a hot pan, add some chicken stock, then slide that pan right into the oven for about 25 minutes. That’s it!The searing give the skin a nice, crispy texture and keeps the meat juice and full of delicious flavor. I promise your whole family will love it!For more delicious dinner recipes, be sure to try these:Savory Broiled Garlic ChickenOne Pan Smoked Sausage & TortelliniRanch Parmesan Crusted ChickenBalsamic Chicken TendersFor all main dish recipes, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes, go HERE.Hi!

369,"Thanks to Mazola Corn Oil for sponsoring this post. All opinions are 100% mine.I have always been a fan of pork chops, but my kids just don’t like them. It’s super easy to over cook the chops, which is why I really like to cook the Pork Tenderloin Medallions instead. And the addition of the Apple Chutney on top gives a subtle sweetness and tartness to the savory pork.      Pork Tenderloin is my absolute favorite cut of pork, but it’s easy to dry it out by overcooking, since there is very little fat. I have a couple of tried and true methods of getting this meat deliciously tender and juicy. The most simple way is simply rub the tenderloin with corn oil and garlic, and sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap it in foil and roast in the oven for about 15 minutes at about 425 degrees. But sometimes I like to get a little fancy, which is I why I started make this Pork Medallion with Apple Chutney recipe.      I’ve always been an olive oil girl, but new research has shown corn oil significantly reduces cholesterol with more favorable changes in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C than extra virgin olive oil. PLUS, corn oil has four times more plant sterols than olive oil and 40 percent more than canola oil, which research suggests help lower cholesterol. Who knew? I’m trying out making the switch to Mazola® Corn Oil and so far, I’ve been nothing but pleased! There are a ton of heart-healthy, tasty recipes using Mazola® Corn Oil over at Mazola.com, too! Get all the info you need in this handy info graphic below:Who knew? So I’m trying to switch to Mazola Corn Oil whenever I can.      This meal not only looks beautiful, but it tastes amazing. I seriously ate it for dinner, and then again for lunch, and again for dinner. It’s that good.It seems like there are a lot of steps, but it’s not difficult at all.Start by combing Mazola® Corn Oil and all seasonings together. Slice pork into one inch thick medallions and place into a Ziploc bag and coat with the oil and seasonings.      The meat is then cooked in a large, heavy bottomed skillet for a few minutes on each side.            The goal is to have the nice brown color on the outside, without overcooking, and essentially drying out the meat, so you want to cook it on a medium-high heat setting.The apple chutney couldn’t be easier. Cook some onions.            Add some apples.      Add some brown sugar and seasonings and cook some more.      It will have the consistency of a chunky applesauce and the taste is divine. Just make that if you use the whole allspice to remove them before serving.      The pork is served with a scoop of the apple chutney on top. Add a salad and you’ve got one amazing (and incredibly light!) meal.      Hi! I’m Kristin, the creative mind behind Yellow Bliss Road where you will be inspired by tons of easy to follow recipes, lots of free printables, and a little sprinkling of life thrown in for good measure.","Mix Mazola® Corn Oil and all seasonings together in a small bowl.

Heat 1 tablespoon Mazola®Corn Oil in a heavy bottomed skillet (Cast iron works great here). Once the oil is hot, place the medallions in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from heat and cover the pan with foil. Allow the meat to “rest” for 10 minutes before serving.During the ""rest"" period, prepare the chutney.Heat one tablespoon corn oil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until translucent and starting to brown, about four minutes. Add apples and cook for about three minutes, until starting to soften. Meanwhile, mix the sugar and spices in a small bowl. Add spices and vinegar to the saucepan and stir to coat. Continue to cook over medium heat for several minutes, until apples are fork tender.Serve pork medallions with a spoonful of apple chutney on top."
370,"Today’s Turkey Meatball Soup is a perfect hot meal that is super kid friendly. It’s a perfect meal to help you start teaching your kids to cook, too!I grew up cooking and baking along side my parents, grandma and cousins. That’s where my love of cooking began. My kids have always loved to help with cookie baking (and eating of course!) but how do you know when it’s the right time to start really teaching them how to cook?      The other day my seven year old son was watching a cooking show with me – we love CHOPPED! This particular episode had fourth and fifth graders and my son asked me how old he needed to be to do what they were doing. I saw this as the perfect teachable opportunity and took my son into the kitchen where we proceeded to cook a meal from start to finish. It was such fun to watch his expressions as he experienced new things, like mashing ground turkey with his hands.            He took the process very seriously, which really impressed me. Here was my bug-loving, dirt-loving son, with his hands a different kind of messy, excited about the opportunity to cook a meal for our family. It was a proud mommy moment!      Meatballs are actually really easy to make. We just measured a few ingredients – Parmesan Cheese, onion and an egg, plus the seasonings and then he mashed it all up. Then he scooped the meat using a cookie scoop onto a foil lined cookie sheet.            He was a little nervous about it, but he put the cookie sheet into the 400 degree oven. (For the record, he’s not using oven mitts because it was too difficult for him to hold the sheet. I felt completely confident that he could put the sheet into the oven and he did fine.)      While the meatballs were baking, it was time to start the soup. I chopped up the onions, carrots and celery with a sharp knife. Then my son added them to a large soup pot on the stove that was already hot and coated with olive oil.      He carefully stirred the vegetables as they cooked. Then slowly poured in the rest of the soup ingredients.                  We added the meatballs and noodles to the soup. There was a lot of waiting while things cooked at this point, so we washed a few dishes to keep him occupied.When the soup was ready to serve, my son divided it into bowls for his sister and me, and even served us at the table complete with drinks. He even sprinkled Parmesan Cheese on top.      Doesn’t it look fantastic? He was so proud when he tasted his soup. Even as I was editing these photos he looked over my shoulder and said, “Hey! That’s my soup!”      Kids who are taught how to cook learn life skills, self confidence, pride in their work and also how to care for others. All of these things are invaluable. There is science and math in the measuring and in the combining of ingredient, and social skills as we learn that preparing a meal shows how we care for another.But how do you know when your kids are ready? And what are they able to do? I am a firm believer that only you can answer those questions. I could give you a bunch of age ranges and suggestions, but really, no one knows your child and their abilities better than you, and every child is different.Here are a few recipes that my kids, at six and seven, are able to help with. I think that even a four year old could help with parts of these recipes.Sloppy Joe Biscuit Bake3 Ingredient ChiliBacon Ranch Chicken Pasta SaladTeriyaki Turkey TacosEasy Meatball SlidersOven Baked TacosFrench Bread PizzaTen Minute Oven Baked TostadasCooking isn’t just standing at the stove; there are several steps, from opening cans, to cutting vegetables, to measuring ingredients, to stirring, to serving. There’s also preparing – reading a recipe and purchasing supplies. All of these are things you can teach your kids. Think about your comfort level, and what you think your kids are able to do, then invite them to jump in!To get you started, here is my Turkey Meatball Soup Recipe, that is sure to be a favorite of your family like it is mine.Recipe adapted from Canadian Living.For more delicious main dishes, go HERE.For a complete list of recipes, go HERE.

371,"The weather is finally starting to cool here in Southern California, so I was excited to finally make this Italian Chicken Soup. It has all of my favorites – zucchini, cannellini beans, tomatoes and rotisserie chicken!      Soup is a favorite meal for my family.

But there’s something just so homey and warm and comforting about a great bowl of soup.Plus, they are really easy to make.

My kids unfortunately do not feel the same. At least in this soup I’m able to get them to at least try a little!      After a few minutes of cooking the veggies, you add the rest of the ingredients – chicken broth, diced cooked chicken, a can of diced tomatoes, a can of corn, a can of beans and some Italian seasonings. On the canned goods, I always use them with the liquid, but it that’s not your thing, just add a little more chicken broth or water.Let it all come to a boil and then simmer for at least half an hour.

It’s one of the greatest things known to man. Or at least to the people in my house it is. Bacon makes everything better.This mac and cheese is so easy to make. For the most part one pan is all you need. The pasta cooks in some nicely salted water, then the water is drained with some reserved for making the sauce (bet ya didn’t see that coming). The starchiness from the pasta water helps to thicken the sauce, and a little touch of cream cheese adds a great creamy texture.While the pasta was cooking, I cooked up some bacon that I’d diced up.      Don’t you wish you had smell-o-vision?So you’ve got the pasta and some reserved pasta water, then you add some sharp cheddar cheese, a couple ounces of cream cheese, garlic and of course, bacon. It’s seasoned with a little salt, pepper and dry mustard. The whole thing took me maybe 15 minutes from start to finish.      It’s incredibly creamy and rich.

374,"This Smoked Sausage and Zucchini Skillet and a quick and easy meal on it’s own, or is fabulous served with rice or pasta.Have you ever had an idea for something you wanted to make for dinner, and it turned out way better than you anticipated? Yeah, this was one of those.It was one of those nights where I had vegetables in the fridge that had to be used up and I wasn’t quite sure what to do with them. I’ve been really into cooking meals in my new cast iron skillet (I seriously love this thing) and I knew that the smoked sausage would add some really great flavor.Here are the tools you will need:First slice up the sausage and some onion and toss them into a buttered skillet. Because butter makes everything better. (You could always use olive oil instead).Doesn’t that look amazing? I promise it smells amazing, too.Add some minced garlic and stir it up, then add sliced zucchini, yellow squash, grape tomatoes, oregano and some red pepper flakes for a little heat.As the squash cooks, the tomatoes will begin to break down and create this amazing sauce, just enough to lightly coat the veggies and sausage. Once the squash was soft but still has some bite to it, remove the pan from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This was the point where I tasted the zucchini and decided it needed just a little salt. You could certainly leave that out if you prefer.This could easily be a fabulous meal all on it’s own, but we served it over some steamed rice. That sauce I talked about? It coated the rice and gave it such a great flavor.

376,"This easy to make One Pan Caprese Pasta is perfect as a light and fresh main course or as a delicious side dish to your favorite meal.      This Caprese Pasta is light and fresh and has the savory flavors of the classic appetizer you love, with sweet grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese and fresh basil leaves. The aroma of the basil and tomatoes as it’s cooking is just heavenly!This beautiful dish is surprisingly easy to make, and I love that the colors feel like Christmas. (Especially since it’s currently 95 degrees at 7 pm). Wouldn’t this be a great Christmas side dish?      Here are the tools you will need:Start by cooking some onion in a little olive oil. Add dry pasta – I love the larger Rigatoni with this dish, but any smaller pasta will do – fresh basil leaves, garlic and sliced grape tomatoes. Pour water or chicken broth over the pasta and give it a good stir.Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn down the heat and cover it up, letting the pasta cook and absorb the flavors for about ten minutes. Then remove the cover and crank up the heat, letting the remaining liquid reduce down for about seven minutes or so.      Once the pasta is cooked just right, remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle on some cubed mozzarella cheese. You could certainly use shredded mozzarella, I just prefer to have these nice chunks of melted cheese throughout the pasta. The fresh cheese melts much better than the pre-shredded. You might want to remove those cooked basil leaves, too.Cover the pan and let the pasta rest and the cheese melt for about ten minutes. Top with a sprinkling of Balsamic Vinegar (my favorite part!) and chopped basil leaves and serve hot.       For more delicious one pan meals, be sure to try:Spicy Lemon Chicken PastaCheesy Sausage PastaItalian Sausage and TortelliniFor all one pan meals, go HERE.For all recipes on the site, go HERE.      *this post contains affiliate linksHi!

377,"This hearty and savory Breakfast Skillet doesn’t take long to prepare and is a great way to start your day!I love breakfast. Unfortunately I don’t have time to eat a good breakfast each day. Between getting kids ready and off to school and checking Facebook working at my desk all morning long, I often just simply forget. I came up with this little concoction the other day, and it’s definitely been something I’ve been able to look forward to, ensuring that I’m always eating a great breakfast! It’s kind of like an amped up breakfast casserole.      This is a great one pan breakfast dish that can satisfy your hungry family. It would be a fabulous dinner, too. Who doesn’t love breakfast for dinner?I started by dicing some golden potatoes and brown onion nice and small so they would cook quickly. After heating a little olive oil and butter in a cast iron skillet I tossed the diced potatoes and onion in the pan with a pinch of salt to bring out the flavors. After about ten minutes the potatoes and onions were browning nicely. It was time to add the bacon. Oh yes.The diced bacon adds such a rich smokiness. Just toss it right there in the pan. As the fat from the bacon begins to render the potatoes and the onions are absorbing that great flavor. I don’t think the smell could get any better. The crackling noises coming from the pan and the delicious smells are enough to make you want to stop right here and start eating straight out of the pan.And you could totally do that. I’m not judging.But if you want to take it just a step further, toss in some diced green and red peppers. Oh yeah, bring on the color! I also added a little season salt at this point, but at the end I felt that it was a little salty, so do a little taste test and add some if you think it’s needed.Isn’t that gorgeous? Did I forget to mention we’re adding some sausage too? Yup. Cause that’s how we roll. I used some precooked turkey sausage (I use Jimmy Dean – I like that I can just have it on hand and ready to use, and it’s nice and lean).Again, this would be a great dish if you just stopped here. But let’s take it all the way to the finish line, shall we?Whisk together six eggs in a bowl until they are nice and fluffy, then pour the eggs right on top of the potato hash.Then you need cheese. You could definitely grate your own, but I like to go with easy first thing in the morning and it doesn’t get easier than pre-shredded cheese. For this breakfast skillet I love KRAFT Sharp Cheddar.However, my kids like it a little more mild, so if I’m making a cheesy dish for them I usually go with the KRAFT Colby Jack.So now that you’ve got your egg and cheese topping, it’s time to put your pan straight into the oven to bake for about ten minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking. If you like your eggs a little more wet, check them at about eight minutes.The beauty of the cast iron skillet is that you can cook it, bake it, slice it and serve it right out of the pan.

378,"This post brought to you by Manwich. All opinions are 100% mine.This baked Sloppy Joe casserole takes the classic Manwich Sloppy Joe Sauce up a notch for a warm and comforting meal, perfect for the cooler months ahead.      Be sure to stay tuned for the end of this post to enter a fun giveaway!Sloppy Joes are such a classic meal, that most of us probably recall from our childhoods. But there’s so much more you can do with this tasty sauce than just make sandwiches. You might remember a while ago I shared one of my very first one pot meals, Cheesy Chicken Pasta, that was made with Manwich. It’s since become one of my most popular recipes, and I think that is due in part to the incredibly flavorful, sweet and tangy sauce. We are all looking for Easy Weeknight Meals to throw together on a busy night, right? Here’s how to make this one. To start, you will need a can of Manwich Thick & Chunky (the regular or bold flavors would work as well, but wouldn’t be as thick), a 15 oz. can of corn (drained), a 15 oz. can of Pork & Beans and a pound of ground beef.       Cook the ground beef with onion and garlic until it’s no longer pink. Drain the juices off and add the corn, Pork & Beans and Manwich. Stir them together and bring to a boil over medium heat. I’ll be honest it tastes really good just like this, kind of like a sweet and tangy chili. But we’re going to take even this up a notch.      Grab a can of refrigerated biscuits (you want the flaky kind). Pour the meat and Manwich mixture into a large casserole dish and top with the refrigerated biscuits and some shredded cheddar cheese.      Bake in a 400 degree oven until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through.      Divide into bowls and serve hot.      This dish could easily be made into a one pan meal by using an oven proof skillet for cooking the meat mixture.Manwich is available in three flavors: Regular, Bold and Thick and Chunky, all of which are free of artificial flavors and preservatives and perfect for beef, chicken, pasta and more. The “kid-stopping” power of Manwich makes it a perfect weeknight meal solution that the whole family will love. Haven’t tried Manwich in a while? Here’s your chance because Manwich is providing me with an awesome PRIZE PACK that you can win!

379,"This Brown Sugar & Garlic Barbecue Chicken adds a subtle sweet and savory flavor that is truly unique and so delicious.      When I mentioned this recipe to a friend, she was a little unsure of the brown sugar and garlic combo, but I’m here to tell you – and my kids will tell you as well – it is AMAZING! The savory garlic blends so well with the sweet molasses flavor of the brown sugar. It would make a fabulous chicken dinner all on it’s own, but adding your favorite barbecue sauce sends it over the top.My daughter has become a picky eater. Like, crazy, “yesterday chocolate chip pancakes were my favorite and today I’d rather starve than eat them” kind of picky. (And yes, this really happened – who gives up chocolate chip pancakes??). But guess what? She LOVED this chicken. Even had seconds. That’s how good it is.      Please ignore the canned green beans. It’s the only vegetable my son will eat. He’s a little picky too.I used chicken tenders because it’s what I had on hand, but sometimes I actually prefer that to the larger chicken breasts. There is a much quicker cooking time and no pounding required. I think my kids really like the more sauce, less chicken ratio!It’s super easy to make, using just a few ingredients that you probably already have on hand. Our favorite Barbecue sauce is Sweet Baby Ray’s, but you can use any of your family’s favorites. For more delicious chicken recipes, be sure to check these out:     One Pan Spicy Lemon Chicken PastaLemon Chicken & Broccoli Rice Lighter Chicken Parmesan Ranch Parmesan Crusted ChickenSavory Broiled Chicken For all dinner recipes, be sure to go HERE.For a complete list of recipes on the site, be sure to go HERE.KristinHi!

I am horrible at meal planning and I usually end up making the same thing over and over again, much to my family’s dismay.Wouldn’t it be cool if you could just bring up a website and in minutes it would show you recipes that your family is practically guaranteed to LOVE? Enter McCormick’s new FlavorPrint technology. It is based around the flavors you and your family like and picks recipes that fit your flavor profile to help you create different meals that are matched to your family’s tastes.Here’s how it works: You create a profile on the FlavorPrint website, and answer simple yes/no questions about the foods you like, the ingredients you cook with and usually have on hand, and what methods you prefer to cook with (ie. grilling, baking, etc.). It takes about two minutes to answer the questions. Then you are presented with your flavor profile. I was identified as garlic/onion, cheesy, salty and coffee/chocolately – pretty spot on! From there, FlavorPrint suggests recipes based on your profile. You can refine the selections even more to include only main dish, one pot dishes, side dishes, low-calorie and more. Once you’ve tried a recipe, you can come back and rate it and the site updates your profile to refine your recommendations even more.I decided to try FlavorPrint one night while I was attempting to plan out our meals for the week. It came up with tons of options, and I settled first on Meatloaf, then after giving it a “thumbs up” the Garlic Cheese Bread was recommended, and finally the Supreme Pasta Salad; all three were a 99% match. I had to laugh when the pasta salad came up because it’s a recipe that I have been making for 20 years and it’s my favorite pasta salad EVER. So it goes to shows that the FlavorPrint technology works!We tried the meatloaf first. I’ve never made Meatloaf from a recipe – just eyeballed it – and we really enjoyed the McCormick recipe.      The Garlic Cheese Bread was probably my favorite – what can I say? I’m all about the bread! It went perfect with the meatloaf.      And of course there is the pasta salad. The delicious, savory, best for potlucks Supreme Pasta Salad. This was the perfect lunch for the week.      I’m so glad I found the FlavorPrint site – it’s really easy to use, has simple and delicious recipes that my family loves, and is truly tailored to our likes and dislikes.

381,"This post brought to you by KRAFT Natural Shredded Cheese and Safeway. All opinions are 100% mine.Summertime for us means much less oven cooking. In fact if it wasn’t for my children’s strange obsession with Mickey shaped chicken nuggets, I wouldn’t turn the oven on at all. These Stovetop Cheesy Flatbread Tacos are perfect for a quick summer meal.      We love tacos – in fact we eat them at least three or four times a month. They are easy to prepare and the meat keeps really well in the freezer if you want to just make a big batch and separate it into smaller batches so you always have some on hand. I was getting a little tired of our go-to crunchy baked tacos, so I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to try out the stovetop flatbread that I’d pinned oh so many months ago. Both of my kiddos are missing some of their front teeth, so having the soft bread made it much easier for them to enjoy their favorite meal – Bonus! Oh, and  I thought they were pretty delicious, too.      To make the flatbread, you start with refrigerated pizza dough. I looked for thin crust but my store didn’t have any, and the regular worked fine. Cut the dough into six pieces, roll them thin and place in a hot skillet with oil. They cook up pretty quickly – about a minute per side. To make the tacos, layer the hot taco meat on the hot flatbread. Top with a generous portion of KRAFT shredded taco cheese and give it a minute to melt. Finish it off with shredded romaine lettuce, diced tomatoes, and a little more shredded cheese.I used the new KRAFT cheese in the stand up pouch that I picked up at Safeway last week. I love that it takes up less room in the fridge and is so easy to pour!      These Cheesy Flatbread Tacos are similar to a Gordita, but much tastier, in my opinion.      Be sure to head to your neighborhood Safeway Just For You store to pick up the new KRAFT cheese in the stand up pouch. #StandUpCheeseInspired by Amanda’s Cheeseburger Flatbread Melts.       For more delicious Mexican creations, be sure to check these out:MexicanSopesMexican Chicken CasseroleTen Minute TosadasTaco Salad For all dinner recipes, go here.For a complete list of recipes on the site, go here.Hi!

382,"This post brought to you by American Frozen Foods Institute and the Frozen Food Roundtable. All opinions are 100% mine.One pot meals are definitely my go-to for dinner in our house. They are delicious, easy to prepare and require minimal clean up. This Lemon Chicken & Broccoli Rice that I recently created, definitely fulfills all of those requirements!Like most families, our family is busy. Oddly it feels like since quitting my full time job to focus on working from home and being more present for my kids, I have become busier than ever! So I’m always looking for short-cuts to help free up some time so we can enjoy each other’s company rather than me always being in the kitchen.One pan meals are the perfect way to do just that. Chicken and rice are cooked together in the pan with lemonade, chicken broth, fresh lemon juice and soy sauce.Frozen broccoli is added at the end. I opted for frozen because my experience has been that cooking the broccoli with the meal tends to soften it to much. I like my broccoli to have more of a bit to it, so this solution is perfect! I used the Green Giant Steamers and cooked it in the microwave while the chicken and rice were simmering on the stove. When I was ready to add it, I just gave it a rough chop and tossed it in with the rice. I finished it off with sliced green onions.Doesn’t it look delicious? The addition of the lemonade adds a nice touch of sweetness and the lemon juice gives the tang you’d expect from a lemon chicken dish.I love to use frozen vegetables in my meals because it’s so easy and you still get a great fresh taste. Frozen is  How Fresh Stays Fresh! Steaming them in the microwave and adding them at the end of your meal cooking time means that the vegetables are perfectly cooked, too – no one likes mushy veggies!I also love the convenience that using frozen foods offers. Some of our favorite frozen foods that we always have on hand are Eggo Mini Pancakes, and DiGiorno Pizza. My kids would rather have Eggo pancakes over mine any day of the week!This photo cracks me up. I said get a little closer together so I can take your picture, and this is what they did!Using the frozen pancakes I can still make a well rounded and yummy Sunday breakfast without having three pans going at once!Friday nights are pizza nights and they wouldn’t be complete without a delicious DiGiorno Pizza (it’s our favoritebrand).How about you?

384,"It’s Sunday, and that means another delicious One Pan Meal! Today I’m sharing a tropical twist on boring traditional chicken and rice in this One Pan Pineapple Chicken and Rice.      Like all of my one pan meals, this chicken and rice dish is super easy and quick to prepare and serve – under 30 minutes from stove to table. It uses sweet, canned pineapple plus the juice, but fresh pineapple and juice could easily be substituted.      Let’s get started, shall we? To make this dish, here are the tools you’ll need from your kitchen:Below are links to product I use and love in my own kitchen:Calphalon Stainless Steel 12″ Pan (a great budget friendly option)Chef’s KnifeCutting BoardOnce you have your tools, gather your ingredients: two chicken breasts, a 20 oz can pineapple tidbits in the juice, a cup of long grain white rice, 1 cup chicken broth, Olive Oil, salt and pepper, and three green onions.You only will use half of the pineapple, but all of the juice – alternatively you could use a cup of pineapple and a cup of juice. I like having some of the extra pineapple for garnish, and my kids love it for snacking later on, so this size works well for us.Start by dicing the chicken into large chunks and cooking it in some olive oil. Push the chicken aside and add the rice, stirring often until the rice starts to become translucent. You don’t have to cook the chicken through as it will continue to cook with the rice, and I recommend cutting it into large chunks to prevent the chicken from drying out.      The next step is to add the pineapple, pineapple juice and chicken broth. Stir it all up and bring it to a boil. If you like, you can add a 1/2 tsp of salt at this point. Once it’s boiling, reduce the heat and cover the skillet. Walk away for about 20 minutes (resist the urge to list the cover and check). Go do a load of laundry, empty the dishwasher, or just sit and relax and check out the latest Better Homes & Gardens.      When the 20 minutes are up, check to see that the rice is finished cooking. If you have a clear top, you can just give it a little shake to get rid of the moisture on the cover. If you are still seeing a lot of liquid, let the rice continue to cook, checking every couple of minutes.      Turn off the heat, give it a good stir, and divide into bowls. Top with additional pineapple and green onion slices for garnish.

385,"This One Pan Taco Macaroni and Cheese is the perfect blend of spices and cheesy pasta goodness. It’s one dish that your whole family is sure to love!One pan meals are perfect for busy families. They cook up usually in under 30 minutes and use just one pan for easy clean-up. Be sure to check out all of my one pan meals.When this meal was coming together, I wasn’t sure what my family was going to think. But let me tell you, my daughter LOVED it! She had two helpings and even asked to take the leftovers to preschool for lunch the next day. Lots of cheese and taco seasoning make this a warm and comforting meal that your whole family is sure to enjoy.      This dish calls for ground beef, onion and garlic, seasoned generously with taco seasoning, as well as 2 cups of dry macaroni, beef broth, water, and diced cherry tomatoes. I considered using salsa, but really wanted the taco flavors to come through, rather than the tomato and spice. I opted for fresh cherry tomatoes because I really like the way they hold up in the one pan meals, and the sweetness they add to a spicier dish, like my One Pan Spicy Lemon Chicken Pasta. They are also not as overpowering of a tomato flavor as the canned tomatoes.Here are the tools you will need:The first steps are to cook the ground beef with the onion and garlic. I scooped the meat onto a paper towel covered plate to drain it, but you could also just mop up the grease with some paper towels. Leaving a little bit is ok and just adds to the flavor.Next you’ll add the beef broth and water, pasta, tomatoes and more taco seasoning. I use taco seasoning a lot and sometimes will make my own but I often just use a packet seasoning or the Ortega Taco Seasoning which comes in a larger container so you can use as much or as little as you need.      Once the pasta and meat mixture is finished cooking, about 15-20 minutes. If there is still too much liquid in the pan, just turn up the heat a bit and stir the pasta as the liquid evaporates. A little bit is ok though, as it will help to form the sauce once you add the cheese. You’re going to add a whole bunch of that shredded goodness to the pan and stir it until its nice and melted. Place the cover on the pan for a few minutes to let it melt completely.      Once the cheese is completely melted, garnish with diced tomatoes and green onion.

386,"I’m super excited to share this One Pan Philly Cheesesteak Pasta with you today. It was a recipe that I thought up late one night and to be honest I wasn’t really sure it work out as well as it did. But oh my goodness was it delicious! It’s the perfect one pan meal that the whole family will love!      This delicious pasta cooks in one pan and from start to finish, takes less than thirty minutes, and uses minimal dishes for an easy cleanup.To make the pasta, you’ll need some roast beef from the deli. You want the rarest they have, and for them to slice it thinly. You’ll also need some thinly sliced onions and bell peppers.      I cooked the onions about halfway first, then added the bell peppers because I prefer to have the onions nice and soft and the peppers a little firmer.Next you’ll add the roast beef, some beef broth and rotini pasta. Once it boils you just cover it up and walk away for about twenty minutes.            After about twenty minutes, remove the cover from the pasta. If there is still a lot of liquid (and this goes for most of the one pan meals), just turn the heat up and let it reduce with the cover off, stirring intermittenly. This should only take a couple of minutes and the liquid does not need to be completely gone. It will continue to be absorbed as it sits.      Next is the best part – the cheese! I topped the cooked pasta with slices of Provolone Cheese. I only used about six slices, but next time I would use more.      Doesn’t that look amazing? Trust me – it was! I hope you’ll try it out for yourself.This is just one of the many Simple Sunday Supper recipes available on Yellow Bliss Road.

387,"This post brought to you by Pompeian. All opinions are 100% mine.This spinach and watermelon salad with a tangy red wine vinaigrette and cotija cheese crumbles is a fresh and delicious way to keep cool this summer! I love salads. Even better, I love salads with fruit. Remember several years back when salads with apple, or pears or grapes started becoming so popular? I definitely jumped on that bandwagon and haven’t left. My favorite fruit to add to a salad? Watermelon! I live to have a little crunch in my salad and watermelon adds the perfect bit of crunch and sweet without calorie laden croutons (which are kind of my vice).I also love to make my own salad dressing. My favorite? Red Wine Vinaigrette! For this spinach and watermelon salad I used Pompeian Red Wine Vinegar and Pompeian Olive Oil seasoned with a little salt and pepper. And since it’s National Vinegar and National Salad Month, this salad is the perfect way to celebrate by #DressingItUp with Pompeian Vinegars and Oils.For additional recipe ideas, you can visit the Pompeian website. or find them on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. For more delicious salad recipes, be sure to check these out:Pesto Pasta Salad with Roasted Tomatoes and AsparagusChopped Cobb with Homemade CroutonsEasy Taco Salad For lots of soups, salads and sides recipes, go here.For a complete list of recipes on the site, go here.Hi!

389,"One Pan Meals are quick and easy, and this One Pan Smoked Sausage and Rice Skillet is at the top of my list of favorites!      It’s hot today. Like mid-nineties hot. It’s windy too. Living in Southern California we are somewhat used to Santa Ana winds, as we call them, but when you have those high winds combined with the awful heat, it’s pretty much unbearable to be outside. Which of course makes it a good to cook something yummy.Since I’m not planning on braving the outdoors much today, I figured it was a good time to use up some ingredients I found in the fridge. Today it was half a pound of smoked turkey sausage and some sweet peppers. I love those sweet little peppers! At my local grocer they come in a bag with yellow, red and orange. They are sweet and crunchy and go perfectly with hummus or even my spinach artichoke dip. But today they are being combined with some savory turkey sausage to make up this delicious one pan dish.My one pan dishes are also a great way to get my kids to eat some healthy veggies. It’s hard to escape them when they’re mixed in to something this delicious!The best part is they are easy to make, and everything is done in one pan for quick clean up!Start by heating some oil and sauteing some diced onion and smoked sausage.      Next add the rice an garlic and stir it up a bit, cooking until the rice just starts to brown.      Add the liquid and sweet peppers, and bring it to a boil.      Cover it up and let it cook until all of the liquid is absorbed; about 20 minutes.      Does it look yummy?? It’s got such a great smoky flavor – your whole family will love it!

390,"Looking for a new family favorite that’s rich in flavor, and is ready in under 20 minutes? Then this One Pan  Spicy Lemon Chicken Pasta with Tomatoes is perfect for you!      I love one pan dishes because everything cooks up in one pan, so there’s very little clean up required. Our family doesn’t spend enough time together as it is, so anything that helps me get out of the kitchen quicker after dinner, is a real plus in my book!Like most of my one pan meals, this dish cooks up in under twenty minutes! Lemon chicken has such a fresh flavor, and there is a nice kick of spice from crushed red pepper flakes. If you are serving to young children, or just really don’t like spicy dishes, they can be left out.      Ready to get started?First, you’ll saute some onion in olive oil until it’s nice and soft, and becoming translucent. Then add some garlic and cook for about 30 seconds before adding some diced chicken. You’re going to just brown the chicken, meaning you won’t be cooking it all the way through, but just until it is no longer pink on the outside. This helps the chicken to stay nice and juicy as it continues to cook.      Next you’ll add the remaining ingredients – rotini pasta (any small pasta will do), grape or cherry tomatoes, Italian seasonings, salt and pepper, lemon juice, chicken broth, and water.      Stir, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Continue stirring the mixture often as it boils, for about nine or ten minutes or until the pasta is tender. Most of the liquid should have evaporated at this point, but there will likely still be some in the pan.Sprinkle with a cup of Mozzerella cheese, and cover for ten minutes to allow the cheese to melt. Any additional liquid in the pan should thicken or be absorbed.      Adapted from Martha Stewart.      You might also enjoy:Hi!

391,"Italian food is a favorite at our house, and this light Chicken Parmesan quickly has topped the list of must make recipes!      It has a delicious, crispy topping, but you only bread one side of the chicken and bake it, which helps to keep the calories down. It’s paired with a homemade tomato sauce that isn’t overwhelming and let’s the flavor of the chicken shine through. My son, who usually has a very strong stance on how spaghetti should taste, loved this, and asked for seconds! It also pairs very nicely with my homemade roasted garlic bread.Start by making the sauce. A large can of crushed tomatoes is the base, and you add garlic, Italian seasoning and salt and let it simmer for a few minutes before spreading a few spoonfuls over the bottom of a 13″ x 9 ” baking dish.      Then it’s time to prepare the chicken. Pound the chicken breasts until they are somewhat even in thickness. I just put the chicken in a zip top bag and pound with a heavy skillet. This helps ensure even cooking. Coat one side in flour, then egg white, then Italian Breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan Cheese. Place the chicken, breaded side up, in the baking dish.      Bake the chicken for 15 minutes or so in a 400 degree oven or until the breading is nice and crispy. In the last five minutes, add some shredded low-fat mozzarella if desired.      Serve with veggies, pasta, or by itself, with tomato sauce. Feel free to eat the leftovers cold, standing in front of the refrigerator. Not that I would know anything about that.You might also enjoy:Hi!

392,"This taco salad recipe is another one of those that I’ve been making for years. It’s based off of my three ingredient chili recipe and is absolutely delicious. My kids will just eat the meat part by the spoonful – they’d prefer I not add the salad!      I’ve recently stopped buying red meat for the most part. I really love ground beef, but it’s just so much better for us to eat ground turkey instead. I put it in spaghetti, chili, tacos. And in this taco salad. It’s so good I can’t stand it! I guarantee your family will love it just as much as mine does.I’ve got a really fun variation of this salad that I’m sharing over at I Heart Nap Time today too ~      It’s super easy to make. Start with cooking the ground turkey in a large skillet with a little garlic. I always salt the turkey first, but depending on your tastes, this step is optional.*A note about the turkey – make sure you buy the LEAN ground turkey. Otherwise it’s usually made from dark meat which isn’t going to save you that much on the fat.      Next add a can of chili beans and a 16 oz container of your favorite salsa. I really love this Rojo’s Fire Roasted Salsa I get at my local grocery store (Ralphs/Kroger), but any jar salsa, about two cups worth, will work.Stir it up, bring it to a boil and lower the heat to simmer for about ten minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and stir in a small can of corn.      Let the mixture rest for a bit while you chop up the ingredients for your salad. You don’t want that meat piping hot, but warm.I love a little crunch on my salad, so sometimes while the meat is cooking, I’ll chop up some tortillas and drizzle them with olive oil and salt before tossing them in the oven.       Layer up your salad, top with your favorite toppings – I use fresh shredded cheddar and jack cheeses, tomatoes and fat free sour cream. You could also add a dressing of your choice.      Doesn’t that look amazing?? It’s a pretty good for you meal too!For more great recipe, try these:One Pan Mexican Chicken and RiceJalapeno Cheddar PinwheelsHomemade Refried BeansHi!

Uncover and let sit for a few minutes to thicken and cool slightly.Meanwhile preheat the oven to 350 degrees for the tortillas.

393,"Grilled Chicken Salad kind of seems like a no-brainer, right? But I’ve got a delicious method for grilling the chicken that really brings in some amazing flavor to this typically “boring” dish!      The key to a great salad is to have flavors that blend well and compliment each other. I like a little crunch, a little sweet, a little smooth, a little creamy, and a little kick.      I always start by making the easiest grilled chicken right on my stovetop. To cook the chicken, you just need your chicken tenders, some diced onion, and a lot of garlic. Heat up some olive oil in the pan and cook up those onions until they are nice and soft, then add the garlic and saute for fifteen seconds of so (not too long – garlic burns very easily!). The fragrant garlic and onion sauteing together is one of my favorite cooking smells!Season that chicken with lots of salt and pepper. Or not a lot. This is really a personal preference. But definitely give it a good sprinkling of both.      Place the chicken in the pan and cook until they are golden brown on both sides. I love this point – my kitchen smalls AMAZING! Once they are cooked through, remove them from the pan and set aside.Now it’s time to make your salad. Chop up your favorite veggies and salad toppings – my favorites are hard boiled eggs, sweet peppers, tomatoes, and of course my favorite Spicy Garlic Vinaigrette Dressing and homemade croutons (not pictured, but click on the link and you can grab those recipes). Just about any of your favorite salad toppings will work – what’s yours?There you have it – my favorite grilled chicken salad!

394,"Looking for a deliciously satisfying and savory meal? This Balsamic Chicken recipe definitely fits the bill!      I used to cook with balsamic vinegar all the time. I loved it on chicken, on pasta, on bread (dipped with olive oil of course) and it’s been ages since I’ve cooked with it. I recently found a bottle in the back of my cupboard and that prompted me to whip up a dish I haven’t made since my pre-children days. Well guess what? They loved it to!Balsamic Chicken tenders are a super simple recipe to make. Just whisk the marinade together and pour it over the chicken. Allow it to sit for at least half an hour (but a couple of hours is best), then cook it up on the stove. You’ll get to watch it get all nice and brown and yummy.

395,"Spaghetti and Meatballs is an American classic, and this one pan version of the traditional meal is sure to knock their socks off!          Years ago, I dated a guy who made THE BEST leftover spaghetti. Instead of heating it up in the microwave, he would toss it all in a skillet with a bunch of grated Parmesan and cook it all up over high heat. It was a quick way to heat it up but there was just something about that method of pan frying the pasta IN the sauce that made it taste so delicious.When I started working on this recipe, I hadn’t even thought about that story, but as I took my first bite, I realized that this was so much like that leftover dish that I absolutely loved.The beauty of one pot or one pan meals, like my one pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Pasta, is that you only need to use one pan, and it’s typically on the table in under thirty minutes, making it perfect for busy families.This one pan spaghetti and meatballs dish is just as easy!Start by grabbing a 12″ skillet (be sure it has a lid because you’re going to cover it up later. (I use this stainless steel pan from Calphalon).First you’re going to add the ingredients to the pan – beef broth (or water, if you prefer), spaghetti sauce, some Italian seasonings, garlic and salt and pepper. You could definitely start by sauteing some diced onions and then add everything else in, I just didn’t have any on hand. Break the spaghetti in half so it will fit better in the pan and toss it in.      Next your going to bring that to a boil, then turn down the heat and let it cook for a bit. You want to make sure and stir the pasta at least once to keep the pasta from sticking together. Towards the end of the cooking time you’ll add in some frozen meatballs. Cover it back up and let it continue to cook for just a few minutes until the meatballs are hot and the pasta is tender.      You can see in the photo that the sauce is almost completely absorbed. I actually ended up needed to add a little more liquid which will be reflected in the recipe below. With any one pot means, if you notice it seems to be reducing too quickly, don’t be afraid to add a little more water or broth to the pan. You can always drain it out at the end if necessary.Once the meatballs are hot and the pasta is cooked, it’s time to add that delicious cheese! I sprinkled on about one cup of shredded Mozzarella and about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan. Remove the pan from the heat and cover it back up to allow the cheese to melt. Alternatively, you could put the pan under the broiler for a few minutes.          Just make sure to remove the Bay leaf before digging in!It’s important to note, this recipe made about four servings, but we definitely could have eaten more. If you have a larger family, I would double the recipe.      You might also enjoy:One Pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada PastaOne Pot Cheesy Sausage PastaOne Pot Mexican Chicken and RiceHi!

396,"This one pan Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Pasta is based on a favorite recipe of mine that my cousin makes. It’s her specialty and the one I always would ask for it any time I would go to visit. While hers is a traditional enchilada casserole, my version is made with Rotini pasta. It’s rich and creamy, with just enough spicy to make it interesting!      Like all of my one pot meals, this pasta is a quick and easy option for busy weeknights, and it makes a great Sunday supper too. Served with a salad on the side, it’s a hearty meal that will quickly become a family favorite.This Green Chile Chicken Enchilada Pasta all cooks in one pan (I use this stainless steel pan from Calphalon), so clean up is easy. Start by sauteing the onions then adding diced chicken breasts and garlic. When you dice up the chicken, be sure to cut  it into large chunks. Smaller pieces tend to cook too fast and dry out quickly.I wish you could smell how good this smells.      The chicken doesn’t need to be cooked through at this point because it will continue cooking in the sauce.Next add the rest of the ingredients, except the cheeses. Stir it all up and bring it to a boil. Cover that baby up and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes.      Once that twenty minutes is up, lift the lid and see that the sauce has reduced down and the pasta is tender. Stir in the cream cheese, then sprinkle with jack cheese. Cover it back up so the cheeses can melt and create a fantastically spicy, creamy sauce.            You might also enjoy:Mexican Chicken and RiceTeriyaki Turkey TacosHi!

There are a ton of bloggers sharing their favorite simple, family friendly recipes, and a few easy crafts too! My favorite dishes to make when I need something quick and easy are one pot meals, and this delicious one pot Mexican Chicken and Rice tops the list. Mexican food is a staple in my home and something that I cook at least once a week if not more. My cousin learned how to make spanish rice from her Mexican mother-in-law. I put a little spin on it and created a dish that your whole family will love. Mine sure did!      Can I just take a second to gush about my dear friend Katie of Katie’s Cucina and Sew Woodsy!!! I just love her to pieces and was so lucky to have not only roomed with her at the SNAP Conference last year, but to get to have dinner with her during my recent trip to Florida! We live on opposite coasts so I was so glad that I got to see her and spend an evening with her. Katie and her hubby, Jon, are expecting baby number 1 and IT’S A BOY! Congratulations my friend – I wish you all the happiness in the world and I can’t wait to see that new little bundle’s sweet face!

It’s one of those restaurants where I order the same thing every time I go – specifically the Teriyaki Chicken Tacos. After 20 years I finally decided it was time to attempt to recreate my favorite dish at home. These Teriyaki Turkey Tacos were the result.      I opted for a bottle of Lawry’s Teriyaki marinade for this particular recipe, but if you have a favorite Teriyaki sauce recipe you can use that, or use this great recipe that I found at Damn Delicious. The key is that you want a thicker sauce, a so it’s not too runny.The first step is to cook the ground turkey. Heat a small amount of oil in a pan and add some garlic for about 30 seconds before adding the turkey. I usually use my hands for this part, breaking it up as much as possible. Then while it’s cooking, constantly stir the meat to break up any large pieces.Add the pineapple and teriyaki sauce and heat through.Prepare the tortillas by warming in a skillet, or do what I do and use a pair of tongs to hold the as you char them on each side. I much prefer the direct flame method. The tortillas are still soft and slightly crispy and so delicious. All that’s left to do is build your tacos, and enjoy!These tacos are so easy to make and are so incredibly delicious and if you opt for the bottle marinade they only take about 15 minutes from start to finish.

I’m excited to share a super yummy (and easy, and healthy) Chicken and Vegetable Stir Fry with you! One pot meals are usually my go-to for busy weeknights, and I definitely add this one into my meal rotation at least a couple times a month.      This dish has lots of crisp, colorful veggies, and a nice light sauce. You can choose your favorite veggies to add – I love zucchini, orange and red bell peppers, and onions – but you can also add sugar snap peas, broccoli, carrots or mushrooms. It is delicious over white or brown rice, or noodles. Or if you’re being carb conscious, it’s fabulous just on it’s own!Very few ingredients are required; in fact you probably have all of them in your kitchen right now! You’ll need a couple of chicken breasts, your favorite veggies cut into nice big chunks, chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch and a little ginger and garlic. I like to chop my veggies nice and big and the colors are just so fabulous together. It just makes me happy!      I usually serve this with my kids’ favorite “sticky rice” but it’s a great meal all on it’s own. And it reheats perfectly for lunch the next day. (If you manage to save any leftovers…we rarely do!)For more delicious one pot meals, try these:Tortellini and Sausage SkilletLime Chicken, Broccoli and Rice SkilletHi!

Add the chicken and cook until the chicken is cooked through.Serve over rice or noodles, or enjoy on it's own."

It’s funny how things you didn’t care for as a child you come to love as a adult. I love broccoli and I’m always adding it to meals. This Chicken Broccoli Rice has a hint of garlic and lime and is absolutely delicious, and so simple to make.      One pot meals Like my Creamy Tortellini and Sausage, or my Pizza Pasta, are so easy to throw together, especially on busy weeknights.

401,"Over Christmas break, I had lots of time to work on some fun and tasty snacks since my kids obviously don’t want the same old turkey sandwiches every day. One day we tried a new snack idea for lunch – Triscuit Pizza! It was the best thing to happen to lunch in a long time!This is one of those slap yourself on the head and wonder why you never tried it before kind of things. It takes about five minutes to make and ten minutes to bake. And you have a quick, healthy, semi-homemade lunch!      First you take some foil and cover a cookie sheet with it to keep the cheese from sticking. I love anything with easy clean up! Then lay out the crackers, placing them side by side. to form a rectangle. Next you pour a little pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce right over the top of the Triscuits, and spread that over the crackers with a spoon.      Sprinkle with cheese – Mozzarella, Cheddar, Jack or Parmesan, or a combination of them, works really well.Finally it’s time to add your favorite toppings. We chose chicken, black olives and green onions, because that’s what we had on hand. But you could add pepperoni or sausage, pineapple, green peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms. The possibilities are (almost) endless!      Notice the toppings don’t cover the whole pizza? My daughter refuses to eat anything but cheese!Put the cookie sheet in a 350 degree oven and bake for about 10 minutes or until the cheese is nice and melty. Serve immediately.      Now, you could easily make this by spreading sauce and cheese on individual crackers and heating in the microwave. Personally I prefer the oven method because it toasts the crackers nicely and it’s much easier to prepare.It’s a healthy alternative to traditional pizza, because Triscuits are made from whole grains and they have lots of yummy flavors. The Garlic flavored is favorite! (And no, this is not a sponsored post – I just happen to love Triscuits!)What would you put on top of your Triscuit Pizza?       Here are a few more appetizers you might like:Spinach Artichoke DipSkinny Southwest Chicken DipEasy Meatball SlidersHi!

It’s what my kids say is their favorite food, and it’s what this mom loves to cook, because let’s face, it doesn’t get much easier! I recently realized that my kids have never had lasagna, and that kind of shocked me because I LOVE lasagna! Of course, lasagna isn’t the easiest or quickest dish to make, so I thought  why not make a one post lasagna meal, since one pot meals are a favorite in our house!?       It only takes about thirty minutes from start to finish, and you have a hot, delicious comfort food on that table, that’s sure to become a family favorite. It’s definitely being added to our weeknight menu!The first thing to do is head to your local Safeway store and take advantage of the in-store offer of $1 savings on your favorite Barilla Spaghetti Sauce and $1 off of Barilla Oven Ready Lasagna noodles.      I always gave garlic on hand but if you don’t, grab some of that too – get the minced garlic in a jar just ’cause it’s super easy. While you’re at it, you’ll need a pound of hamburger meat, chicken broth and Ricotta and Mozzarella cheeses.You’ll put it all together, cook it for about 20 minutes, and then you get to taste this:       Doesn’t that look amazing?? Keep in mind this isn’t a traditional casserole, so it doesn’t cut into nice, neat little squares. But trust me, with all the time you’ve saved you won’t care – it’s still delicious!A lot of people ask what pan I use. I used my Simply Calphalon Nonstick 5-qt. Sauté Pan for this recipe. It’s a great non-stick pan, it’s held up fabulously for years, and clean up is a snap! I recently purchased a Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless Steel 12″ Everyday Pan and that one is just as fabulous. Both are perfect for my one pot meals.

My recipe is a little different, but the method is basically the same.

A pot roast would work beautifully for this.In a 12"" skillet over medium heat, combine shredded beef, salsa and black beans. Cook until combined and warm throughout.Spread chips out on a large cookie sheet. Top with meat/bean/salsa mixture and sprinkle cheese on top.Bake in a preheated 350 degree over for 7-10 minutes.Squeeze lime juice over the top and garnish with green onions, sour cream, jalapenos, or any other favorite nacho topping!Plate up, serve hot, and enjoy!"

This Chopped Cobb Salad has a spicy garlic vinaigrette dressing and delicious homemade garlic & herb croutons!I LOVE salads, and lately, chopped salads are my favorite. So it made sense to create a chopped salad that everyone would love – a Chopped Cobb! The dressing is a tangy, slightly spicy, garlic vinaigrette. What knocks this salad out of the park though, are the homemade garlic & herb croutons. Holy goodness they are addicting, and so easy to make!Find the recipe for the Homemade Croutons HERE.Hi!

Never fear – I’m going to show you to freeze your ground beef so you can thaw it quickly – in under 20 minutes – with no microwaving!One of those meals was my dad’s “famous” (in our house anyway) meatloaf. I’ll share the recipe with you later in the week, but I wanted to first share a little tip with you that I learned not too long ago that has made my life a heck of a lot easier.If you already knew this, do me a favor and humor me, k?I like to buy the bulk size packages of ground beef, but because we are a small family, I can actually get four meals out of a package.I used to just cut the package in four equal parts and wrap and freeze it in a big chunk. But it would take FOREVER to thaw, and forget it if you just decided on the way home that you were making tacos. There was just no time to thaw the meat, and I hate thawing meat on my kitchen counter.Sooooo I remember this trick a friend taught me and today I packaged up my meat like so:After cutting the four equal chunks, I placed each portion in a sandwich size ziploc bag, flattened the meat, squeezed out as much air as possible, and placed them all in a larger bag.I labeled the individual bag with the portion size (in this case it’s just less than a pound).Flattening the meat makes for much less thawing time. In fact, just place the bag in a bowl of COLD water and it takes less than 30 minutes to thaw!You now have your meat ready to make my dad’s “famous” meatloaf…or any other of a variety of options.I’ll share the meatloaf recipe with you later this week, as well as show you how I do this entire process, from frozen ground beef to hot, tasty meatloaf in under an hour.What’s your favorite tip from the kitchen?Hi!

415,"I pin recipes like crazy, and I thought it was high time I make one of them!This one I actually heard on the radio over and over, and it always sounded so good I knew I had to make it.The original recipe comes from Best Foods, but I tweaked it a bit based on what I had on hand. It was sooooo good!Easy Parmesan Crusted Chicken ( I threw the “easy” in there, because it is!)4 chicken breasts 1/2 cup mayo 1/4 cup Parmesan (grated Kraft works fine) 1/2 sleeve Ritz crackers 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp onion powder 1 tsp basil 1 tsp oreganoPreheat your oven to 425 degrees and spray your baking pan with cooking spray. Rinse chicken and pat dry, then place in your pan.Mix mayo and Parmesan cheese in a medium bowl, then spread over chicken breasts.No it does not look pretty at this point, but it’s the same base I use for my spinach-artichoke dip and that stuff is the bomb so I was hoping this would be just as good. And I was oh so right.Next, crush the crackers into fine crumbs (no big pieces) with a rolling pin, add the seasonings and mix. Sprinkle over chicken.I smushed the crumb mixture down just a little.Place the chicken in your preheated oven for about 15-25 minutes. The time really is based on how large the chicken breasts are. Mine were cutlets so they were a little thinner so it only took 15 minutes.This is what they looked like when they came out of the oven. Yum.And this is what they looked like on my plate. Double yum.I served the chicken with parmesan noodles and the kids asked for seconds, which I consider a success!Thanks for stopping by, and I hoe you’ll come back and visit on Saturday when Simply Klassic Sunday goes live!Hi!

416,"One thing I can always count on being able to get my children to eat is grilled chicken. However, I get tired of the same blah chicken over and over. I set out on a mission the other day to find something new. I settled on this recipe, but had to modify it a bit based on what I had available in my kitchen.This fantastically easy chicken dish is perfect grilled on the stove or would be even more delicious on your outdoor grill. The marinade is tangy and sweet. The chicken cooks in the liquid and while it’s cooking the liquid will evaporate and caramelize and will be sooo yummy!The key is not to turn it a bunch of times. Just once is enough and will allow the chicken to cook evenly on both sides without falling apart. When ready to serve, dredge the chicken once more through the pan drippings.Have you tried one of the recipes I’ve shared in the 31 Days series?Hi!

It’s a super simple variation on the old stand-by comfort food.For the chicken, I bought a fully cooked rotisserie chicken and shredded the meat, using half for the soup, and saving the other half for chicken enchiladas later in the week. (tip: I often buy the store made rotisserie chicken, shred and save for quick chicken casseroles, tacos, soups etc. And if you are able to shop late, store usually mark down fresh chicken after 8 pm – I often get mine at half off!).What’s great about this for my family, is that I can add all the extras to mine, and they don’t have to add it to theirs. The boy likes onions, but not carrots, and can’t have soy, and the girl likes carrots, but not onions. So, this worked for all of us!      Hi!
