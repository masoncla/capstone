0,30-Minute Tempeh Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Tempeh Stir-Fry


Everyone needs a good, classic stir fry recipe in their back pocket for quick lunches and dinners, and I think this should be the one.
It comes together in just 30 minutes, uses up leftover grains and vegetables from the week, is rich in protein and fiber, and delivers big flavor. What’s not to love? Let me show you how easy it is to get this dish on the table.

It all starts with marinating the tempeh. Cube your tempeh, mix with your peanut-coconut aminos (or tamari) glaze, and set aside. While that’s happening you’ll prep your other ingredients.


Once marinated, sauté your tempeh on both sides until golden brown and delicious. Then you’ll add your veggies and grains and stir-fry until crispy and browned before adding your tempeh back to the pan to warm. That’s it!


We hope you LOVE this stir fry! It’s:
Quick &amp; easy to make
Incredibly flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Protein- &amp; fiber-rich
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something hearty and nutritious on the table fast. I also love making it for lunch when I want something fast and filling.

","Prepare glaze by adding chili garlic sauce, peanut butter, sesame oil, coconut aminos (or tamari), lime juice, fresh ginger, and maple syrup to a small mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.Add water until a thin, pourable sauce is formed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or coconut aminos for saltiness. Don't be shy — you want this quite flavorful.Add the chopped tempeh to the glaze and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes (or cover and refrigerate up to 24-48 hours). Prep your other vegetables and toppings at this time.Heat a large rimmed cast iron or metal skillet over medium heat. Once hot, spoon in the tempeh, reserving most of the glaze in the bowl (set aside for later). Sauté for 3-4 minutes, turning on each side until browned. Then remove from pan and set aside.To the still-hot skillet add sesame oil, green onion, and mixed vegetables (if adding greens, wait to add until step 6). Season with a bit of coconut aminos (or tamari) and stir to coat. Cover to cook and steam the vegetables, stirring occasionally until slightly golden brown and tender (about 4-5 minutes). If they stick to the pan, add 1-2 tsp of water to loosen.Once the vegetables are nearly done, add your greens and grains and sauté for 3-4 minutes or until warmed through and slightly browned. Then add in the cooked tempeh and the rest of the glaze and stir to coat. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until everything is hot and well incorporated.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. If freezing, store in the freezer up to 1 month. Let thaw before reheating in a hot skillet with a little sesame oil."
1,Simple Green Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Green Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette


Every cook should know how to make a simple side salad and lemon vinaigrette. It’s the easy side dish to pair with just about any entrée, comes together in 10 minutes with simple ingredients, and is incredibly versatile. Let me show you how it’s done.

Start with a base of greens. We went with spring greens, but I also love spinach as a base, as well as thinly sliced kale, arugula, and romaine.

Next comes any vegetable you have on hand. My go-to’s are finely shredded carrot, chopped tomatoes, and onion or shallot. But to make it a little more fancy, I also included pomegranate arils, cranberries, and pepitas.
For even more texture and flavor, you could also consider adding things like my Easy Vegan Parmesan Cheese, Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas or 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese!

Next comes the dressing. Recipes usually recommend adding twice the amount of oil as acid when making vinaigrette. But I find that makes the dressing taste too oily. So I go for more of a 1:1 ratio for better balance, add a little maple syrup to offset the acidity, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
For even more flavor and texture, you can whisk (or blend) in some shallot. Blending it will add more body to your dressing (making it creamier and thicker). Whisking will be more visually appealing as you can see specks of shallot throughout the dressing.

We hope you love and use this side salad all the time. It’s:
Simple
Light
Quick &amp; Easy to make
Fresh
&amp; Customizable
You can pair this side salad with just about any dish. It’s especially delicious with our Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger, Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac ‘n’ Cheese, Easy Gluten-Free Vegan Pizza, andGarlic &amp; White Wine Pasta with Brussels Sprouts.

","First prepare dressing by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl (or small blender) and whisking (or blending) to fully combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, lemon for acidity, or salt or pepper to taste. Set aside.Prepare salad by adding greens to a serving bowl or platter and topping with baby tomatoes, shallot or onion, carrots, pomegranate arils or dried fruit (optional), a pinch of salt and pepper, and toasted pepitas or sunflower seeds.Add dressing to the salad and toss to coat, or serve on the side. Best when fresh. Store salad separate from dressing if keeping for later use. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Store dressing in the refrigerator 3-4 days. The oil can harden when cold, so let set out for a few minutes to warm and shake well to reincorporate before serving leftovers."
2,1-Pot Cauliflower Dal Green Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Cauliflower Dal Green Curry


When winter comes and the nights get cold, I crave comfort food…but I still want my greens. That’s literally where inspiration for this dish came from: “How do I eat so many cooked greens?”
I love this dish because it’s both Indian- and Thai-inspired, using both split mung beans (or moong dal), and my go-to Thai-inspired green curry paste. Let me show you how it’s done!


This 1-pot meal starts with soaked moong dal (a.k.a. split mung beans). While that’s happening, you can prep your fresh green curry paste (or opt for store-bought!) and veggies.

First we start with sautéed shallot, ginger, and garlic before adding the green curry paste, which adds the primary flavor to this dish.
Next comes chopped cauliflower, coconut milk, coconut aminos for depth of flavor, maple syrup for sweetness, and a little lime for acidity.
The soaked moong dal is added and once tender, we throw in a generous amount of greens (I went for kale) and cover to wilt. Then, it’s serving time! It’s that easy.

We hope you LOVE this dish. It’s:
Comforting
Flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Easy to make
&amp; Incredibly satisfying
This would make the perfect hearty meal when you want something nourishing and delicious. It’s tasty as is, or (our preference) served over grains (like rice or quinoa) and garnished with fresh lime and cilantro.

","Add moong dal to a bowl (or pot) and cover with water. Allow to soak for at least 1 hour (to increase absorption and speed cook time), or overnight. Then rinse, drain, and set aside.Heat a large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, shallot, ginger, and garlic. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add curry paste and cook for 1-2 minutes more.Add cauliflower and sauté a few more minutes. Add coconut milk and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Then add soaked drained moong dal, coconut aminos, and maple syrup and stir. Return to a simmer and cook for approximately 15-20 minutes or until moong dal is tender. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, add kale and stir until wilted (about 3 minutes).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding lime juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, coconut aminos or salt for saltiness, or green curry paste for more intense curry flavor. Serve plain like a stew, or over grains like rice or quinoa. Garnish with cashews and lime juice (both optional). Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop. Rehydrate with water or coconut milk as needed."
3,5-Ingredient Golden Milk Snack Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Golden Milk Snack Bites


For a while now, I’ve been wanting to recreate the comforting flavors of golden milk in a portable snack.
I theorized a bar might work, but then remembered how very delicious my no-bake cake bites were and I couldn’t get my mind off of golden milk snack bites.
These 5-ingredientballs are packed with warming, anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric and ginger, naturally sweetened with maple syrup,grain- and gluten-free, and come together in about 20 minutes. Oh, and don’t forget the optional coconut butter swirl and “frosting.” Swoon!
Let me show you how it’s done!

These snack bites start with creamy cashew butter, which I consider one of the more neutral and creamy nut butters, making it an ideal base for this recipe. Need to avoid nuts? Check the ingredients section below for substitution ideas.
Next comes a heaping spoonful of my Golden Milk Mixfor that warming golden milk flavor, and a sprinkle of hemp seeds for added protein and essential fatty acids. Maple syrup adds a bit of natural sweetness, and coconut flour creates a moldable dough with a little added sweetness and coconut flavor.

Next you can add a dollop of coconut butter for a coconut swirl (optional) and then roll into balls. Enjoy straight from the pan, or refrigerate to chill.

I opted to “frost” these with melted coconut butter. But you could leave them plain or roll them in shredded coconut as well!


We hope you LOVE these bites! They’re:
Tender
Naturally sweet
Portable
Perfectly spiced
Quick &amp; easy to make
&amp; Sort of amazing
These would make the perfect on-the-go snack or healthier treat. I’ve been enjoying one with a cup of hot tea in the afternoon—it’s the perfect pick-me-up. While coconut butter is a delicious “frosting,” I could also see a drizzle of melted dark chocolate making these even more indulgent if you want to serve them as dessert.

","Add cashew butter to a medium mixing bowl along with maple syrup, hemp seeds, golden milk mix (or spices*), and salt (optional). Stir to combine.Add coconut flour a little at a time until a firm cookie dough consistency is reached—not tacky, not crumbly, and moldable into balls.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more golden milk mix for spice/warmth, or maple syrup for sweetness.At this point you can add softened/melted coconut butter and stir loosely into the dough for a swirl effect (optional). Otherwise, skip this step.Scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts and gently roll into balls (as the recipe is written, there should be about 12). Repeat until all dough is formed into balls.Enjoy as is, roll in shredded coconut, or refrigerate for 10-15 minutes to chill. If desired, after chilling, top with warmed (melted) coconut butter (see photo), then chill again to set (about 10 minutes).Leftovers will keep stored in the refrigerator up to 1 week (sometimes longer), or in the freezer 1 month."
4,Lemon Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shots | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lemon Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shots


When considering what type of beverage to share for New Year’s Eve celebrations this year, my mind initially went to mocktails. They’re fruity and booze-free—what’s not to love? Well, if I’m honest, I’m not a huge mocktail fan.
Then I thought, “What would be something I’d actually be excited to drink if walking into a NYE party?” Answer:Healthy shots. Call me a grandma, I don’t care. That’s how I roll these days.
Are you with me? If yes, let’s get our anti-inflammatory on.

This 5-ingredient, 5-minute shotstarts with a juicer. However, if you don’t own a juicer fear not. You can easily blend your ingredients in a blender and strain for a similar effect!

Lately I’ve been gravitating toward juice with a high vitamin C content, seeing as it’s flu season. And I’m also always looking for ways to get more turmeric, ginger, and lemon into my system.Why,you ask?
Turmericcontains a compound called curcumin, which boasts amazingantioxidantandanti-inflammatoryeffects. (source)
Gingeris a naturalanti-inflammatory andantioxidantthat’s known toaid digestionandrelieve nausea. (source)
Lemonis naturallydetoxifyingandalkalizingin the body, aids inhealthy bowel movements, and boasts plenty of vitamin C, whichboosts the immune system. (source)
And black pepper helps boost the absorption of turmeric by up to 2,000%. Yes, 2,000! (source)

Once your juice has been extracted, it’s time to add that magical black pepper to the mix and throw one (or two) back.

We hope you LOVE these shots! They’re:
Citrusy
Spicy
Anti-inflammatory
Vitamin C-rich
Immune-boosting
&amp; Super tasty
If you’re into these flavors, I know you’ll love these wellness shots! However, if you’re looking for similar benefits with a less intense bite (the ginger can be intense!), try our 5-Minute Vegan Golden Milk or 3-Ingredient Turmeric Tonic instead.

NOTE: Updates made to improve blender method 1/2/19
","JUICER: To a juicer, add orange, lemon, turmeric, and ginger (depending on the juicer, you may need to peel the orange and lemon - our Hurom does recommend peeling before juicing, so that's what we did). BLENDER: Add turmeric and ginger to a high-speed blender or small blender. We prefer the Nutribullet. Then add the juice of the orange and the lemons (this helps the mixture blend easier, and removes the pulp/rind). A juicing tool like this or this can help! Blend on high for 30 seconds.Add a little water if it has trouble blending but you shouldn't need any. Then strain through a clean thin dish towel, small fine mesh strainer, or nut milk bag. Just be aware that turmeric can stain.FOR SERVING: Divide between serving glasses and enjoy! For maximum benefits, enjoy immediately and top with fresh cracked black pepper. One commenter also recommended adding a little fat to improve turmeric absorption, such as olive oil! FOR STORING: Store any leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 24 hours (though best when fresh).LEFTOVER PULP: You can compost any leftover pulp or freeze into an ice cube try and add to future smoothies. Or, refrigerate and use to steep in things like my Ginger Turmeric Tonic!"
5,How to Cook Brown Rice (2 Ways) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Cook Brown Rice (2 Ways)

If you’ve ever cooked brown rice that turned out gummy, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, join the club. I’ve been there. 
BUT, since my earlier failed attempts, I’ve discovered 2 foolproof ways to cook brown rice that produce perfectly fluffy, tender rice every time. Let me show you how it’s done.

","Optional: Soaking grains helps to remove some of the naturally-occurring phytic acid in the grain, which helps improve digestibility and speed cook time. To soak: Add rice to a large mixing bowl or pot and cover with twice the amount of lukewarm water (1 cup rice + 2-3 cups water). Soak uncovered at room temperature for at least 2 hours or overnight. Then drain and rinse once more. Add water and rice to a medium saucepan. If you soaked your grains, you’ll add 1.5 times as much water as rice, which in this case would be 1.5 cups. If not soaked, you’ll add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil and once boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cover. Cook until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender – about 15-25 minutes (will depend on whether or not the rice was soaked). Drain off any excess water if there is any. I like to turn off the heat and remove the lid for 10 minutes so the rice gets fluffier. Feel free to fluff with a fork at this time as well. Then return the lid to keep warm until serving. This rice is delicious in things like stir fries, sushi, fried rice, with stews, and more!Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a little oil or water until warm.For fluffier rice, start by bringing 12 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, add rinsed rice and stir. Boil on high uncovered for 20 minutes (if soaked) and 30 minutes (if not soaked) or until tender (sample a grain of rice to test doneness). Then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot removed from the heat. Cover with a lid and let steam for 10 minutes. Then serve! This rice is delicious in things like stir fries, sushi, fried rice, with stews, and more!Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a little oil or water until warm."
6,How to Cook Quinoa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Cook Quinoa


Quinoa is such a versatile grain (that’s technically a seed!) that packs a nutritional punch with its high fiber and protein content. 
It’s a great alternative to rice if you’re looking to switch things up. Plus, cooking it is extremely easy, especially with these few helpful tips I’ll share. 
You can choose to soak your quinoa ahead of time to speed cooking time and increase digestibility (see notes!). Or, buy sprouted quinoa at the store to save time (my preferred). 
Let me show you how to make perfect quinoa every time.


","If using sprouted quinoa, add quinoa to a small saucepan and toast over medium heat for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, being careful not to burn. If using quinoa that's not sprouted and you'd like soaking instructions, see notes*. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.Then add salt, curry powder (optional), and water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes or until all water is absorbed. Be sure the quinoa isn't boiling, but cooking at a gentle simmer. Set aside off heat, uncovered, to cool - at least 10 minutes. Then it's perfect for use in things like salads, bowls, falafel, spring rolls, veggie burgers, stir-fries, and more!Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month."

If you’ve ever cooked white rice and it turned out sticky, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, you’re not alone. We’ve all been there.In fact, I used to avoid cooking rice for this very reason, chalking my failures up to not owning a rice cooker. 
However, since then I’ve perfected my go-to method for cooking white rice that’s fluffy, tender, and delicious every time. Plus, it just requires a saucepan and lid (no fancy rice cooker). Let me show you how it’s done.
","Add rice and water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cover. Ensure it's simmering and not boiling or the rice can cook too quickly.Simmer until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender – about 15-25 minutes (will depend on size and freshness of rice). Drain off any excess water if there is any (there shouldn't be).I like to turn off the heat, remove the lid, fluff with a fork and let rest for 10 minutes so the rice gets fluffier and steam escapes. Then return the lid to keep warm until serving. This rice is delicious in things like stir fries, sushi, with stews, and more!Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.

8,Skillet Sweet Potato Hash Browns | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"2-Ingredient Sweet Potato Hash Browns


When testing our Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, I experimented with the best way to turn sweet potatoes into pasta. One such experiment led me to discover that frying them in a skillet makes the perfect hash brown-style sweet potatoes, while steaming yields the best pasta “noodle” texture. The rest is history.
Let me show you this quick and easy method for making perfect sweet potato hash browns every time!

This 2-ingredient, 1-pan, 15-minute recipe starts with preparing your sweet potatoes.
Our preferred method is spiralizing them. But if you don’t own a spiralizer, you can simply grate using a box grater, or use the grater attachment on your food processor to achieve a similar effect.

Once spiralized or grated, simply heat a skillet until hot, add a little oil and your sweet potatoes and seasonings of choice, and pan fry to perfection.
The trick to perfect sweet potato hash brownsis making sure your pan is hot enough to brown the sweet potatoes, while also covering with a lid to create steam so the hash browns get tender on the insides.


We hope you LOVE these sweet potatoes! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Salty-sweet
So easy to make
&amp; Incredibly delicious
These would make the perfect side for your breakfast spread. We picture them being paired with this Chickpea Scramble or Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble. But they would also be tasty with spreads like our 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese and Creamy Hummus from Scratch.

","Spiralize your sweet potatoes into thin noodles using a spiralizer, or grate using a box grater or the grater attachment on your food processor.Heat a large skillet (we prefer cast iron) over medium heat. Once hot, add a little oil and only as many sweet potatoes as will fit comfortably in the pan. If they crowd the pan, they won’t brown as well.Season with a little salt and pepper (optional) and cook for about 5-8 minutes COVERED or until browned on the exterior and tender on the interior. Covering helps the sweet potatoes steam on the interior while still crisping up on the outside.Flip / toss at the halfway point to ensure even cooking. Continue to do this in batches until your sweet potatoes have all been cooked.Enjoy as is, or serve with fresh herbs, hot sauce or ketchup, or your favorite scramble. Best when fresh, but you can store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in a hot skillet for best results."
9,1-Pot Butternut Squash Quinoa Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Butternut Squash Quinoa Chili


Cut through those bitter winter nights with this comforting 1-pot meal that’s easy to make, big on flavor, and made with ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Let’s do this!

This 1-pot recipe starts with the basics: Onion, garlic, pepper. We went for jalapeño for added heat. But if you’re looking to avoid spice, opt for a bell pepper instead!
Next comes the star of the show: Butternut squash!


The flavor comes in waves from spices like chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and a little coconut sugar to balance the heat. And if you’re looking for more depth of flavor and spice, throw in a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce! It’s our “secret sauce” for adding smoky heat to dishes like chili and tortilla soup.
In place of water, I opted for vegetable broth to add even more flavor. Every time I add an ingredient to the pot I think, “What flavor is this adding?” If it doesn’t add any flavor, quite frankly, we don’t have time for that. So, vegetable broth it is!

I threw some quinoa in the mix because I happen to love quinoa, and I appreciate that it adds a little more plant protein to the mix. What’s not to adore?

In the last few minutes of cooking, I threw in some kale, because, nutrients. And that color! Total swoon. And just like that, dinner’s on the table.

We hope you LOVE this chili! It’s:
Hearty
Smoky
Quick &amp; Easy to make
Incredibly satisfying

&amp; Super delicious

10,Easy Pan Roasted Vegetables | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Pan Roasted Vegetables


What’s an easy, elegant side dish? Pan roasted vegetables is the answer.
Roasted vegetables are perfect for just about any meal, holiday or otherwise. But they feel especially cozy and celebratory when paired with things like our Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf” and Easy Vegan Gravy. Perfect dinner much?
Plus, this tutorial shows you:

How to get perfectly tender roasted vegetables every time,
Which seasonings make the flavors pop, and
What sauces pair best with different flavor profiles and styles of dishes.

Shall we?

This recipe requires 1 pan, as the title suggests. I love recipes where you can just throw everything on a pan with the seasonings, toss, and bake! It’swhy I started Minimalist Baker to begin with. Ease, simplicity, no fuss—that’s the name of the game around here.
For this particular batch of veggies, I went with onion, potato, sweet potato, parsnip, beets, and carrots. But really you can throw just about any vegetables you have on hand onto the pan. Just keep in mind baking times.
Baking Times
Starchier root vegetables and onions generally take a bit longer to cook through—generally speaking, about 25-35 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C), while lighter vegetables, such as bell peppers, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli require less—generally speaking, about 20-25 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C). The one exception here is cauliflower, which I find benefits from a longer roast (up to 35-40 minutes).
So, for example, if mixing broccoli and sweet potato, I’d suggest adding the broccoli to the pan at about the 10-minute mark to prevent it from burning.

Let’s talk flavor.
To keep things festive and autumnal, for this recipe, I went with fresh rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper to enhance each vegetable’s flavors, and (the unsung hero) a bit of maple syrup. A little sweetness helps enhance the natural starches in vegetables. I especially love it for sweet potato, onions, and parsnip. But really, it adds a little “oomph” to most roasted vegetables. Salty-sweet just works.
Flavor also comes from a light coating of oil, which helps the veggies caramelize, become tender, and brown in the oven, resulting in that “umami” effect. If avoiding oil, fear not. Check out our Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables tutorial!
Not into herbs? Go for any spice blend—our DIY Curry Powder and DIY Shawarma Spice Blend are instant favorites!



What about sauce?
When it comes to sauce pairings, a)they’re optional. And b) the world is your oyster.
For this batch of vegetables, I went with our Easy Vegan Gravybecause I intended to serve it alongside a healthy helping ofMashed Cauliflower and ourVegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf.”Otherwise, here are a few other pairing ideas that make the most of delicious sauces.
Vegan Crudité, utilizing our 5-minute Macadamia Nut Cheese
Abundance Kale Salad, utilizing our a Savory Tahini Dressing
Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowls, utilizing our go-to Lemon Maple Tahini Dressing
Roasted Squash Salad, utilizing a Balsamic Reduction
Roasted Vegetable Tacos, utilizing our Easy Chimichurri Sauce
Curry Roasted Vegetables &amp; Lentil Salad, utilizing a savory Tahini-Curry Dressing
Rich Red Curry with Roasted Vegetables, utilizing a Rich Curry Sauce

We hope you love these pan roasted veggies! They’re:
Perfectly tender
Flavorful
Versatile
Incredibly easy to make
&amp; a great way to sneak more veggies onto your plate
While delicious on their own, these veggies would pair perfectly with things like our Whole Roasted Cauliflower, The Best Vegan Meatballs, Easy Cultured Vegan Cheese, Baked Quinoa Black Bean Falafel, and Vegan Sloppy Joes.

11,No-Bake Peanut Butter Thumbprint Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient No-Bake Peanut Butter Thumbprints


Friends! I’m so excited to share my new favorite cookie with you just in time for the holidays. They’re so easy to make, ready in 20 minutes,require no baking and just 5 ingredients, and they’re naturally sweetened! Let’s (not) bake!

The base for thesecookies starts with creamy, salted peanut butter sweetened with maple syrup.
For gluten-free flour I used almond flour for its light texture, somewhat “cakey” flavor, and ability to absorb moisture without over-drying (like coconut flour can). While I didn’t test the recipe with other flours, I suspect oat flour, coconut flour (if reduced by half), or your gluten-free blend of choice would likely work.


Once your dough is formed, scoop out golf ball sized amounts and form into balls. Then use your finger or thumb to make an indent. Transfer to the fridge to chill while you make your jam.

To make the jam, all we’re essentially doing is blending up dried fruit and adding a little hot water.
I tested several jam options, including both store-bought jam, fresh chia-raspberry jam, and cooked compote. But none of these compared (see why in the notes) to this simple 1-ingredient blended option! It’s tart and sweet, not too wet, and sits perfectly in the thumbprint!

The jam recipe makes enough for about two batches of cookies, so you’ll have leftovers to use for future cookies and baked goods (think banana bread swirl), on top of oats, or stirred into chia pudding.
Once the jam is dolloped into the cookies, they’re ready to enjoy or chill back in the refrigerator!

We hope you all LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender
Peanut-buttery
Salty-sweet
Easy &amp; quick to make
&amp; Absolutely delicious
These would make the perfect easy cookies to bring to holiday gatherings, cookie swaps, or to just have around the house when you’re craving a healthier treat.

","Add peanut butter to a medium mixing bowl. The peanut butter should be runny when measured. I recommend using natural peanut butter, meaning the ingredients should just be peanuts and salt. Then add maple syrup and stir until well combined. Measure out almond flour and add a little at a time until a workable dough forms (see photo). If too dry/crumbly, add more peanut butter or maple syrup. If too sticky or wet, add a little more almond flour. We added an additional few tablespoons to achieve the right consistency.Scoop dough out in 1 ½ Tbsp amounts (I like using this scoop) and gently roll into balls. Then pick up one cookie at a time and cradle it in your palm. Use your pointer finger or thumb to make an indent, being careful not to press too forcefully to prevent cracking. If the dough cracks, smooth the cracks over before chilling. Continue until all cookies are pressed, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.To make your jam, add dried fruit to a food processor and blend until a ball forms or only small bits remain. Then add warm water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms, scraping down sides as needed. Be careful not to add too much water or the jam will become too wet. We found 2 Tbsp (30 ml) to be the right consistency (as the recipe is written). You’re looking for a paste consistency.Remove cookies from refrigerator and add 1/2 tsp of jam to the center of each cookie. Press down to situate the jam as needed. Repeat until all cookies are filled. You’ll have leftover jam which you can cover, refrigerate, and reserve for future cookies, PB&J sandwiches, or oats!Store cookies well sealed in the refrigerator up to 1 week, or in the freezer up to 1 month (let thaw before enjoying)."
12,Vegan Coconut Snowball Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Coconut “Snowball” Cookies

It’s about that time of year—time to bake cookies all day and lounge in stretchy pants, am I right?
These cookies are a riff off ourEasy Vegan Macaroon Cookies (but somehow even better)! They’re tender, perfectly sweet, and coconut-y, which is why they remind me of snowballs. I couldn’t resist. Let’s do this!

This recipe requires just 7 ingredients, 1 bowl, and less than 30 minutes to make! Yes, baking can be that easy.
It all happens in the food processor where you’ll blend some shredded unsweetened coconut into a fine meal.



Next comes coconut oil for moisture and to help them brown. Maple syrup adds natural sweetness, vanilla a subtle vanilla flavor, and aquafaba more moisture plus binding power!
All that’s left is a little salt to balance the sweetness, and some cornstarch (or arrowroot), which helps add structure and more binding to the cookies. Then, it’s off to the oven.

After a short bake, these little guys are ready to enjoy. Crisp and golden on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. Swoon!
You can dig in right away, or let them cool and dunk or drizzle them in dark chocolate! Either way, it’s a total win-win.

We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Crisp on the outside
Coconut-y
Perfectly (and naturally) sweet
Easy &amp; quick to make
&amp; Seriously delicious
These cookies would make the perfect treat for the holiday table or cookie exchange. Make them even more festive by adding some peppermint extract and topping with crushed candy canes or drizzling with melted dairy-free dark chocolate.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Add coconut flakes to food processor and blend for about 1 minute or a little more, until the coconut flakes start clumping together. When you squeeze some of the coconut in between your fingers, it should stick together like a gritty loose dough (see photo), kind of let wet sand.Add coconut oil, maple syrup, aquafaba, salt, and vanilla and mix for 20 seconds to combine. Add cornstarch and pulse several times to combine until a wet dough has formed (see photo).Scoop out into 1 ½ Tbsp mounds (I like using this scoop) and gently transfer onto your parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving a little room in between each cookie. They can be gentle, so scooping directly from the bowl and placing on the parchment without any additional handling is ideal.Bake for 13-15 minutes, or until tops are lightly golden brown and bottoms appear golden brown. They should puff up a little while baking, too. Be careful not to burn the undersides.Let cool on pan for 10 minutes, then gently transfer to a plate or cooling rack to cool completely. For an optional kick of flavor, you could also dip these in dark chocolate (see method here).These cookies are best enjoyed at room temperature. Store leftovers covered at room temperature for 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month."
13,Easy Vegan Lentil Fesenjān | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Lentil Fesenjān (Pomegranate Walnut Stew)


We’ve been big fans of Fesenjān for years now—ever since John’s aunt introduced us to it at a Persian restaurant in San Diego. Traditionally prepared for special occasions, Fesenjān is perfect for colder months. It’s hearty, comforting, savory-sweet, and so simple to make. Let us show you how!

This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 9 ingredients.
It starts with toasting walnuts and sautéing onions to create a rich and hearty base for the stew. The walnuts are blended into a fine meal and are almost undetectable in the final dish, but add a nuttiness that I just love.

The flavor comes from plenty of warming spices like cinnamon and turmeric as well as vegetable broth and a somewhat uncommon ingredient—pomegranate molasses.
You can find pomegranate molasses at most specialty stores, or—good news—you can make your own (which is what I do). Simply cook down pomegranate juice until thickened and reduced and you’ve got a great homemade substitute.


Though this dish is traditionally cooked with meat, I first began cooking it at home with chickpeas (a recipe you’ll find in our cookbook!). But I must say, lentils and Fesenjān belong together. They become tender in the broth and take on the flavors so incredibly well.I’m hooked!

We hope you LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Hearty
Savory-sweet
Comforting
Warming
Satisfying
Incredibly flavorful
Versatile
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect meal for holidays, hosting, weeknight dinners, and beyond. We love preparing it in the winter months when pomegranates are abundant. Serve over rice and top with pomegranate arils and parsley for the ultimate festive dish.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add walnuts to bare baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, being careful not to burn, just toast. Set aside.In the meantime, if making pomegranate molasses from pomegranate juice, add 1 cup (240 ml) pomegranate juice (adjust amount if adjusting serving size) to small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Continue cooking for about 30 minutes, or until darkened in color and reduced to roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Reduce heat to medium-low if bubbling too vigorously. Once reduced, turn off heat and set aside.Once walnuts are done roasting, let cool slightly then add to food processor or high-speed blender and pulse into a fine meal (see photo). Set aside.Heat an extra-large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat and add water (or oil) and onions. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until soft and translucent.Add vegetable broth and bring to a simmer (starting with the lesser amount and adding more later as needed). Add lentils and stir.Cook uncovered for about 20 minutes, or until lentils are just tender, stirring occasionally. Add more vegetable broth as needed to keep the lentils submerged.Once the lentils are just tender, add walnut meal, pomegranate molasses (start with the lesser amount and work your way up - store-bought can be more intense in flavor), maple syrup, and spices (see photo). Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Then reduce heat to low and continue simmering for 10 minutes, or until thickened and fragrant. Stir occasionally.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more maple syrup or pomegranate molasses for sweetness, salt for saltiness, turmeric for earthiness, or cinnamon for warmth. You can also add more vegetable broth at this time if it’s become too thick.Serve over cooked rice (see notes for instructions) and garnish with pomegranate arils and fresh chopped parsley (optional), or enjoy alone as a hearty stew.Leftovers keep well covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for 1 month, though best when fresh. Reheat on the stovetop until warm, adding vegetable broth to rehydrate as needed."
14,Roasted Stuffed Butternut Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Stuffed Butternut Squash


Are you into roasted squash? What about crispy quinoa, kale, and caramelized mushrooms?
If so, I have just the dish for you! In addition to our new go-to Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf,”I wanted to share another main dish for the holidays (and beyond). Plus, the ingredients happen to be some of my favorites this time of year, so it was just meant to be. Let me show you how easy it is!

This dish requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods to prepare.
It starts by cooking your quinoa and roasting your squash until golden and tender. The squash gets a flavor boost from salt and a little coconut sugar.

Next, you can prepare your balsamic reduction by simply cooking over low flame for 15 until a syrup forms. And all that’s left is sautéing your cooked quinoa, mushrooms, kale, and walnuts (optional). Once your squash is tender, stuff with your quinoa filling and bake another 5 minutes until hot. That’s it!

For garnish we went with our balsamic reduction and our beloved crispy shallot to add a savory crunch to the top. It’s optional but highly recommended and can be prepared while your squash is roasting!


We hope you love this squash! It’s:
Savory-sweet
Super hearty
Easy to make
Customizable
&amp; a delicious main or side!
This would make the perfect entrée or side dish this holiday season, for friend and family gatherings, or a slow weekend treat. (Plus, it reheats beautifully making it perfect for leftovers!) While delicious on its own, we can’t help but want to pair it with our Vegan Garlic Mashed Cauliflower and Easy Vegan Gravy! Talk about the ultimate holiday feast.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and set out a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon liner or grease a 9x13-inch (or similar size) baking dish.In the meantime, if you haven’t already done so, prepare quinoa by adding quinoa and water to medium saucepan and bringing to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 18-20 minutes, or until fluffy and the water is absorbed. Remove lid and let cool completely (uncovered)  on the stovetop.Halve the squash lengthwise (tip and stem) by inserting your knife point into the squash and rocking toward the base. Then remove your knife, flip the squash around 180 degrees and insert the point into the same spot, but rock it toward the stem, pressing down firmly but carefully to split the squash in half.Scoop out seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop. Then brush with oil (or water) and sprinkle with coconut sugar, cinnamon (optional), and salt. Place cut-side down on a lined baking sheet or baking pan.Bake squash for 15 minutes, then flip the squash over to cut-side up. Bake for another 30-45 minutes (sometimes more depending on the size of your squash), or until a knife easily pierces the squash (especially in thicker parts). It's better for the squash to be on the more tender side than firm, in our experience.In the meantime, prepare your balsamic reduction by adding balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan and bringing to a low boil over medium high heat. Once bubbling, reduce heat to a healthy simmer - about medium low heat - and cook for about 12-15 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it’s reduced in volume by about half, it appears syrupy, and it has visible bubbles on the top. Set aside to cool. It will thicken as it cools.Once your quinoa is cooked and cooled, heat a large rimmed metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. One hot, add oil or water and quinoa. Sauté for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly crispy and browned. Season with half the coconut aminos for flavor. Then remove from skillet and set aside.To the still hot skillet add the mushrooms and the other half of the coconut aminos. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and reduced in size. Then add garlic and kale and walnuts (optional) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes or until kale is just wilted. Then add quinoa back to the pan and toss to coat (see photo). Set aside.Once your squash is roasted, place cut-side up on the baking sheet or dish and fill to the brim with quinoa filling. Then place back in the oven to roast another 5 minutes.To serve, arrange on a serving platter or individual plates. We loved garnishing ours with some crispy pan-fried shallot*, parsley, and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. However, this would also pair well with a simple salad dressing like a vinaigrette, tahini dressing, or even Vegan Gravy.Store leftovers covered in the fridge up to 4-5 days. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) until hot."
15,Vegan Garlic Mashed Cauliflower | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Garlic Mashed Cauliflower


Oh, cauliflower – what can’t you do?
You roast to perfection.
You make spicy ‘wings‘.
You can be roasted whole.
You’re delicious in Banh Mi.
You make tacos better (somehow).
Seriously, I think I’m in love.

This 6-ingredient, 30-minute recipe is bound to wow your guests this holiday season (and beyond). Cauliflower mocks mashed potatoes beautifully, and it all starts by steaming your cauliflower until tender.


While that’s happening, sauté garlic in some vegan butter (or olive oil – see notes if avoiding oil / butter). Or, keep your garlic raw for a punchier, stronger garlic flavor!
Once steamed, transfer cauliflower in batches to a food processor (or use an immersion blender) to blend until smooth. You’ll add more salt and pepper to taste, and a dash of dairy-free milk to get a velvety, creamy texture.
Major swoon! We hope you love this dish. It’s:
Easy to make
Hearty and comforting
Simply seasoned
Buttery
Garlicky
&amp; utterly delicious
This would make a beautiful side dish for the holidays and beyond! Top with more fresh garlic, vegan butter, and your favorite fresh herbs to really dress it up. You could even blend in a little nutritional yeast to add cheesy flavor, or vegan cream cheese for more creaminess.

16,4-Ingredient Vegan Easy Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Easy Vegan Brownies


For a while now, I’ve been wanting to make a brownie that is so easy that it can be made quickly, with minimal equipment, and with ingredients I always have on hand. I imagined the texture and flavor I wanted and worked backward from there. And friends, I can’t tell you how happy I am with the results! Let’s make ooey-gooey vegan brownies!


The base of this 4-ingredient, 30-minute, 1-bowl recipe is dates, which create the fudgy texture, naturally sweeten the brownies, and bind the batter as well.
Next comes nut butter. It’s less important which nut butter you use and more important how fresh and creamy it is. When you use peanut butter made with just peanuts and salt, you get a luxurious, creamy texture and it literally pours out of the jar. This is what you’re going for! If you’re peanut-free, I think almond, cashew, or even sesame butter (tahini) would work well here.
After nut butter comes raw cacao powder for rich, chocolate flavor.

Next is a little oil to thin the batter and make the brownies even more fudgy. If you’re oil-free, you could try subbing something like more nut or seed butter, or applesauce.


Once mixed, you can add optional ingredients like dairy-free chocolate chips and raw walnuts! I highly recommend an addition of some kind for texture and added sweetness.

After a short bake in the oven, these little gems are ready! Let cool briefly, slice, and dig in. The amazing thing is they’re delicious warm, room temperature, and cold. So store them at home or take them along with you throughout the day when you need a sweet, energizing snack.

We hope you LOVE these brownies! They’re:
Rich
Fudgy
Easy to make
Naturally sweetened
Super chocolaty
&amp; So delicious
These would make the perfect treat to have on hand when sweet cravings strike. They would also be delicious to share at gatherings or make a lovely gift.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a standard loaf pan (or similar size pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.Add dates to food processor and blend until small bits or a ball forms. If your food processor has a difficult time processing the dates, ensure there are no pits in the dates and that your dates are fresh and sticky. If too dry they can have a difficult time blending. (It may also be an issue of food processor strength if it has a hard time blending.)Once blended, separate the dates into chunks using a spoon. Then add hot water and blend until a sticky date paste forms. Scrape down sides as needed.Add peanut butter, coconut oil, and cacao powder and pulse until a sticky batter forms. It should be tacky and thick (scrape down sides as needed). Lastly add chocolate chips and walnuts (optional) and pulse to incorporate.Transfer batter to lined loaf pan and spread into an even layer. For a smooth top, lay some parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object (like a drinking glass) to press into an even layer.Bake on the center rack for 15 minutes - the edges should be slightly dry. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then carefully lift out of the pan using the edges of the parchment paper and let cool on a plate or cooling rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing. The longer they cool, the firmer they will become.Enjoy warm or cooled. Store leftovers covered at room temperature up to 3 days, in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month (let thaw before enjoying)."

19,Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Perfect Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies


The other day, I was thinking through my rolodex of recipes and realized I don’t have a basic vegan gluten-free chocolate chip cookie on the blog. I KNOW. It’s just wrong. So, obviously, I had to fix that. The rest is history. Friends, ready your aprons and let’s bake!

This 9-ingredient recipe starts with aquafaba! Yes, aquafaba knows no bounds. It acts as a binding and leavening agent in these cookies, which is kind of amazing.
If you haven’t jumped on the aquafaba bandwagon yet (which is just the liquid from a can of chickpeas), you totally should! Don’t dump that liquid gold out next time you’re making hummus! It keeps in the fridge up to a week and makes so many delicious things (like oil-free granola!).


Next comes your dry ingredients, which are organic brown sugar, vegan dark chocolate chips, almond flour (which is key to keeping these light and tender), and our gluten-free flour blend. Add a little coconut oil and vanilla to your whipped aquafaba, combine with the dry ingredients, and you’re halfway there!
These cookies benefit from a brief 30-minute chill before baking. But if you absolutely cannot wait (I mean, like you just can’t), march bravely onward toward baking. I just find they’re easier to work with (and bake better) when chilled.

Friends, you’re going to LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Slightly crisp on the outside
Perfectly sweet
Studded with chocolate chips
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
True story: When we shared these cookies with a friend, she had to hide them from her family because they didn’t trust themselves around the whole batch. Also, they said they were “undetectably” gluten-free. That’s a win in our book!

","In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, dark chocolate chips, gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and organic brown sugar. Set aside.In a separate mixing bowl, beat aquafaba using a handheld mixer until light and fluffy and loose peaks have formed. (Add a little cream of tartar to help them along if not whipping.)To the aquafaba, add the melted coconut oil and vanilla and beat or whisk to combine. Then add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. You should have a firm, semi-tacky dough.  Loosely cover and let chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Scoop out 1 1/2-Tablespoon amounts of dough (I like this scoop) and transfer to your lined baking sheet. Use the palm of your hand to smash the cookies down slightly into small mounds. They won’t spread much, so no need to leave a ton of room between cookies. There should be about 11 cookies (amount as original recipe is written // expect a different yield if altering batch size).Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Be careful not to burn (especially on the bottoms).Remove from oven and let cool on the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully loosen with a spatula and enjoy or continue to let cool.Store cooled leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature up to 4 days or 1 month in the freezer. These are super delicious when warm and dipped in almond milk or hot cocoa!"
20,Caffeine-Free Chai Mix | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Caffeine-Free Chai Mix


In college, I had a chai-a-day habit. In fact, I used to swipe a handful of quarters from my dad’s coin jar (sorry, Dad!) on my way out the door to class to treat myself to a chai at a local coffee shop. There’s something magical about the creaminess of the milk balanced with the subtle sweetness and spice. Swoon.
These days though? I don’t steal from my dad’s coin jar anymore (promise). Nor do I enjoy chai lattes as often, mostly because I try to avoid caffeine. This mix is my answer to that problem. Plus, just 6 ingredients and 5 minutesare required!

This mix is made up of some of my favorite spices: cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, black pepper, nutmeg, and cloves! After much testing of different ratios, this is the perfect blend (in my humble opinion) to create a dreamy chai latte.

Once added to a jar, simply shake or stir to combine. It will keep up to 3 months in your spice cabinet, but if you love chai like me, it won’t last that long by a long shot.
Check out the recipe below for tips on how to make hot and cold chai lattes, as well as other applications for this spice blend!


We hope you LOVE this chai mix! It’s:
Spicy
Warming
Well-balanced
Comforting
&amp; So easy to make
This mix makes the perfect chai latte when cravings strike! Because it’s caffeine-free, it’s suitable for any time of day. But if you want to add some tea, simply cut the amount of dairy-free milk in half and sub that with strong brewed black tea. Sweeten to taste and you’re golden. Pro tip? Add your chai spice mix, sweetener, and warmed milk to a blender to achieve a frothy, hot latte. Swoon!
If you’re into warming beverages, also be sure to check out our Best Vegan Matcha Latte, 3-Ingredient Turmeric Tonic, Feel Good Vegan Hot Chocolate, Vegan White Hot Chocolate, and 5-Minute Vegan Golden Milk(which also has its own Golden Milk Mix now!)!

","To make mix, add all spices to a small jar and shake or stir thoroughly to combine. Will keep at room temperature up to 3 months. Or you can store it in the refrigerator if you prefer. Double the recipe if you intend to use it daily (it goes fast!).To make a HOT chai latte, add suggested amount of Chai Mix, sweetener of choice, and 2 tsp water to a mug (or small blender). Use a spoon to mix spices into water (or skip this step if blending). Then add warmed dairy-free milk of choice to your mug (or blender) and stir (or blend) to combine. The spice mix can settle to the bottom, but blending really helps! Keep a spoon handy to give it a stir when drinking if the spices need to be dispersed.To make an  ICED chai latte, add suggested amount of Chai Mix, sweetener of choice, and 2 tsp water to a serving glass. Use a spoon to mix into a loose paste (you want as few clumps as possible). Then add several big ice cubes and top with dairy-free milk of choice. Stir to combine.In addition to being used to make chai lattes, we also think it would make a delicious spice mix for cookies, vegetables, smoothies, and more!"

The holiday season is upon us and I’ve been dreaming of sharing an easy snack cake to have around if you happen to be hosting family or friends this time of year. You know, the kind of cake that is justifiable as a “snack” or “breakfast” because it has fruit and vegetables in it. Yes! That kind. Let’s bake, shall we?

This 1-bowl recipe starts with a flax egg for binding and mashed ripe banana for some natural sweetness and moisture. Then come tasty ingredients like brown sugar, grated carrots and apples, and cinnamon.


For dry ingredients, we went for a blend of almond meal or flour, oats, and our gluten-free flour blend, which kept the cake fluffy, tender, yet perfectly moist. Chopped walnuts add a bit of crunch and nutty flavor.

After a quick bake in the oven (and the painstaking minutes of letting it cool), it’s time for cake! While delicious on its own, it’s elevated with a simple cashew lemon maple frosting (recipe below)! Swoon.

We hope you LOVE this cake! It’s:
Tender
Flavorful
Packed with fruit + vegetables
Subtly spiced
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect cake to have on hand for gatherings or lazy days spent with loved ones this holiday season. It would also be delicious come spring! Basically, it’s perfect year round for just about any occasion.

","Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl (by mixing water and flax seed and letting it rest for 5 minutes). Also preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line an 8 x 8 inch baking dish or similar size pan. To flax eggs, add olive oil, mashed banana, and maple syrup and whisk to combine. Next add brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon and whisk to combine.Add almond milk and stir. Then add grated carrot and apple and stir.Add oats, baking soda, almond meal (or flour), and gluten-free flour blend and stir to combine (see photo). You should have a thick but pourable batter - add more almond milk to thin if needed or more gluten-free flour or almond meal to thicken.Pour into prepared baking dish and top with crushed walnuts. Bake for 40-45 minutes on a center rack or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongey, so don’t be afraid of over-baking! The GF blend just takes longer to bake than glutenous cakes.Remove from oven and let rest in the pan for 15 minutes. Then gently lift out of the pan and let cool completely on a wire baking rack or flat surface. The longer it cools, the more airy and light the cake becomes.OPTIONAL: While this is happening, you can make your frosting by adding soaked, drained cashews, coconut oil, coconut milk, lemon, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to a high-speed blender and blending on high until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust sweetness or tartness as needed by adding more maple syrup or lemon juice, respectively. Then refrigerate to firm. Wait to frost the cake until frosting has thickened (about 2 hours), and the cake has cooled completely.Store completely cooled leftovers loosely covered at room temperature up to 3 days, 5 days in the refrigerator (if frosted, it does need to be refrigerated), or in the freezer up to 1 month. Best when fresh.

22,How to Cut Butternut Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Cut Butternut Squash


If you’ve ever been intimidated by how to chop butternut squash, fear not. Consider this your step-by-step guide for how to safely and efficiently cut a squash!
It’s easy to follow, works every time, and gets you from whole squash to peeled, seeded cubes in about 5 minutes flat. Let’s do this!




If you try this method, be sure to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see what you do with your squash. Cheers, friends!

","The best way to cut butternut squash is to start with a large, very sharp knife and a sturdy cutting board. To begin, cut off the top stem and bottom end of your squash and discard. Then cut the squash in half where the small, cylinder shape and round, bulb-shape meet.  Use a sharp knife (or a sturdy vegetable peeler) to carefully remove the skin. Alternatively, the skin can stay on because it's edible when roasted! But if adding to a soup (or recipe where it won't be roasted), remove and discard. Remove any seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop. The seeds can be cleaned, washed, dried, and roasted if desired (similar to this tutorial).Cut the squash into small cubes and it's ready for use in recipes like this Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Saucy Butternut Squash Portobello Tacos, or Butternut Squash Hummus!You can use your squash right away, cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, or freeze it in a well-sealed container up to 1 month."

Thanksgiving is right around the corner and it just wouldn’t be right if I didn’t share a cheesy potato dish with you all (like the good Midwesterner I was raised to be).
This recipe is adapted from our Everyday Cooking cookbook(!), is easy to make, and yields a wonderfully creamy, dreamy scalloped potato side dish just in time for the holidays. Shall we?

The base of this 10-ingredient dish is a vegan cheese sauce made with sautéed garlic, cornstarch, vegetable broth, almond milk, and nutritional yeast, which covers thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes before being sprinkled with loads ofvegan parmesan cheese. Swoon!


I love this dish because it’s easy to assemble, you can do other things while it’s baking (like eat chocolate), and it makes you look like a total boss in the kitchen. People won’t believe there’s no dairy!

We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s:
Cheesy
Carbs (!)
Comforting
Savory
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect addition to your menu for the holidays or side dish to bring to gatherings this winter. It just screams comfort!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Heat a large rimmed, oven-safe cast-iron (or metal) skillet over medium heat. We used a 10-inch cast-iron and found it to be perfect for this recipe. Once skillet is hot, add olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until just lightly golden brown.Add cornstarch or arrowroot and whisk to incorporate. Cook for 1 minute.Add almond milk a little at a time, whisking to incorporate. Be sure not to flood pan. Whisk and go slowly to prevent clumps from forming. Continue until all of the almond milk has been added. Then add vegetable broth. Whisk to incorporate.Reduce heat to low. Let simmer for 4-5 minutes to thicken, whisking frequently.Turn off heat and remove skillet from burner. Transfer sauce to blender and add nutmeg, a pinch more salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast.Blend on high until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more nutmeg, salt, pepper, or nutritional yeast to taste. Mixture should be very cheesy and savory to season the potatoes well, so don’t be timid.Lightly rinse out skillet (or grab a similar size baking dish) and generously grease with oil or vegan butter all the way up the sides. Lay down half the sliced potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Then lay flat and sprinkle on 2 Tbsp (10 g) vegan parmesan cheese (amount as original recipe is written // use half of total if altering batch size). Add remaining potatoes, season with a bit more salt and pepper, and loosely toss.Pour sauce over the potatoes and add remaining 2 Tbsp (10 g) vegan parmesan cheese (amount as original recipe is written // use half of total if altering batch size). Push down with your fingers to submerge the potatoes. The sauce should just cover the potatoes, so remove any potatoes that are well above the surface.Cover with foil and bake on middle rack of oven for 20 minutes. Then remove foil and bake for another 40-45 minutes (a total of 1 hour - 1 hour 5 minutes). Potatoes are done when knife inserted into the potatoes comes out without effort and the top is golden brown and bubbly.Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving. As an optional garnish, top with fresh parsley and a dash of paprika for extra color. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a hot oven and rehydrate with more almond milk as needed."
24,"Lentil Nut Vegan ""Meatloaf"" | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf”


Friends, it’s been a long time coming, but my take on a vegan “meatloaf” is here (just in time for the holidays)! And it’s so very delicious. Let’s do this!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and simple methods. I relied on canned lentils (don’t judge) to save time and dishes! Feel free to do the same and proceed to act like you made everything from scratch (I won’t tell).

The base for this loaf is cooked sweet potatoes, mushrooms, lentils, nuts (we went for walnuts and pecans), and fresh thyme. Tomato paste adds moisture and hearty flavor, Worcestershire adds that “umami” effect, and salt and pepper help round everything out. All that’s left is to stir in some gluten-free bread crumbs for texture and transfer to a loaf pan!

For a glaze – I know it’s so basic – we just went with ketchup! It’s simple, and it outperformed more elaborate glazes! Who knew?


We hope you LOVE this loaf! It’s:
Hearty
Satisfying
So flavorful
Comforting
Simple to make
&amp; Incredibly delicious
This would make the perfect entrée or side for the holidays! It’s tasty on its own, but it would be elevated if served with our Easy Vegan Gravy and Perfect Mashed Potatoes! Major swoon.

","Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a standard loaf pan (or 8x8-inch baking pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.Heat a large cast-iron or metal skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add half the oil and mushrooms. Sauté then cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Once softened and reduced in size, add the vegan Worcestershire and stir to coat. Cook for another 3-4 minutes or until caramelized. Set aside.Meanwhile, heat another large cast-iron or metal skillet (or use the same one as you cooked the mushrooms in) over medium heat. Once hot, add the rest of the oil and arrange sweet potatoes in as even of a layer as possible. Then cover and cook for 4 minutes. Flip, add 3 Tbsp (45 ml) water, and cover. Cook for another 3-4 minutes or until tender and browned (but not mushy). Set aside uncovered to cool slightly.To a large (at least 7-cup) food processor, add nuts and pulse a few times into a loose meal. Then add sweet potatoes, mushrooms, and thyme, and pulse to combine. Add lentils, salt, and pepper and pulse to loosely combine but be careful not to purée.Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and add tomato paste and Worcestershire and stir until a loose dough forms. Then add bread crumbs (we like Ian's gluten-free panko) a little at a time (we used all of the recommended amount) until a thick dough forms. If for some reason it’s crumbly (which may happen depending on the texture of your lentils), scoop half of the mixture back into the food processor and pulse until it’s more finely puréed and then return back to the bowl and stir with the remaining mixture. If for some reason it’s too wet, add more bread crumbs as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tomato paste for added moisture / tomato flavor, Worcestershire for depth of flavor, salt for saltiness, or thyme to taste.Transfer the mixture to the parchment-lined loaf pan, spread, and press into an even layer. Then add ketchup glaze (optional) and spread into an even layer. If not using the glaze, brush the top with a little oil to help the loaf retain moisture.Bake uncovered for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown on the edges and slightly dry to the touch. Remove from oven and let rest for 10-15 minutes in the pan. Then gently remove and carefully slice and serve.Leftovers keep for 4-5 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. Reheat in the microwave or in a 350-F (176 C) oven until warmed through."
25,Roasted Squash Arugula Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Squash Salad with Crispy Shallot &amp; Balsamic Reduction


This may be one of my favorite salads to date! And that’s saying a lot considering we have heavy hitters like our Loaded Kale Salad and Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas (both of which are total home runs).
This seasonal salad relies on winter squash, my favorite 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, pepitas, and dried currants for ultimate flavor. And the 1-ingredient dressing? Yeah, it’s that easy (and utterly delicious). Let me show you how.

This salad comes together with 10 ingredients in 30 minutes!
It all starts with roasted acorn squash, which only takes about 10-15 minutes to roast. While that’s happening, start your balsamic reduction (which is simply balsamic vinegar reduced by half until you achieve a dreamy glaze).

Another amazing element to this salad is the crispy sautéed shallot. Simply slice shallot, toss in brown rice flour and salt, and sauté until crispy. It’s pure magic and you’ll never want to eat a salad again without these on top. I promise you.


We hope you love this salad! It’s:
Super flavorful
Fresh
Savory-sweet
Crunchy
Easy (+ quick!) to make
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect side dish for the holidays! Or make it a main by adding our Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas.

","Preheat oven to 425 F (218 C). To prepare squash, use a sharp knife to carefully cut in half lengthwise (from root to tip), then remove seeds with a spoon or ice scream scooper. Slice squash halves into even wedges and leave the skin on.Arrange squash on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with oil, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Spread in an even layer.Roast squash for ~15-20 minutes or until tender and golden brown.In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil. Then allow to simmer until it is reduced by half and looks thick (about 10-15 minutes). Watch carefully near the end as it can go from reduced to burnt quickly. You’ll know it’s done when, swirled, it coats the sides of the pan.At this time, prepare the nut cheese (link to recipe above), or if using store-bought, skip this step.If toasting pepitas, add to a dry skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned - about 3-5 minutes (being careful not to burn).Next, add sliced shallots to a small bowl with brown rice flour, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Heat a medium (preferably cast-iron) skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and floured shallots and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown and crispy - ~5 minutes.To serve, arrange arugula on a platter or serving bowl and top with roasted squash, crispy shallots, dollops of macadamia nut cheese, pepitas, and cranberries or currants.

26,Easy Vegan Gravy | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Gravy


We’re inching closer to Thanksgiving and I couldn’t leave you all hanging without a good gravy recipe.
For a while now, I’ve been dreaming up this version, which utilizes dried mushrooms for a richer, more intense flavor and color, and it seriously paid off. Let me show you how easy it is!

This 9-ingredient, 15-minute recipe starts by rehydrating dried mushrooms in vegetable broth. We went for porcini because their flavor is more woodsy and intense. But you can sub whatever mushrooms you’d like (or use fresh – see notes).
While that’s happening, start sautéing onions and garlic in a saucepan. For thickener, I went for cornstarch, but you could also sub a gluten-free flour blend, all-purpose flour, or arrowroot starch. Stir to coat and cook for a couple of minutes to deepen the color and flavor.

Next, you’ll add in your rehydrated porcini mushrooms and the vegetable broth as well as fresh herbs. We went for rosemary and thyme to keep things classic. But play with whatever flavors sound best to you.
After a few pulses in the blender (or an immersion blender), this gravy becomes deep caramel in color and creamy smooth!


We hope you all LOVE this gravy! It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Earthy
Versatile
Customizable
Easy to make
&amp; Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect sauce for just about any holiday or special occasion meal. We found that it paired incredibly well with a mound of creamy mashed potatoes and a sprinkle of fresh parsley.

","Rehydrate dried mushrooms in vegetable broth in a large saucepan or pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once bubbling, turn off heat, cover, and let rest.In the meantime, heat a large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and onion and sauté for 5 minutes. Then add garlic and sauté another 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.Add cornstarch and stir to coat. Then cook for 2 minutes more. Next add herbs and mushrooms with their broth (reserving a little of the broth so you can play with the thickness) and stir to combine (see photo). Cook for 2-3 minutes.Transfer gravy to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and blend until smooth and creamy. You can leave some of the onions or mushrooms unblended for more texture. Then transfer back to your pan and warm over low heat for 2-3 minutes more. At this time, you can add a bit of almond milk to lighten the color and flavor a bit (optional), but we opted not to. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper to taste. If gravy is too thin, scoop out a small portion of the gravy and whisk in 1-2 tsp more of cornstarch until no clumps remain. Then add it back to the larger batch - repeat as needed until desired thickness is reached. If too thick, thin with a little of your reserved vegetable broth.Serve with dishes like mashed potatoes, biscuits, and more! Store completely cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a saucepan until hot and bubbly, adding more vegetable broth to thin as needed. "
27,Moroccan Eggplant and Tomato Stew | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Moroccan-Spiced Eggplant and Tomato Stew


Friends, I’ve been dreaming of this dish for so long and it’s finally here (after much toil and experimentation).
Whenever we travel abroad, I always try to order eggplant dishes because I love seeing how other cultures prepare eggplant.I try to study the spice mixtures and cooking methods to see how they create such delicate, perfectly seasoned dishes.
This recipe is a hearty stew inspired by the flavors of a Moroccan dish called zaalouk – which is a warm salad of cooked eggplant and tomato. I added chickpeas to mine (optional) to make it more of an entrée. Served over rice, it’s near perfection.
My version is certainly inspired, and I loved experimenting with the concept of zaalouk to create something that made my taste buds sing (and hopefully yours, too).

This 10-ingredient dish starts with eggplant that’s cubed and roasted until golden brown. While that’s happening, onion and garlic are sautéed with smoky spices like paprika and cumin and then stewed in fire-roasted tomatoes.
Maple syrup balances the dish with a little sweetness while harissa paste adds a spicy, smoky flavor. All that’s left to do is add your chickpeas and let it simmer.


We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Smoky
Perfectly spiced
Easy to make
&amp; SO satisfying
This would make the perfect dish for slow weekend dinners, or you could make it ahead of time to enjoy throughout the week! We loved it served over rice, but it would also be delicious over quinoa, steamed greens, roasted vegetables, or cauliflower rice.

28,Vegan Baked Apple Cider Donuts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Apple Cider Donuts


Hi, friends! Fall is in full swing over here in our part of the world, so naturally, we have one thing on the mind: comfort food. And nothing spells comfort food like these baked apple cider donuts. Consider them a hug from fall. Let’s bake!

This 30-minute recipe starts with aquafaba!
Aquafaba is the liquid from a can of chickpeas, which whips nicely and mimics the properties and texture of egg whites. This not only acts as a binder but also helps the donuts stay light and fluffy!
Once whipped, set aside and prepare your simple batter, which is comprised of wholesome ingredients like almond flour, maple syrup, coconut sugar, and our gluten-free flour blend.
These donuts get infused with apple flavor two ways: 1) applesauce, and 2) apple cider! Throw in some warming fall spices like cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg into the mix and it’s like a baked apple dream.

﻿
After a short bake in the oven, it’s time to invert and let cool slightly to firm up.
At this time, you can brush your donuts with melted vegan butter (or coconut oil) and dunk them in a cinnamon-sugar mixture! This adds a little more texture as well as sweetness and warmth. Swoon!

We hope you LOVE these donuts! They’re:
Fluffy
Tender
Naturally sweetened
Perfectly spiced
Infused with apple
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect slow-weekend breakfast treat. Or you can make them in advance to enjoy throughout the week with coffee, this Healing 3-Ingredient Turmeric Tonic, or aMatcha Latte!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and grease two 6-slot (or one 12-slot) donut pans*.To a small mixing bowl, add aquafaba and use a mixer (or whisk) to vigorously blend until soft peaks form - about 1-2 minutes if using electric mixer. Set aside. (If yours doesn’t quite whip up into soft peaks, it’s OK. Just get them as fluffy as possible! A sprinkle of cream of tartar helps them firm up.)To a large mixing bowl, add the oil, cane (or coconut) sugar, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, sea salt, ginger, and nutmeg and whisk vigorously to combine. Then add applesauce and apple cider and whisk once more to combine.Add almond flour, gluten-free flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk gently to combine. Lastly, add in the whipped aquafaba and gently fold in, trying to be as gentle as possible (see photo). If the batter appears too thin at this point, add 1 Tbsp each almond flour or gluten-free flour at a time until it thickens up. It should appear like a thick cake batter - semi-thick and more scoopable than pourable.Divide batter evenly between donut tins, filling all the way full but leaving room for the center hole to be exposed (this can be done using a piping bag, Ziploc bag with the corner cut off, or just a spoon). There should be 11-12 donuts (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Optional: Sprinkle the donut batter with coconut sugar and cinnamon before baking.Bake for about 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, the edges appear brown, and the tops appear dry and fluffy. Time will vary depending on oven and if you subbed ingredients.Optional: In the meantime, melt vegan butter (or coconut oil) in a small dish and prepare cinnamon-sugar coating by adding cane or coconut sugar and cinnamon to a small dish and stirring to combine. Set aside.Remove donuts from oven and let cool for a few minutes in the pan. Then grab the tins with a towel and tap over a cooling rack to loosen the donuts until they fall out. Let cool (smooth side up - the side that was in the tin) for at least 5 minutes on the rack. The longer they cool, the more they'll firm up!Optional: While cooling or once cooled completely, brush the donuts with a light coating of melted vegan butter (or coconut oil) and dip in or sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar coating.Best when fresh. Store completely cooled leftovers loosely covered at room temperature up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
29,Caramelized Shiitake Mushroom Risotto | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Caramelized Shiitake Mushroom Risotto


When you’re craving carbs and comfort, risotto is your dish. We’ve made risotto a couple times for the blog before and you all seem to love it. So, with my newfound love for caramelized mushrooms, I couldn’t have imagined a better way to serve up a new spin on risotto. Shall we?

The base for this 10-ingredient, 30-minute recipe starts with warmed vegetable broth, which you can make yourself (for the win), or just grab some store-bought (our favorite brand is Imagine).
Next come shallot and shiitake mushrooms, which are sautéed until golden brown. Ideally, the mushrooms start to dry out a little and become deep golden brown and caramelized for the ultimate hearty mushroom flavor.
Caramelization happens when the mushrooms have plenty of space to touch the pan without overlapping, so use your largest pan or pot to ensure they have plenty of room to swim.


Once caramelized, it’s time to add your rice, some white wine, and fresh herbs. This is where the flavor begins to really develop.
Lastly, add vegetable broth a little at a time, keeping a consistent low simmer and stirring frequently until the rice achieves an “al dente” texture – soft with a little bite.

Once the rice is done, turn the heat off, add your vegan parmesan cheese (or just some nutritional yeast or other vegan cheese of choice), and stir to combine.
Mmm – cheesy, hearty carbs.

We hope you LOVE this risotto! It’s:
Hearty
Cheesy
Extremely flavorful
Comforting
Easy to make
Customizable
&amp; So delicious
This would make a great weeknight meal when you’re craving something comforting and nourishing and need it on the table fast. It would also be great for hosting, especially when paired with something like our Best Vegan Meatballs, Best Whole Roasted Cauliflower, Vegan Ricotta Sun-dried Tomato &amp; Pesto Salad, and your favorite red or white wine.

","In a medium saucepan, heat vegetable broth over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep warm.In the meantime, heat a large pan* over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and shallot and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for 3-4 minutes - stirring frequently. Then add mushrooms and coconut aminos and continue sautéing until the mushrooms are golden brown and caramelized. Optional: remove some of the shiitake mushrooms from the pan and reserve for serving - not necessary, but it makes a nice garnish.Add the thyme and arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Then add dry white wine and stir gently. Cook for 2 minutes or until the liquid is mostly absorbed.Using a ladle, add warmed vegetable stock 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer (adjust heat as needed). You want the mixture to be cooking consistently but not boiling or it can get gummy and cook too quickly.Continue to add vegetable stock 1 ladle at a time, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is 'al dente' - cooked through but still has a slight bite. This whole process should take about 15-20 minutes.Once the rice is cooked through and al dente, remove from heat and add vegan parmesan cheese. Stir to coat (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding sea salt and pepper to taste or more vegan parmesan to enhance the cheesiness. If dry at this point, add a little more warmed broth.To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with reserved mushrooms, additional vegan parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of fresh parsley (all optional).Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 4-5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop with additional (warmed) vegetable broth until hot."
30,Raw Vegan Carrot Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Carrot Cake with Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting


It’s here: the raw cake of my dreams. Raw Vegan Carrot Cake!
It’s tender, it’s cakey, it’s naturally sweetened, it’s topped with an optional but swoon-worthy vegan cream cheese “frosting,” and it’s all yours in just 10 basic ingredients and 30 minutes. Let’s do this!

The base of this cake starts with blended dates and walnuts. Then we add shredded carrots and plenty of vanilla and spices for added warmth and flavor.
Once blended, transfer to a bowl to stir in the coconut flour to keep a lighter, cake-like texture. Coconut flour adds natural sweetness and lots of healthy fiber, and it also keeps this cake grain-free!

﻿
Once your cake dough is formed, you can either roll into balls (like these No-Bake Vanilla Cake Bites!) or form into a cake using a cake pan, baking pan, or (our preferred) springform pan.
For the (optional) frosting, we went with a cheesecake-inspired cashew cream flavored with lemon for acidity, maple syrup for natural sweetness, and vanilla. The result is a luxurious, cream cheese-esque frosting that sits thick on top of the cake. Major swoon!

Once the cake is chilled, it’s party time. Garnish with whatever you’ve got on hand (we went with some flowers, carrots, and walnuts) and dig in!

We hope you LOVE this cake! It’s:
Tender
Naturally sweetened
Packed with carrots
Perfectly spiced

","If making the frosting (optional), soak the cashews in hot water for 30 minutes - 1 hour. Then rinse and drain. Add to a high-speed blender along with coconut cream, lemon juice, maple syrup, and vanilla and blend on high until very creamy and smooth scraping side as needed. Cover and refrigerate to chill.Using a box grater or the grater attachment on your food processor, grate the carrots and set aside.To a large (at least 7-cup) food processor, add the pitted dates and blend until small bits remain or a ball forms. Remove from food processor and set aside. (Smaller food processors can be used - the ingredients just need to be blended in batches as to not overflow the bowl.To the food processor, add the walnuts, vanilla, salt, and spices. Blend until a semi-fine meal is achieved. Then add dates back in, along with shredded carrots, and pulse in 1-second measurements until a loose dough forms and the carrots are just incorporated. Be careful not to over-blend. You're looking for a pliable dough, not a purée.Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add coconut flour and raisins and stir to combine. By mixing gently as opposed to blending in a food processor, you can keep a lighter, less dense, more ""cake-like"" texture. Once well combined, set aside.Prepare a 7-9 inch springform pan (or large cake pan or an 8x8-baking dish with high edges) by adding parchment paper along the bottom and sides. Then add the cake mixture, and spread and press down evenly to pack. Use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to help press everything into an even layer. If the mixture sticks to the glass, wrap it in parchment paper. (NOTE: You could also scoop and roll these into balls to enjoy as cake bites!)At this point, you can enjoy the cake by carefully lifting or sliding the cake out of its pan. However, if adding the frosting, pour the frosting on and tap out any air bubbles. Then place on a baking sheet (to keep level) and freeze for 3-4 hours or until the frosting is semi-firm to the touch.To serve, make sure the cake isn't fully frozen so it's soft enough to cut (letting it thaw on the counter for 30 minutes should help). Then use a hot knife to carefully cut out slices and enjoy. Garnish with more nuts, raisins, or other desired toppings (all optional).Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month. It's best enjoy slightly chilled (not frozen). You can let it sit out at room temperature up to 2 hours, but the frosting can begin to get soft."
31,Simple Vegan Tortilla Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Vegan Tortilla Soup


When visiting Mexico City recently, we ate so much delicious food that my brain was bursting with ideas by the time we got home.
One of my main goals was to perfect a (vegan) chicken broth-like tortilla soup with vegetables and jackfruit. I suppose you see where this is going? Let’s make soup, friends.

This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and 1 pot to make.
It starts with sautéed onion and garlic, which get caramelized and tender. Then we add the jackfruit (which mocks chicken) and cook until lightly browned to create texture and flavor.
Next comes chipotle peppers, smoky spices, and vegetable broth. We’re onto something good, friends.

Simply let simmer until slightly reduced and toast your tortilla strips (or, if you’re like us and feelin’ lazy, use your favorite tortilla chips)!


We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s:
Brothy
Smoky
Savory
Subtly spiced
Easy to make
Comforting
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect side or appetizer on Mexican night. We love garnishing ours with toasted tortilla strips (or chips), fresh avocado, a little lime and cilantro. Swoon!

","Thoroughly rinse and drain jackfruit. Then begin sorting. The pieces come in chunks or triangle shapes. Cut off the center ""core"" portion of the jackfruit that's tougher in texture and separate it from the rest of the fruit. Then chop into smaller pieces. For the remaining portion of the jackfruit that appears more stringy, use your hands (or two forks) to pull into small shredded pieces. You're aiming to separate the jackfruit into small, shredded/chopped pieces. Rinse the jackfruit once more in a colander, drain, and thoroughly dry. Set aside.Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add vegetable broth, diced onion, and minced garlic. Saute, stirring occasionally for 3-5 minutes or until onions are translucent.Add rinsed and shredded jackfruit and saute for 4-5 minutes to get some color and dry out jackfruit.Add chipotle peppers, salt, and cumin. Saute, stirring frequently, for 3-4 more minutes. Add the remaining vegetable broth and bring back to a low boil. Then reduce heat and simmer for at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sea salt for saltiness, cumin for smokiness, or chipotle peppers or adobo sauce for heat. Once seasoned to taste, turn heat off to rest soup before serving.In the meantime, heat oven to 380 degrees F (190 C). (If using tortilla chips, you can skip this step.) Cut corn tortillas into bite-sized strips and transfer to a baking sheet. Add 2-3 tablespoons of avocado oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and toss to coat (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Arrange in a single layer on a baking pan and bake for 10-15 minutes or until they are golden brown. Watch carefully toward the end or they can burn!To serve, place tortilla strips or chips in serving bowls, top with soup, and garnish with desired toppings such as avocado, cilantro, lime wedges (optional). Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Store any leftover tortilla strips at room temperature up to 2-3 days."
32,Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal


Behold: Autumn in a dish. Those colors, those flavors – swoon.
It has so many of my favorite ingredients, like oats, pumpkin, cinnamon, and maple syrup, and bakes up so beautifully. Consider this dish your 1-bowl go-to when oatmeal cravings hit. Let’s bake!

This dish begins with flax eggs. Then we add pumpkin puree, maple syrup, pumpkin spices, and a little oil (for moisture and to help crisp the edges). This creates the base, and then we add dairy-free milk which will ultimately soak and help bake the oats!

Once the milk is blended, you’ll add your oats and pecans and stir to saturate. Then simply transfer to a dish, top with additional toppings (optional), and bake! It’s that easy. I know – exciting stuff.


We hope you LOVE this oatmeal! It’s:
Comforting
Warming
Naturally sweet
Subtly spiced
Easy to make
Wholesome
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast to feed the family – one batch makes six hearty servings! Or you can prepare the oats up until the baking stage, refrigerate overnight (which will make the oats super tender and creamy!), and bake in the morning, which makes it totally doable for weekday breakfasts as well.

35,How to Make Arepas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Arepas (3 Ingredients!)


We have a serious thing for the Portland restaurantTeote. It’s Latin American-inspired and celebrates the arepa in all forms.
I’d never had an arepa before dining there, but since that first bite, I’ve been back almost weekly. (It doesn’t hurt that they have a killer vegan bowl there, which inspired this Vegan Black Bean Plantain Bowl!)
I started testing arepas of my own recently, but all of my attempts fell slightly short of Teote’s glory. So I did what any sane, normal human would do: I called them and asked for their recipe. And guess what? They basicallygave it to me. Well, at least their secrets. And I totally ran with them.
So this, my friends, is it. The key to unlocking perfectly flavorful, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-and-fluffy-on-the-inside arepas! Let’s do this.

This recipe requires 30 minutes, 1 bowl, and just3 ingredients: salt, water (which we don’t count as an ingredient), oil for cooking, and areparina or masarepa, which is a special pre-cooked corn flour specifically for making arepas.
I know what you’re thinking: “I’ll just use cornmeal.” Not the same.
Or you’re thinking, “I’ll just use masa harina.” Not the same.
Trust me – I did lots of testing with many different corn flours and the results were clear: Masarepa (a.k.a areparina) is the only way to go! Plus, once you master this recipe, you’ll be making arepas all the time, so it’s a handy ingredient to have around.


The process is simple: Dissolve salt into the water and slowly add the masarepa until a loose dough forms, stirring with a spoon or your hands.
I use my hands because, when Colombian and Venezuelan grandmas use their hands, you follow suit.

Now, the Teote secret lies in two deviations:
1) Mixing both white and yellow masarepa (which I also recommend doing, as it creates a nice golden color but a light texture and a slightly less bitter flavor).
and
2) Deep frying (no wonder they taste so good). We did opt for pan frying and then baking to cook the middle all the way through, but by all means, fry away if you want!

Once you get your dough where it should be, let it rest for 5 minutes. Then scoop out fist-size portions and form into a ball.
If the edges crack easily or it feels too dry, add a little more water to moisten. It’s a simple dough to work with. Then it’s as easy as rolling into balls and gently forming / smashing into discs.

Once your arepas are formed, simply pan-fry in a little oil to form a crust (a little deep blackening is OK!), and then finish in the oven to ensure the centers are cooked through (optional but recommended). Then enjoy!

We hope you all LOVE these arepas! They’re:
Crispy on the outside
Tender on the inside
Savory
Satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; SO versatile
Arepas can be enjoyed plain, on the side of dishes like our Plantain Black Bean Bowl, or cut into a “pita pocket” and stuffed with just about anything, including rice, Black Beans,Vegan Barbacoa, Jackfruit Taco ‘Meat’, or Guacamole (the options are endless). You could also enjoy them with a little vegan butter and maple syrup as a special treat. Mmm.
If you’re into arepas, also be sure to check out our Fluffy Cornmeal Pancakes, Perfect Vegan Cornbread, and Blackberry Cornmeal Muffins! And stay tuned, as we have an arepa sandwich coming up that’s gonna blow your minds.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Set out a baking sheet and line with parchment paper. And to a large mixing bowl, add water and salt. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. A little at a time, add the areparina and stir with a whisk or your hands (our preferred method). You may work your way all the way up to two cups, although we typically have 1-2 Tbsp leftover. You’re looking for a dough that doesn’t easily stick to your hands, is moldable and moist, and can be rolled into a ball. Once you have that consistency, cover with a towel for 5 minutes. We did mix both white and yellow areparina as inspired by Teote (optional). Uncover, grab a large handful of dough, and roll into a ball (as the recipe is written, our batch made 6 large arepas, but it could also make 8-10 smaller arepas). Carefully press the ball between the palms of your hands to form into a roughly 1/2-inch thick disc. If it cracks a lot on the sides, your dough may need 1-2 (15-30 ml) more water. A little cracking is OK - just use your hands to close the cracks by gently patting along the edges (see photo).Once the arepas are formed, heat a large cast-iron or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a little oil and swirl to coat. Then add arepas, giving them a little room in between so they don’t touch. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until deep golden brown (a few blackened spots are OK). You're looking to form a crust. Then flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more or until the underside is also browned.Transfer to your parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes or until slightly puffed up and a little more golden brown in color. Some people like to slice into them immediately, but I find they can be a little doughy in the middle at that stage, so I prefer to let them cool for 5-10 minutes and serve while they're warm but not piping hot.To enjoy, slice in half and enjoy as is, spread both sides with vegan butter and a little maple syrup (YUM), or cut the arepa 3/4 of the way around, leaving a seam on the edge so you can “stuff” it like a pita. Fillings could include everything from black beans to rice to guacamole or even our Vegan Barbacoa!Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month (cooked or uncooked). Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through. If reheating frozen uncooked arepas, I'd recommend letting them thaw first and cooking them as instructed."
36,Easy Vegan Ranch Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Ranch Dressing (Oil-Free!)


Being from the Midwest originally, we certainly have a special place in our hearts for ranch dressing. When we were growing up, it was a common dressing for salads and basically the only way we would eat vegetables.
If you take a look at the ingredients of ranch dressing at the store, you’ll notice lots of dairy, processed oils, and other not-so-fresh ingredients. Let’s fix that and make our own!

This 10-ingredient, 1-bowl recipe is made with items you likely already have on hand: cashews, lemon, spices, vinegar, and herbs.
It starts with soaked cashews for the ultimate creamy base. We tested hemp seeds but found their flavor a little overpowering. So good ol’ cashews it is!

While the cashews are soaking, you’ll make “vegan buttermilk” with almond milk and lemon juice. Then simply add everything to a blender with your spices and herbs and you’re golden! Enjoy right away or chill to thicken.


We hope you LOVE this ranch dressing! It’s:
Creamy
Tangy
Herbaceous
Satisfying
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect sauce for salads like our Loaded Kale Salador for dipping fresh or roasted vegetables in! It would be especially tasty with spicy things like our Buffalo Chickpea Wrap, and Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower Wings!

","Soak cashews in very hot water for 30 minutes -1 hour (or overnight in cool water). While cashews are soaking, measure out almond milk and add lemon juice and set aside to curdle (this makes your vegan “buttermilk”). Drain and rinse cashews several times and drain again. Then transfer to a small blender (a blender is preferred over a food processor for achieving a smooth texture) and add almond buttermilk, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, vinegar, and maple syrup. Blend on high for 1-2 minutes or until very creamy and smooth. Add herbs and pulse several times to incorporate (you don’t want it fully puréed). Taste and adjust flavor, as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, maple syrup for sweetness, lemon juice or vinegar for acidity, garlic for garlic flavor, or herbs for a more herbal flavor.Use immediately at room temperature or refrigerate for 3-4 hours to chill. It will thicken in the refrigerator, so you can add more almond milk or water later on to thin if needed. Enjoy with vegetables, salads, cauliflower wings, or pizza! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 7-10 days. Not freezer friendly (will likely separate upon thawing)."
37,Socca Pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Pesto | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Socca Pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes &amp; Pesto


Now that we’ve discovered how delicious socca is, let’s make pizza!

This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl to make and comes together in about 1 hour.
The reason I love this recipe so much is it’s like eating pizza but without all the bread and grains. That’s right, it’s grain-free!

It starts with socca batter infused with garlic and nutritional yeast for flavor (oregano is optional!). Baking powder provides a little rise, but not so much that the edges don’t get browned and a little crisp.
For toppings, we went with red onion, sun-dried tomatoes, vegan macadamia nut cheese, and vegan pesto. But really, whatever you have on hand will work!



We hope you LOVE this pizza! It’s:
Flavorful

","In a medium mixing bowl, add garbanzo flour, sea salt, baking powder, garlic powder, and nutritional yeast and whisk to combine. Then pour warm water into dry ingredients and whisk until smooth (add the water slowly, and if it starts to look too runny - it should be a thin but not a watery crepe-like consistency - refrain from adding all the water). Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.In the meantime, heat oven to 425 degrees F (204 C). Once the batter has rested, add the olive oil and oregano (optional) and stir to combine.Heat a large (12-inch) oven-safe cast-iron or metal skillet over low-medium heat (if using a smaller skillet, this will make two small pizzas instead of one large pizza). If using a non-stick pan or a cast-iron that's seasoned, it shouldn’t need more oil. But if your pan tends to stick, add a little oil - it won’t hurt.  Add the chickpea batter into the greased, hot skillet and move the pan around to allow batter to flatten like a large pancake, leaving a little room on the very edges of the pan to allow room for a spatula to slide under. Add onion and cook for 1 minute. Then carefully transfer skillet to the oven and bake 10-15 minutes or until bubbles have formed, the edges have browned, and the top is slightly golden brown.Remove from oven after baking, gently loosen with a spatula, and slice on a cutting board (or slice right in the pan). Then add remaining toppings of choice. We went with chopped sun-dried tomatoes, macadamia cheese, arugula, raw chopped garlic, and vegan pesto. Vegan parmesan and/or red pepper flake can also make nice additions.Best when fresh. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot (arugula does not reheat well)."
38,Cauliflower Vegan Banh Mi Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Banh Mi


Friends, behold: The Vegan Banh Mi Sandwich.
Consider this my spin on the popular, classic Vietnamese sandwich. So many versions I’ve seen rely on tempeh or tofu as the main filling. But I couldn’t help but wonder if the humble cauliflower could step in and take its place, because it’s fast to prepare, absorbs flavors well, and is so delicious when stir-fried. Spoiler alert: It totally worked.

This recipe comes together in 30 minutes! Yep, that fast, which means it’s lunch- and dinner-friendly (quick meals for the win).
It starts by quick-pickling radish and carrot in vinegar, a little salt, and sugar. This makes them crispy, salty, tangy, and a little sweet. Next comes the main event: the cauliflower.

First, we marinate it in a simple spicy, savory sauce. Then we sauté and finish by roasting in the oven until tender. Mmm, roasty.


Once the 3-ingredient sriracha mayo is made and the bread is toasted, it’s time to assemble! First aioli, then cauliflower, then pickled vegetables and garnishes. That’s it!

We hope you LOVE this sandwich. It’s:
Hearty
Crunchy
Savory
BIG on flavor
Quick to make
&amp; SO satisfying
This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving a sandwich but want something more thanPB&amp;J. It’s the perfect marriage of textures, temperatures, and flavors. Enjoy as is or pair with these Vietnamese-inspired Spring Rolls!

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Prepare pickled vegetables first by adding vinegar, hot water, salt, and sugar (or stevia) to a glass jar and shaking or stirring vigorously to dissolve salt and sugar. Then add carrot and radish, stir to coat, and push down to submerge. Cover and place in the refrigerator to chill, where they will ""quick pickle"" until sandwich is ready. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week (sometimes more).To a medium mixing bowl, add chili garlic sauce, coconut aminos (or tamari), maple syrup, lime juice, and oil and stir to combine. Then add cauliflower florets and toss to combine.Heat a large rimmed oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, use a slotted spoon to scoop the cauliflower into the pan, reserving most of the liquid in the bowl.Sauté, stirring semi-frequently, until slightly browned on the exterior. Then add most of the reserved marinade (saving a little for serving) and toss to coat. Transfer pan to the oven and bake until crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside - about 15 minutes.In the meantime, prepare aioli by adding vegan mayo to a small mixing bowl with maple syrup and sriracha. Stir to combine. Then sample and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sriracha for heat or maple syrup for sweetness. Set in the refrigerator until serving.Slice the baguettes in half and toast in the oven (facedown directly on the oven rack) or on a hot grill pan until slightly browned. Then assemble: To the baguette, add aioli to both sides of the bread. Then to one side, add the cauliflower and brush on any leftover cauliflower marinade for more flavor. Last, add pickled vegetables, cilantro (optional), cucumber (optional), and jalapeño (optional).Enjoy. Best when fresh, though can be made in the morning and enjoyed for lunch - just refrigerate to keep fresh. Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator (except any un-toasted bread) up to a few days. Not freezer friendly."
39,Simple Buckwheat Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Everyday Buckwheat Granola

Hey friends! Ready for a bowl of tasty, wholesome, everyday granola?
Buckwheat is one of those elusive ingredients that intimidated me when I first learned about it, but the more I cook with it, the fonder of it I become (it’s especially great in our Buckwheat Crepes!). It’s wholesome, gluten-free, and versatile, and it provides a delicious nutty flavor. Plus, it makes extra-crunchy granola, which happens to be my thing. Let’s bake!

This granola is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients to make. It starts with an even mixture of oats and buckwheat groats, but you can easily use all buckwheat groats if you prefer (I just prefer mixing the two for some texture).
Next come nuts and coconut, a little cinnamon for warmth, and coconut sugar and maple syrup for natural sweetness.

This granola cooks a little longer at a lower temperature to get an even golden-brown color and super-crunchy texture. This is what we call granola perfection. I wish you could smell it through the screen (swoon).


We hope you LOVE this recipe. It’s:
Crunchy
Naturally sweet

It’s about that time of year for soup and lots of it. I’ve had a variation of this recipe in mind for quite some time now (it actually came to me while I was lying in savasana in yoga class – go figure), so I’m happy it now lives on the blog.
Friends, let’s make soup!

This soup comes together in 1 pot in 30 minutes! Easy peasy.
We start by sautéing garlic, shallot, ginger, and serrano pepper until tender. Then add carrots, which are the primary vegetable in this soup. However, you can also sub other seasonal vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, parsnips, or even pumpkin. Something hearty is preferred.

Next comes vegetable broth and a little coconut milk for flavor and creaminess, along with the lentils for plenty of plant-based protein and fiber. I love the flavor of our DIY Curry Powder, but you can use store-bought (or a similar blend of spices) as well. Coconut aminos adds a little more body and depth.
Once the lentils are tender, it’s time to dig in!


We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s:
Creamy
Nourishing
Satisfying
Subtly spiced
Versatile
Comforting
&amp; Extremely delicious
This would make the perfect dish when you need something nourishing and delicious on the table fast. It’s tasty on its own, but it would also pair well with things like our Curried Quinoa Chickpea Burgers, Spicy Mango Chutney, and Savory Abundance Kale Salad!

","Heat a large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add water (or oil) and shallot. Sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly browned.Add garlic, ginger, and serrano pepper and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Then add carrots and a pinch of salt and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Add vegetable broth and coconut milk and increase heat to medium high. Bring to a low boil. Then add lentils and stir. Once the mixture comes back to a low bubble, reduce heat to low or until you achieve a gentle simmer.Add coconut aminos and curry powder and stir once more. Simmer the soup uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 12-16 minutes or until the carrots and lentils are tender (red lentils cook pretty quickly, so if you're using other lentils, adjust cook time as needed). If the mixture becomes too thick, you can add more coconut milk or vegetable broth as needed. (We added a bit more of each to thin.)Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or coconut aminos for saltiness / depth of flavor or more curry powder for intense curry flavor.Divide between serving bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro and lemon juice or a little fresh coconut milk or cream (optional). Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop until hot, adding more vegetable broth to thin as needed. "
41,Smoky Grilled Eggplant | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky Grilled Eggplant


I have a thing for eggplant.
Baba ganoush is quickly becoming my favorite dip, eggplant dishes are the first thing I order at Mediterranean restaurants, and Eggplant Parmesan is basically my love language.
Yet I have neglected to share a recipe for eggplant in its simplest form: grilled – which is, perhaps, the quickest and most flavorful ways to prepare it. Shall we?

This recipe requires just 9 ingredients and 20 minutes to prepare. The first step it to cover the eggplant in some coconut aminos (or tamari) and a little oil to infuse flavor and prevent sticking when grilled.
Then comes the spice blend! I favor smoky flavors like cumin, paprika, and cayenne for eggplant. Coriander adds a little herbal quality, while salt and garlic powder add a kick of flavor.
Once it’s well seasoned, all that’s left to do is grill. I prefer a grill pan for ease, but an actual grill is the real deal and provides better flavor. I like placing something heavy on top of the eggplant while grilling – like a cast-iron skillet – to press the eggplant into the grill to get more pronounced grill marks.


We hope you LOVE this eggplant! It’s:
Flavorful
Smoky
Quick + Easy to make
Versatile
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect appetizer or side to practically anything Mediterranean-inspired. We love adding it to dishes like our Traditional Vegan Falafel, Greek Goddess Bowl, Ultimate Mediterranean Bowl, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, and Chickpea Shawarma Wrap.

","Slice the eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle the coconut aminos and half the oil over eggplant and use a brush or your hands to massage into the eggplant. The oil helps prevent sticking while grilling, and the coconut aminos infuses flavor.Add all the spices to a small dish and mix to combine. Then sprinkle over both sides of the eggplant and use your fingers to spread it around so it's well coated.Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, brush the grill surface with a little oil to further prevent sticking. Then add eggplant. It can be helpful to place something heavy on top of the eggplant while it's grilling (like a cast-iron pan or heavy plate) to impress the eggplant into the grooves of the grill to make more pronounced grill marks. Grill on both sides for about 3 minutes or until the eggplant becomes a little tender and grill marks are pronounced.Plate the eggplant and enjoy as is or garnish with tahini, garlic dill sauce, fresh herbs, or a little olive oil. This is delicious on its own, but I especially enjoy it with hummus, in a Mediterranean-themed bowl, or in a salad.Best when fresh, though leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in a cast-iron pan over medium heat until hot."
42,Fudgy Vegan Chocolate Cake Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Fudgy Chocolate Cake Bites


Have you ever wanted chocolate cake but didn’t want to bake a cake? (Yes, I just asked that question.)
Or have you ever craved chocolate cake but didn’t want the processed-sugar overload of the real deal?
I have just the thing! Behold the fudgy NO-BAKE Chocolate Cake BITE that’s naturally sweetened and easy to make! Let’s (not) bake!

These cake balls require just 7 ingredients (not including the glaze) and 30 minutes to make! Plus, they’re made with simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
The base starts with dates that are blended into a ball. Then dry ingredients like coconut flour, almond flour, and cacao powder are mixed to create a fluffy, chocolate cake-like texture and flavor. Then the two are mixed together.
The final additions? Vanilla extract for that real cake-like flavor, maple syrup for even more (natural) sweetness, and coconut cream for a little fudginess. Swoon!


Once your “cake batter” is formed into a loose dough, scoop into cake bites and chill. At this point, you can enjoy!
Or, if you want to go the extra mile, I’ve included not one but TWO glaze options below! The first uses coconut butter for more of a chunky glaze (pictured below), and the second is silky and smooth like ganache. You can’t lose either way!

We hope you LOVE these cake bites. They’re:
Fudgy
Chocolaty
Cakey
Rich
Easy to make
Super satisfying
&amp; Mega delicious
These would make the perfect healthier treat to have on hand throughout the week when dessert cravings strike! They’re also wholesome and hearty enough to pass as a snack (in our opinion), which makes them great for on-the-go energy bites.
If you’re into cake bites, also be sure to check out our Vanilla Cake Bites! And also our PB&amp;J Energy Bites, Dark Chocolate Hemp Energy Bites, and PB Cup Energy Bites.

","Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. To a food processor, add pitted dates and blend until small bits remain or a ball forms. Scoop out and set aside.To the food processor, add your almond flour, coconut flour, and cacao powder. Blend until a fine meal is achieved - about 20-30 seconds.Add the dates back in along with the vanilla extract, maple syrup, and coconut cream. Blend until a tacky dough forms. If it’s too dry, add a little more maple syrup. If it gets too wet or sticky, add more coconut flour as needed.Scoop out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts of dough (I like this scoop) and roll into balls. Repeat until all of your mixture is used up. Arrange on your parchment-lined baking sheet. Transfer to the freezer and freeze for 10 minutes.In the meantime, prepare glaze by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl and stirring thoroughly to combine. This is meant to be a semi-thick glaze with some texture. For a smoother, more ganache-like glaze, see notes.Remove cake bites from the freezer, and one at a time, dip cake bites into the glaze. Lift up with a fork or slotted spoon and tap off any excess glaze. Place back on the parchment paper to dry. Repeat until all cake bites are glazed. Then carefully transfer back to the freezer to set - about 10 minutes.Enjoy! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator or freezer (up to 1 month). Serve slightly chilled or at room temperature (but if too warm, the glaze can get soft)."
43,Gochujang Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gochujang Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts


We tried a new-to-us restaurant recently in Portland and it was so tasty that I knew right away I had to try to recreate their Gochujang Brussels sprouts at home!
Lucky for you, I’ve taken all the guess work out of this delicious side dish or appetizer. Plus, just 7 ingredients and 30 minutes required!

If you’re into Brussels sprouts, you’ll love this dish because they’re stir-fried to golden brown (but still tender) perfection and coated in the most savory, bangin’ sauce on the block: Korean Gochujang Chili Sauce!
Have you tried it yet? Most store-bought brands contain gluten and processed ingredients, so I set out to make my own. I’m so glad I did because I’ve been putting it on everything since, like Cauliflower Wings, my saucyCrispy Tofu, and now Brussels sprouts!

It all starts with the sauce, which comes together in 5 minutes. Then just heat a skillet over medium-high heat, add a little sesame oil, and start stir-frying these gems.The sauce coats the Brussels near the end of cooking and adds a nice caramelized effect. Swoon!


We hope you LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Saucy
Spicy
Quick + Easy
Satisfying
SUPER flavorful
&amp; Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect side or appetizer to things like our Eggplant Almond Butter Tofu Bowls, Spicy Gochujang Cauliflower Wings, Quinoa Fried Rice, Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry, and our 30-Minute Noodle-Free Pad Thai.

","Prepare sauce by adding Gochujang sauce, sesame oil (or water), coconut aminos, maple syrup, sea salt, and chili garlic sauce to a small mixing bowl and mix to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or coconut aminos for depth of flavor / saltiness. Set aside.Make sure your Brussels sprouts are rinsed, dried, and halved and any large stem portions are removed.Heat a large cast-iron or metal skillet over medium-high heat. Depending on the size of your skillet (ours was a 12-inch cast iron), you may need to cook the Brussels in two batches so they get evenly cooked and don’t crowd the pan.Once hot, add sesame or avocado oil (or water) to the pan and Brussels sprouts (know that oil is better for frying and caramelizing the sprouts). Season with the coconut aminos and toss to combine. Then evenly spread the Brussels sprouts in the pan so each one is touching the surface of the pan (remove any that are crowded).Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Then remove  lid and stir-fry uncovered for 2 minutes more, stirring occasionally to brown all sides. Turn down heat if needed if any are appearing too brown.Once the Brussels sprouts appear to be caramelized, add the sliced shallot or green onion (optional) and the prepared sauce and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes more to coat and caramelize the sprouts even more. Then turn off heat and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with crushed peanuts if desired (optional). Enjoy hot.Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Reheat over medium heat in a cast-iron skillet until hot. Not especially freezer friendly. These are delicious on their own but would also pair well with our Gochujang Cauliflower, Easy Vegan Kimchi, Quinoa Fried Rice, Sesame Eggplant and Almond Butter Tofu Bowls."
44,1-Bowl Vegan Banana Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Banana Oat Pancakes


Friends, behold perhaps my favorite pancakes of all time.
I mean, that’s a big statement, but it’s true. And can I also say that it was a long road to get here? What started as “blender oat pancakes” gone wrong morphed into this supreme stack of golden goodness – the victory was well earned. Let’s make pancakes!

These 1-bowl, 25-minute pancakes require 9 simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Mash a banana, add the wet ingredients, stir in the dry ingredients, and bam: You’ve got a bangin’ pancake batter on your hands.

We prefer cooking the pancakes on a seasoned cast-iron pan very lightly coated with oil (see cast-iron tips in our Instagram Story Highlights!). Brown on both sides and then keep warm in the oven until serving.
If you want to be extra (like me), you can sprinkle some chocolate chips and/or blueberries or huckleberries into the batter for next-level pancakes!


We hope you LOVE these pancakes as much as we do! They’re:
Fluffy
Tender
Naturally sweet
Banana-infused
Easy to make
&amp; Kind of perfect
These make the perfect special weekday breakfast or lazy weekend treat. I like making a batch, enjoying a few right away, and then freezing the rest to enjoy throughout the week! Although optional, we highly recommend adding a little fruit or vegan dark chocolate chips to the batter – they complement the banana flavor perfectly! Top with peanut butter and maple syrup for the ultimate breakfast.

","To a mixing bowl, add banana and mash. Then add oil, maple syrup, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine. Then add non-dairy milk (start with the lesser amount and work your way up as needed) and whisk to combine. If using coconut oil and it hardens or clumps, it's not a big deal. You can microwave (for 45 seconds - 1 minute) to remelt - otherwise, proceed.Add oat flour, gluten-free flour, and almond flour. Gently stir (being careful not to over-mix) to combine.  It should be thick but pourable/scoopable. If too thin, add more gluten-free or almond flour. If too thick, thin with a little non-dairy milk. If adding fruit or chocolate chips, add now and gently fold to combine. Heat a large nonstick skillet, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Carefully rub skillet with a little oil. (You will likely need to decrease the heat of the skillet to medium-low / low once it's hot as to not burn the pancakes.)Once hot, spoon 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the batter onto skillet. Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and the edges appear dry (~2-3 minutes). Carefully flip pancakes and cook until browned on the underside (~3 minutes more). The gluten-free flour blend benefits from a slightly longer cooking time, so don’t be shy to get a nice golden brown color on both sides.Transfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet or plate (don’t stack pancakes on top of one another) and keep warm in a 200-degree F (94 C) oven. Continue cooking until all batter is used up - about 12 pancakes (as original recipe is written).These pancakes are delicious on their own, but they're amplified with toppings such as additional fruit or chocolate chips, peanut butter, and maple syrup. Store cooled leftover pancakes (without toppings) in a container separated with wax or parchment paper to prevent sticking. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 4 days or in the freezer* up to 1 month. Reheat in the toaster oven, microwave, or oven until hot."
45,No-Bake Vegan Lemon Poppy Seed Donut Holes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Lemon Poppy Seed Donut Holes


Ready for something sweet (but secretly healthy)? I have just the thing.
No-bake vegan donut holes! Yes, it’s a thing. Let’s do this!

This 30-minute, 10-ingredient recipe starts with dates and nuts (walnuts or cashews or both), which creates a sweet, slightly nutty base.
Next come coconut and almond flour for a fluffy, cake-like feel. This is what makes them more the texture of cake or donuts than an energy bite.

The flavor comes from lemon juice and lemon zest, and the crunch comes from the addition of poppy seeds or chia seeds. Then just roll them into balls, freeze, and prepare your glaze.


For the glaze, I played around with a coconut butter option, but when you add liquids to coconut butter (e.g. lemon juice and maple syrup), it tends to seize up. So I went for a coconut oil-maple syrup glaze instead. However, I do include an oil-free glaze option in the notes!

We hope you LOVE these no-bake “donut holes.” They’re:
Naturally sweet
Tender
Lemon-infused
Portable
Satisfying
&amp; So delicious
These donut holes would make the perfect healthier snack or dessert. The lemon juice and zest punch through with a tart kick, which perfectly balances the sweetness of the dates. Plus, that glaze? Total swoon.

Then carefully transfer back to the freezer to set.Freeze for 10 minutes. Then remove from freezer and dip again.

Enjoy! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator (up to 1 week) or the freezer (up to 1 month). They can be stored at room temperature, but if too warm, the glaze can melt."

Who likes eggplant? (Unite!)
Who likes pizza? (OK, seriously, who isn’t raising their hand?)
Who’s stoked about combining the two? Me!
Let’s do this!

This 10-ingredient dinner or side is adapted and inspired by my Crispy Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan, only I took it a step further by adding pizza sauce and vegan cheese!
The base starts with thinly sliced eggplant (the thinner the better), which is then dipped in gluten-free flour, almond milk, and finally a crispy breading comprised of cornmeal, vegan parmesan cheese, and gluten-free bread crumbs.
Once they’re breaded, simply sauté on both sides until golden brown and then bake in the oven until crispy. All that’s left to do is top with a little red sauce and vegan cheese of choice and bake again until hot. And voila! Eggplant pizza.


We hope you LOVE these mini pizzas! They’re:
Crispy
Cheesy
Saucy
Versatile
Flavorful
&amp; Uber delicious
These pizzas would make the perfect side on Italian night or main when paired with hearty greens or our Best Vegan Meatballs! We especially love how crispy they are and that each bite includes plenty of hearty red sauce and vegan cheese!

For those looking to skip the breading process or make eggplant pizza on the grill (see below), we’ve got you covered! See alternative options in the notes!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Also, prepare your dipping stations by mixing together almond milk and cornstarch in one bowl; gluten-free flour, cornstarch, and sea salt in another bowl; and gluten-free panko bread crumbs, cornmeal, vegan parmesan cheese, and sea salt in another bowl (see photo).Next, dip eggplant slices in flour mixture, then almond milk mixture, and then breadcrumb mixture and arrange dipped rounds on a clean plate or baking sheet.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil (30 ml // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Let the oil heat for 1 minute. Then add 4-5 eggplant rounds at a time and brown for ~2-3 minutes on each side or until light golden brown. Then add to the prepared baking sheet and add baking sheet to the oven so the eggplant can start baking.Continue browning eggplant in batches until all rounds are browned and in the oven, adding more oil to the cooking pan as needed. Turn heat down if eggplant rounds are browning too quickly.Bake eggplant for 15-20 minutes or until crispy and golden brown, flipping once around the halfway mark to ensure even baking. Prepare sauce, vegan cheese, and any other toppings at this time (optional). Set aside.Remove eggplant from the oven when crispy and golden brown. Top with a little red sauce, vegan cheese of choice, and any other toppings, such as mixed vegetables. Bake for another 5-7 minutes or until cheese is lightly golden brown. Enjoy as is or garnish with red pepper flake, fresh basil, or vegan parmesan cheese.Best when fresh. But you can store completely cooled eggplant (that hasn’t had any sauce or toppings added) covered in the refrigerator up to 2 days. Reheat on a baking sheet in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until hot. You can also freeze UNCOOKED coated eggplant slices in a single layer and store in a freezer-safe container up to 1 month. From frozen, sauté on both sides until golden brown. Then bake in a 375-degree F (190 C) oven until hot, crispy, and golden brown. Top with desired toppings and then bake again to warm toppings - about 5 minutes."
47,Easy Vegan Gluten-Free Biscuits | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Gluten-Free Biscuits


After many requests, I present the Vegan Gluten-Free Biscuit! Many of you may know, but years ago I perfected theBest Damn Vegan Biscuitand damn, it’s good.
Since then, I developed a recipe forVegan Gluten-Free Shortcake, and in doing so I realized it wouldn’t be much more work to nail the biscuit version down. So that’s what I did. And this (new and improved) recipe is easy, requiring just8 simple ingredients, 30 minutes, and 1 bowl to make!

The base of this biscuit is a blend of potato starch,almond flour, and cornstarch, which provides a neutral flavor and light, fluffy texture (which is key in biscuits!). Salt adds flavor, baking powder helps them rise, and nutritional yeast (optional) adds a little more flavor.
Next comes vegan butter, the fat necessary to create a “flaky” biscuit. Don’t skimp on the fat, folks!




Last but not least is light coconut milk, which provides enough moisture to make a dough. Canned coconut milk is best here! Trust us. We tested others and they didn’t make as delicious of biscuits. Once you achieve a tacky dough, you’re ready to shape and cut out your biscuits!
Just a short bake in the oven at a high temp and voila! You have fluffy, tender, gluten-free, vegan biscuits on your hands! Yes, it’s that simple.


I hope you all LOVE these biscuits. They’re:
Fluffy
Tender
Buttery
Salty
Flaky
Satisfying
&amp; Delicious
These vegan, gluten-free biscuits are delicious with vegan butter and jam,compote, or even maple syrup. For a savory version, try topping them withMacadamia Nut Cheeseand roasted or fresh vegetables. Plus, they make the perfect companion to things likeVeggie Chili,Tomato Soup, andGravy!

*UPDATE: Recipe was updated and republished on 9/6/18 with new photos and adjustments for improved texture and flavor.
","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and set out a baking sheet. To a large mixing bowl, add potato starch (not flour), almond flour, cornstarch, sea salt, baking powder, cane sugar, and nutritional yeast (optional) and whisk to combine.Add vegan butter and use a pastry cutter, whisk, or fork to ""cut"" the oil into the flour until small bits remain (see photo). (We tried using coconut oil and while it did work, vegan butter yields a much fluffier, more tender, flavorful biscuit).Add the light coconut milk to the dry mixture and gently stir with a spoon to combine. You're looking for a semi-sticky dough and you may not use all of the coconut milk. If it looks too wet, compensate with 1-2 Tbsp at a time of almond flour or potato starch. Add more coconut milk if it is too crumbly. Transfer your dough onto a well (gluten-free) floured surface and dust the top with a little potato starch or almond flour. Handling as little as possible, form into a 1-inch-thick disc with your hands (these biscuits don’t puff up as much as their gluten-containing cousins, so only push the dough down as much as you desire them to be thick).Then, using a well-floured biscuit cutter, small cookie cutter, or narrow drinking glass, cut out biscuits and transfer carefully to a baking sheet with a spatula. Arrange the biscuits so they are close but not touching - see photo).Continue, reforming dough as needed, until all of the dough is used (as the recipe is written, about 12-14 small biscuits or 6-8 medium biscuits). Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted vegan butter (optional).Bake for 14-18 minutes or until they look dry and fluffy. Watch carefully and be sure not to burn. Remove biscuits from oven and let rest on pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer to a serving plate. Warm or room temperature is best for serving.Best when fresh. Store leftover biscuits covered at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 F) oven. These would go well with vegan gravy, and are especially delicious with a little vegan butter and jam or compote!"
48,Curried Socca Chickpea Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Curried Socca (Chickpea Bread)


Have you ever tried socca? It’s a new-to-us bread that’s not only vegan and gluten-free, but also grain-free, as it’s made with chickpea flour! And in this Indian-inspired version, we used whole spices to infuse a curry flavor into the bread. Swoon.
How do you enjoy socca? So many ways! This recipe in particular works well anywhere traditional naan would, as well as with dips such as hummus and baba ganoush. But you can also use it as a pizza base (just adjust the spices as desired)! We haven’t tried socca as pizza crust yet but suspect that it would make a delightful breadstick (recipe likely coming soon).
In the meantime, let us show you how easy it is to make this fluffy, flavorful bread!

This 7-ingredient recipe starts with garbanzo bean flour, salt, baking powder for a little rise, and warm water. This creates the base we add the delicious spices to.
For spices, we were inspired by Amy Chaplin’s recipe in At Home in the Whole Foods Kitchen(one of our absolute favorite cookbooks). Whole cumin, coriander, and mustard seed blend well with our homemade curry powder for the ultimate dreamy curry flavor.

Once the batter has rested for 30 minutes – 1 hour, it’s time to cook.
Socca is usually poured into a hot skillet to get brown on the edges and the underside. Then it’s transferred to the oven to get fluffy and cooked through. The whole process takes about 15 minutes. Easy peasy. Repeat until all of your batter is used up and you have mounds of fluffy socca on your hands.



We hope you LOVE this socca. It’s:
Fluffy
Savory
Smoky + Spicy
Crunchy from the whole seeds
Comforting
Nourishing
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect snack on its own or bread in place of naan or pita when you need a grain- or gluten-free option. Pair with dips like our Golden Goddess Hummusor saucy entrées like Kitchari. As we mentioned above, socca can also be made into pizza – a concept that’s on our testing list! Stay tuned.

","To a medium mixing bowl, add garbanzo bean flour, sea salt, and baking powder and whisk to combine. Slowly pour warm water into dry ingredients and whisk until smooth.Heat an oven-safe cast-iron or metal skillet (we prefer cast-iron) over low-medium heat. Add avocado oil, curry powder, cumin seed, coriander seed, and mustard seed (optional) and allow to toast until just fragrant (~2-3 minutes), stirring occasionally. Add spice mixture to chickpea batter, stir to combine, and then cover with plastic wrap or a towel and allow to rest on the counter for 1 hour (or at least 30 minutes). Once the socca has rested, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Also heat the oven-safe cast-iron or metal skillet from earlier over medium-high heat (it should still have a little oil from cooking the spices earlier, which is great for preventing sticking). Once hot, add enough chickpea batter that, when you swirl it around the pan, the batter spreads into a large, thin pancake that reaches the edges of the pan. Carefully transfer the hot skillet to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until bubbles have formed, the edges have browned, and the top is slightly golden brown.Remove from oven after baking and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then gently loosen with a spatula and slice on a cutting board (or slice right in the pan). Repeat cooking process with the remaining batter (our cast-iron skillet is 10 inches in size and yields two large pieces of socca as the recipe is written).Serve as is or with anything you'd enjoy with naan. Or eat this with dips such as hummus or baba ganoush. Best served fresh. Leftovers will keep at room temperature for 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Friends, behold one of the best things that’s ever come out of my kitchen: a savory, saucy, Black Bean Plantain Enchilada Bake! Just 10 ingredients required for this incredibly flavorful, hearty, comforting dish. Let’s do this!

This isn’t your average enchilada bake, as it relies onroasted slices of plantains in place of tortillas, which not only add a naturally sweet balance but also keep this recipe both gluten- and grain-free!
Just check out those plantains roasted until golden brown and slightly caramelized – swoon!

The next layer is black beans simply spiced with cumin and sea salt. We went with canned to save time, but you could also make our 1-Pot Black Beans from Scratch if you’d rather!

All that’s left is sauce, and we went with two: a combination of our Easy Red Enchilada Sauce and this Creamy Cashew Queso.
The two together make this dish saucy, cheesy, smoky, and utterly delicious. Now, let’s layer.

Layering is my favorite part because it’s so darn fun. Start with sauce, then plantains, then beans, cheese sauce, and so on and so forth until you have a multilayer, flavor-packed masterpiece that’s ready for the oven. Just a quick bake and it’s ready for your dinner table!


We hope you LOVE this enchilada bake! It’s:
Hearty
Smoky
Savory-sweet
Cheesy
Fiber-packed
Versatile
&amp; So delicious
This would make such a delicious meal for both weeknight dinners and hosting friends. It can also be prepped ahead of time, refrigerated, and baked later on to save time!
While delicious on its own, this bake would also pair well with Garlicky Guacamole + Baked Plantain Chips, Easy Red Salsa and chips, Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups with Avocado Dressing, 7-Layer Vegan Mexican Dip, and Ginger Beer Margaritas!

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line two baking sheets (or more as needed) with parchment paper.Carefully peel plantains, and one at a time, lay on a flat surface and thinly slice lengthwise - each plantain should yield about 5 thin slices. Arrange on your baking sheets in an even layer.Brush plantains with melted coconut oil (or spray with coconut oil) on both sides. Bake for about 20-30 minutes or until golden brown on both sides, being sure to rotate the pans and use a spatula to carefully flip the plantains near the halfway point to ensure even baking. You’re looking for tender, golden-brown plantains with a caramelized taste. Set aside and lower oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).In the meantime, add drained black beans to a large saucepan and add cumin. Heat over medium heat until bubbling, stirring frequently - about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and stir. Then turn off heat and set aside.To make the spreadable cheese, add raw cashews to a food processor and process into a butter, scraping down sides as needed. Add spices and chipotle pepper and mix until a thick spread is formed. Then add warm water a little at a time and blend until a creamy spreadable “queso” sauce is formed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chipotle pepper for heat, cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor. Set aside.To assemble your enchilada bake, spread a thin layer of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch (or comparable size) baking dish. (If multiplying this recipe, use more baking dishes as needed.) Then add a layer of plantains. Next, add a thin layer of cheese sauce. Then add half the beans. Next, add a generous layer of enchilada sauce followed by another layer of plantains. Next, add another thin layer of cheese sauce and top with the rest of the beans. Add another layer of enchilada sauce, reserving a small amount for the top player. Then add your last layer of plantains and brush with/spread any remaining enchilada sauce. Top with any remaining cheese sauce - we scooped ours into a plastic bag, cut the corner off, and piped it on for easy application. But you can also just spread it on with a spoon.Cover with foil and bake 30-35 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C) or until hot and bubbly on the edges. Remove from oven and let cool briefly before slicing and serving. Enjoy as is or with sliced jalapeños, onion, or fresh cilantro. Guacamole would also be a great addition!Freeze leftovers up to 1 month or store covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until hot."
50,Cheesy Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cheesy Vegan Spinach &amp; Artichoke Dip


It’s here! Our go-to recipe for easy, vegan spinach and artichoke dip! Let’s do this!

This 10-ingredient recipe comes together quickly and easily with foolproof methods.
Inspired by our White Bean &amp; Kale Artichoke Dip, we simplified things even more and removed vegan cream cheese as an ingredient, as it can be difficult to find for some and often contains processed soy (an ingredient many try to avoid).
The base is instead made of a simple puréed cashew cream seasoned with nutritional yeast, sautéed shallot and garlic, salt, and pepper.
We went for fresh spinach, but you can always use frozen if that’s what you have on hand (just be sure to thaw and squeeze out excess liquid before use). And once the spinach and artichokes are combined with the sauce, simply bake for a few minutes until bubbly and hot. Then serve. Swoon!


We hope you LOVE this dip! It’s:
Creamy
Cheesy
Vegetable-Packed
Savory
Comforting
Versatile
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect dip to go alongside fresh vegetables, pita chips, baguette, or flatbread! Our favorite is tortilla chips – something about the crunchy/salty factor just works.

","Soak cashews for 1 hour in very hot water (uncovered) or in cool water overnight. Then drain and set aside.In the meantime, heat a large oven-safe metal or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, garlic, and shallot. Sauté for 1-2 minutes. Then lower heat to medium/low and sauté for 2-3 minutes more or until just golden brown and slightly caramelized. Set off the heat to cool.Once cashews are soaked and drained, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). To a blender, add soaked and drained cashews, half of the sautéed garlic and shallot, almond milk, nutritional yeast, sea salt, and pepper and blend into a creamy purée, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Dip should be cheesy in flavor and well salted, so consider adding more nutritional yeast for cheesiness or another pinch sea salt for saltiness. Set aside.Heat the skillet with the remaining shallot and garlic over medium-high heat and add spinach and chopped artichokes. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, to wilt and soften spinach.Turn heat off and add all of the sauce. Stir to combine. Sprinkle the top with vegan parmesan cheese, bread crumbs (optional), and red pepper flake (optional). Bake for about 5-8 minutes or until the dip is hot enough to serve. Be careful not to over-bake or the cheese sauce can begin to dry out and lose its creamy texture. Serve hot with assorted vegetables, tortilla chips, crackers, or toasted baguette - tortilla chips being our favorite. Store leftover dip covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in an oven-safe dish at 350 degrees F (176 C) until warmed through (or in the microwave), adding more almond milk as needed if dip has dried out."

Once your other recipes are prepared, this meal is quick to assemble, incredibly flavor, fiber- and protein-rich, and just all-around delicious. Shall we?

When it comes to BBQ, I’m all about the sides (and the sauce). So when I realized I have recipes for my three favorite sides – beans, coleslaw, and corn – I knew that it was time to throw it all together and call it a meal.
For the corn, I included options for both grilled corn and cornbread (both gluten-free and non-GF options), depending on your taste. Either way, you can’t go wrong!

53,How to Roast Vegetables | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Roast Vegetables (Plus 6 Ways to Enjoy Them!)

Hello friends! Consider this your step-by-step tutorial on how to roast vegetables (with and without oil)!
We believe roasting vegetables is a basic cooking skill that everyone should know. Not only is it useful year-round, but it’s also a quick and way to feed yourself a variety of ways.

In addition to the roasting method, we also included 6 delicious and easy ways to put them to use so you can feed yourself and those you love!
Check out the video below to see what we mean, or skip down to the recipe to learn all about the roasting process!


","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and prepare 1-2 large baking sheets (depending on how many vegetables you're roasting) with parchment paper or a non-stick sheet.Follow the tips above to prepare vegetables for roasting by rinsing as needed, peeling as desired, and slicing/piecing into bite-size pieces. Peeling the garlic is optional - it can be roasted peeled OR with the skin on.Add vegetables to the same baking pans according to their required cook time. Root vegetables (beets, carrots, potatoes, etc.) generally tend to take longer (up to 40 minutes), so I like to group them together so they finish baking at the same time.Cruciferous vegetables (like cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage), as well as garlic and onion don't tend to require as time to cook (~25 minutes) so we recommend grouping them together on a separate pan so they finish baking at the same time.Once on the pan, drizzle with a little oil to coat (see this method for oil-free!), a pinch of salt, and desired seasonings of choice. We prefer a heavy coating of curry powder. NOTE: However, depending on how you intend to use the vegetables, you may choose not to season. For instance, if you plan to freeze your roasted carrots or sweet potatoes and then add them to smoothies, maybe just add a little salt and omit any further seasoning.Rub the oil and seasonings of choice into the vegetables and arrange into even layers so there isn't much or any overlap. Then bake until golden brown and tender (anywhere from 20-30 for cruciferous vegetables, onions, and garlic, and anywhere from 25-40 for root vegetables).Remove from oven and enjoy immediately on things like salads, bowls, in pasta salads and more! See the video below for inspiration. I like to freeze my roasted (or even steamed) carrots and sweet potatoes to add to smoothies throughout the week. My favorite way to use beets is blended into hummus. And roasted broccoli and cauliflower are perfect for grain bowls, pasta salads, and more.Enjoy when fresh, or store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, or in a 375 degree F (190 C) oven until hot.You can also freeze up to 1 month, but it's usually best to add these frozen roasted vegetables to things like smoothies, stews, and vegetable broth where their texture will be masked."
54,1-Pot BBQ Baked Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot BBQ Baked Beans


When BBQ season comes around, my mind goes straight to the beans.
I’ve loved BBQ baked beans for as long as I can remember. They’re equal parts savory and sweet with a little spice. My version includes instructions for both dry pinto beans and canned, depending on how much time you’ve got on your hands. Let us show you how easy it is!

This 1-pot recipe starts with pinto beans that are soaked overnight (or at least 6 hours). They’re then simmered with a little vegetable broth and water. That’s where the fun begins.

Mustard is added for a little tanginess, tomato paste for a hearty tomato flavor, coconut sugar for natural sweetness, and chili powder for heat. Next come salt and pepper to taste and an optional dash of hot sauce for a little heat to balance the sweetness.
The real secret of these beans comes from a dash of liquid smoke, which adds a smokiness that traditionally comes from bacon. This meat-free version is just as rich and satisfying as the “real deal.”

﻿
We hope you LOVE these beans! They’re:
Hearty
Smoky
Salty-sweet
Subtly spiced
Easy to make
Super versatile
&amp; So delicious
These beans would make the perfect side to just about any grilled dish like our Grillable Veggie Burgers, BBQ Black Bean Burger, and Grilled Veggie Skewers. They would also pair especially well with our Garlicky Kale Salad and Simple French-Style Potato Salad!

","Add pinto beans to a large pot and cover with cool water (at least a few inches above the beans as they will expand). Soak for at least 6 hours or overnight* uncovered at room temperature. Once beans are soaked, drain and set aside.Heat your large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), diced onion, and bell pepper. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is soft and translucent.Next, add drained beans and vegetable broth and cover with water about 1 inch over the top, as the beans will expand while cooking. Bring to a low boil. Then reduce heat to low or medium-low so it simmers but doesn’t boil. Cook uncovered for 1 hour or until beans are tender.Once the beans are tender and cooked through, add remaining seasonings: Mustard, tomato paste, coconut sugar, salt, pepper, chili powder, liquid smoke, and hot sauce (optional). Stir to coat and cook on low for 10-15 more minutes to let the flavors meld.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt to taste, chili powder or hot sauce for heat, coconut sugar for sweetness, mustard for tanginess, or tomato paste for depth of flavor.

Will keep in the freezer for 1 month (oftentimes longer)."
55,Simple French-Style Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple French-Style Potato Salad


This simple potato salad is inspired by one we tried while in Austin. The potato salads I’m used to having are typically dressed with a mayo sauce, making them thicker and more indulgent. But I loved the tangy, light quality of a potato salad dressed in an herb-infused vinaigrette instead.
I later discovered that this is more of a French style of preparing potato salad. I hope you enjoy this inspired version that’s perfect for summer BBQs, lazy picnics, road trips, and more.

This 10-ingredient, 30-minute recipe starts with thinly sliced baby potatoes (we enjoyed a mix of gold and red) boiled until just tender. They’re then seasoned with salt, pepper, and a dash of apple cider vinegar for a layer of flavor.

The dressing is a simple garlicky mustard vinaigrette with both red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar. We found that the combination of these two provide the perfect amount and quality of acidity. Fresh herbs add even more earthy flavor, while olive oil helps create a creamy texture. Swoon.


Once the dressing is prepared, all that’s left to do is add fresh chopped herbs and green onion to the boiled potatoes and combine.
This potato salad can be enjoyed warm, at room temperature, and even chilled – our favorite being room temperature.

We hope you love this elegant potato salad. It’s:
Light
Refreshing
Tangy
Buttery
Satisfying
Versatile
&amp; Utterly delicious
This would make the perfect side to go alongside grill-friendly dishes like Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burgers, Jerk-Style Grilled Eggplant, and Grilled Veggie Skewers. It would also pair well with our Vegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich, Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli, and Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas.

","Rinse and scrub potatoes, then slice into 1/4-inch slices. Add to a large saucepan and cover with water. Add a healthy dash of salt (for flavor) and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat slightly (to medium/high) and continue cooking for 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are easily pierced with a knife and also easily slide off the knife. Be sure not to undercook the potatoes or they can be waxy and difficult to eat. When in doubt, carefully scoop out a potato and test it to see if it’s the right doneness.Once the potatoes have finished cooking, drain and rinse with cool water. Then once mostly dry, add to a large serving bowl. Season with a dash of salt and black pepper and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.While potatoes are cooking, prepare dressing. Add mustard, garlic, salt, pepper, red wine vinegar, and apple cider vinegar to a mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then, while continuing to whisk, slowly stream in the olive oil to emulsify the oil and vinegar. Add the dill and whisk once more. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, black pepper for spice, mustard for intense mustard flavor, vinegar for more acidity, or dill for herbal flavor.Add the dressing to the potatoes along with the green onion and parsley (optional), and toss to combine. Taste the potato salad and adjust salt and pepper again (we added a bit more of each). It’s now ready to enjoy, but it also soaks in more of the flavor of the dressing the longer it sits.Serve warm, chilled, or room temperature. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days. Not freezer friendly."
56,4-Ingredient Golden Milk Mix | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Golden Milk Mix


When golden milk cravings strike, there’s hardly time to fuss with getting out all the spices, which is why I recently made my own “mix.”
Because I enjoy golden milk most afternoons, I’ve been using my mix almost daily! It’s the perfection solution to help speed the golden milk process along to save time and energy. Let me show you how.

This 4-ingredient, 5-minute mix is made of the 4 basic spices added to most golden milk: turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, and ginger.
The result is an earthy, spicy, comforting blend that pairs perfectly with dairy-free milk and a little sweetener.

In the winter, I’m all about the hot golden milk, but when summertime comes, I crave things that help me stay cool. In the instructions,you’ll see tips on how to make both hot and cold golden milk, depending on what climate (and mood) you’re experiencing.


We hope you LOVE this mix! It’s:
Easy to make
Super convenient to have on hand
Anti-inflammatory
Sugar-free
&amp; Super tasty
Lately, I’ve been preferring this quick mix over getting out all the spices and grating fresh ginger for my daily dose of golden milk. The simplicity of it – and the flavor! – has me hooked. We hope you love it, too. In addition to being used to make golden milk, we also think it makes a delicious spice mix for vegetables, soups, smoothies, and more!

57,Vegan Gluten-Free Trail Mix Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Trail Mix Cookies (Gluten-Free + Grain-Free)


Friends! They’re here! My new cookie crush.
Imagine this: aperfectly baked, tender cookie studded with dark chocolate (or dried fruit!) that’s naturally sweetened, vegan, gluten-free, and grain-free! Plus, it’s made with 10 wholesome ingredients you probably have on hand right now. Let’s bake!

The base of this cookie is inspired and adapted from my Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies. Aquafaba provides moisture and binding (acting as our egg substitute), almond flour and shredded coconut replace traditional flours, and coconut oil replaces butter.
To keep things naturally sweetened, we went with coconut sugar and a little maple syrup. To keep these entirely refined sugar-free, be sure to use a bittersweet dark chocolate chip (or unsweetened dried fruit!).


The star of the show is seeds! I used this lovely Superfood Burcha mix, which includes tasty things like pumpkin, flax, sesame, sunflower, and cacao nibs. But you can really use any combination of seeds you want!
The result is a cookie with lots of fiber, healthy fats, protein, and a subtle crunch.

We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Perfectly browned on the outside
Naturally sweet
Studded with dark chocolate
Easy to make
&amp; Healthier than your average cookie!
These would make the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand throughout the week. Store in a cookie jar (because fun)or in the freezer to keep them fresh even longer! I could see making these in larger batches and tucking them away in the freezer for future snack attacks. Also, these would make the ideal trail, camping, or road trip treat! So many options.

","In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, dark chocolate chips, seeds, coconut, baking powder, salt, and coconut sugar.In a separate bowl, beat aquafaba (using a handheld mixer or whisking vigorously) until light and fluffy and loose peaks have formed. (TIP: Add a little cream of tartar to help it along if not whipping.)To the aquafaba, add the melted coconut oil, vanilla (optional), and maple syrup and beat or whisk to combine (aquafaba will deflate a little - that’s normal). Then add to dry ingredients and mix until just combined. You should have a firm, semi-tacky dough (see photo). If too wet, add a bit more coconut or almond flour.Loosely cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Scoop out 3-Tablespoon amounts of dough (I used this scoop, scooped out two balls, and then formed them together) and form into balls. Then slightly press them down into discs (see photo). Top with a few more chocolate chips if desired.Place on a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap in between each cookie to allow for a little spreading. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the undersides are golden brown and the tops appear slightly puffy and cracked.Remove from oven and let cool on the pan for 10 minutes. Then carefully loosen with a spatula - they can stick a little to the bare pan.Enjoy immediately or let cool completely before storing leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature up to 4 days, 1 week in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer. "
58,Curry Spiced Quinoa Chickpea Burgers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curried Quinoa Chickpea Burgers


I’ve been so excited to share this recipe since perfecting the concept this summer. I’d been dreaming of a curry-infused chickpea burger for a while. And although ittook me several tries to nail, it was totally worth the effort! Friends, it’s burger time.

This 10-ingredient burger is made with cooked quinoa and baked chickpeas. The chickpeas provide plenty of plant-based protein and fiber, while the quinoa helps bind the burger and stay together for cooking.
Serrano pepper adds heat, ginger adds spice, and garlic infuses plenty of zingy garlic flavor. Lastly, my go-tocurry powder injects tons of gorgeous flavor in one fell swoop.
The last element is cooked potatoes that are mashed, seasoned, and stirred into the quinoa-chickpea mixture. This helps round out the flavor and texture super well and adds even more carby goodness to the mix (swoon).


All that’s left to do is cook! We opted for a quick sauté in a cast-iron before finishing in the oven to continue cooking the burgers through. These would also probably grill well (if done gently).

Might we suggest the perfect way to enjoy these gorgeous burgers? Serve atop lettuce or a green salad and plenty of our Spicy Mango Chutney! The pairing is out of this world! Take it a step further by adding our Green Curry Tahini dressing for even more big flavor.

We hope you LOVE these burgers! They’re:
Perfectly tender
Hearty
Super flavorful
Easy to make
Great for a crowd
Versatile
&amp; Super delicious
These burgers would make the perfect healthier meal when you’ve got a little more time on your hands and want to impress family or friends. They are ideal for making ahead of time (and in larger batches) for future meals. My preferred method is to make a double batch, enjoy half through the week for lunch or dinner, and freeze the other half for future busy days!

","If you haven’t prepared your quinoa yet, do so now (make sure it’s cooked and cooled completely before use).Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Add rinsed, dried chickpeas to a parchment-lined baking sheet and toss with oil, salt, and curry powder. Bake for 20 minutes or until chickpeas appear cracked and feel dry to the touch. Remove chickpeas from the oven and set aside. Keep oven on.In the meantime, add diced potatoes (smaller / bite size) to a rimmed, oven-safe medium skillet along with oil, salt, and curry powder. Cover and cook for 4 minutes. Then decrease heat to medium low, add water, and cover again. Continue cooking potatoes until browned on the edges and tender. Then turn off heat and use a fork or potato masher to mash them until nearly creamy (as few chunks as possible). Set aside.Add cooked chickpeas to a food processor along with cashews, serrano pepper (optional), ginger, garlic, salt, curry powder, harissa paste, and cilantro (optional) and blend into a semi-loose dough. Then add cooked/cooled quinoa and pulse to combine until a textured dough forms (you're not looking for a purée).Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl and add mashed potatoes. Stir to combine (it’s important not to add the potatoes to the food processor or they can become gummy when overmixed). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more curry powder for intense curry flavor, salt for saltiness, or harissa paste for more spice.Divide the mixture into roughly 2/3-cup portions and form into discs about 3/4-inch in height.*Heat the rimmed, oven-safe medium skillet (from earlier) over medium heat. Once hot, add a little oil and the burgers and cook for 2-3 minutes or until bottom side is golden brown. Flip and then transfer pan to the oven to bake for 12-15 minutes (baking in the oven is an optional step, but one that ensures the center is fully cooked).For serving, enjoy in a traditional bun, with naan, on a salad, or wrapped in a butter lettuce leaf. Add (optional) sliced red onions and mango chutney (total swoon).Store leftover patties covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. If you want to freeze them, either freeze once cooked and cooled OR before sauteing and baking. Add patties to a freezer-safe container and freeze up to 1 month.

This chutney starts by sautéing onion, serrano pepper, bell pepper, and ginger in a saucepan with simple spices. Then comes the mango, a little mango or orange juice, coconut sugar for natural sweetness, apple cider vinegar for acidity, and sea salt to taste.
The result is a tender, perfectly cooked mango chutney that’s equal parts sweet, spicy, and sour!


We hope you LOVE this chutney! It’s:
Hearty
Easy to make
FULL of flavor
Spicy-sweet
Versatile
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect sauce or dip for Indian-inspired dishes like Pakoras, Aloo Tiki, or our Shawarma Cauliflower Steaks! We’re working on plenty more recipes this chutney would pair perfectly with, so stay tuned!

","In a small saucepan over medium heat, add coconut oil (or water), red onion, serrano pepper, red bell pepper (optional), ginger, red pepper flakes, and curry powder. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the remaining ingredients and cover. Cook on low for 20-30 minutes. The mango should be soft but not entirely puréed/mushy.Enjoy warm or let cool to room temperature before use. Enjoy on salads, aloo tiki, and samosas or with bowls, naan, or pakoras! Will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month (let thaw before use)."
60,Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Freezer Fudge (4 Ingredients!)


Say hello to your new favorite (naturally sweetened, incredibly rich, salty-sweet) dessert.
Chocolate Peanut Butter Freezer Fudge made with just 4 ingredients, in 30 minutes, and 1 bowl (food processor)! Shall we?

This recipe was inspired by simplicity.
I’ve made fudgeI adore in the past, but some people tend to have trouble with their food processors being able to make coconut butter – a central ingredient in that recipe. So I wanted to come up with a variation that would be a little easier to tackle. And thus, freezer fudge was born!

This recipe is made entirely in the food processor. First, dates are processed until a paste or ball forms. Then peanut butter is blended in. Next comes cacao powder for that rich, chocolaty flavor. And lastly, coconut oil makes everything creamy and smooth.
Just look at that dreamy goodness. I could hardly keep my spoon out of the bowl!


Simply transfer to a parchment-lined dish, freeze, slice into squares, and you’re golden.
Share this fudge with everyone – friends, family, neighbors. They won’t believe that it’s made with simple ingredients and naturally sweetened! It’s kind of incredible!

We hope you LOVE this fudge! It’s:
Creamy
Rich
Chocolaty
Peanut buttery
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Perfectly delicious
Keep this fudge on hand for a healthier treat to indulge in throughout the week. Or make a batch to bring to dinners, gatherings, or parties. We can almost guarantee that it will be the most popular dessert on the table.

","To a food processor, add pitted dates and mix until a fine paste or a small ball forms.Remove lid and add peanut butter. Blend once more to combine.Add cacao powder and blend once more to combine.Add melted coconut oil, starting with the smaller measurement and working your way up as needed until a fudgy paste is formed. It's OK if it looks a little clumpy at this point (see photo). You mostly just want to make sure it's not dry, so add more oil as needed. (You shouldn't need more than the recommended amount of coconut oil.) If it's clumpy or a tad grainy, that's OK. You can smooth it out in the next step. Transfer to a parchment-lined loaf (or 8x8-inch) pan and spread with the back of a spoon until a smooth, even surface is achieved. Top with roasted salted peanuts and/or cacao nibs for texture (optional).Transfer to freezer and freeze until firm to the touch - about 20 minutes or more as needed. Then remove from freezer and slice into desired squares. If it has trouble slicing, let thaw for a few more minutes and/or run your knife under hot water to ease cutting.Enjoy! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week, or in the freezer up to 1 month. This fudge does best when kept refrigerated. If it sits out for too long in a warm environment, it can soften."
61,Cheesy Spaghetti Squash Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cheesy Spaghetti Squash Pasta


So you’ve probably had cheesy pasta. And you’ve had spaghetti squash pasta. But have you had Cheesy Spaghetti Squash Pasta?! If not, it’s time!

This 9-ingredient recipe starts with roasted spaghetti squash.
I typically cut my spaghetti squash in half and roast it using this method. But I wanted to try Beth’s method of slicing it in rings before baking to achieve longer noodles. I’m happy to report that both work well, so do whichever is easiest for you!

While your squash is roasting, soak cashews and then blend with nutritional yeast, lemon juice, garlic, and sea salt for a creamy vegan ricotta cheese sauce!
Once your squash is finished cooking, use a fork to separate the flesh into “noodles” and set aside. Then sauté onion and garlic until tender, add squash and cheese sauce, and cook until hot and cheesy! That’s it.


We hope you LOVE this pasta! It’s:
Cheesy
Flavorful
Tender
Satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect side dish for Italian night or entrée when topped with something like our Best Vegan Meatballs! Need something green on the side? Try out our Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas or Vegan Ricotta &amp; Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Salad.

","Begin by soaking cashews in very hot water for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour. Set aside.In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Slice spaghetti squash crosswise into 2-inch-wide rings (for longer noodles) OR slice in half lengthwise (for shorter noodles). Scoop out the seeds and strings and rub the flesh with oil (or water) and sea salt.Lay squash on a baking sheet - cut side down if cut in half lengthwise. Roast until tender - about 40 minutes if roasting “rings” and up to 45 minutes - 1 hour if roasting two large halves. (Time will vary depending on the size of your squash.) Let squash cool slightly and then use a fork to separate the “noodles."" Set aside.Once cashews are soaked, drain and add to a food processor or small blender. Add nutritional yeast, lemon juice, sea salt, garlic powder, and water and blend until smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed (~2 minutes). Aim for a mostly puréed mixture with only small bits of cashews intact. Add a bit more water a little at a time if the mixture is having a hard time blending until almost smooth.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for acidity. For even more flavor, you can add some fresh basil or parsley (optional).Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the oil (or water), shallot, garlic, and a pinch of salt and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Turn down heat if garlic is browning.Add spaghetti squash and toss gently to combine (with tongs if you have them). Sauté for 2-3 minutes, tossing occasionally.Add the desired amount of cheese sauce. We recommend starting with half and working your way up. You can serve the pasta with any leftover cheese sauce on the side. Continue cooking the cheesy pasta for 2-3 minutes more to combine the pasta and sauce, tossing carefully. Enjoy as is or top with vegan parmesan cheese, marinara sauce, or Vegan Meatballs! You can store leftover cheesy pasta in the refrigerator up to 4 days. We suspect that it would keep in the freezer up to 1 month but haven’t tried it ourselves. (Pasta is usually best fresh.) You can store any leftover cheese sauce covered (separately) in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days. "
62,The Best Vegan Meatballs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Meatballs


Friends, this feels big. Vegan meatballs made with real food that are full of flavor, don’t fall apart, aren’t mushy, and are easy to make! Let’s do this!

This 10-ingredient recipe starts with black beans that have been baked to dry them out – this is important, as it helps prevent the meatballs from becoming mushy.
The beans are then blended with herbs, spices, and sautéed garlic and shallot for layers of flavor.

Next comes the cooked and cooled quinoa, more herbs, tomato paste, and vegan Worcestershire (which is optional, but it adds more depth of flavor). Pulse a few more times and you’re ready to form your meatballs! After a quick chill in the refrigerator, it’s time to cook (and eat)!

To cook the meatballs, we went for a stovetop-oven combo. A quick sauté in the skillet you used to cook the onions and garlic in provides a crusty outer texture, while a bake in the oven dries them out a bit and ensures they’re cooked through the center.
At the end, for even more flavor, you can add your favorite marinara sauce and cook for another 5-10 minutes or until bubbly. Swoon. Then it’s meal time!


We hope you LOVE these meatballs! They’re:
Firm but tender
Not mushy
Packed with flavor
Made with wholesome ingredients
Protein- + Fiber-packed
&amp; Incredibly delicious
These meatballs are delicious on their own, but they would also pair well with just about any pasta, like our Simple Chickpea Bolognese or 30-Minute Cashew Alfredoor Chili Garlic Pasta with Roasted Cauliflower. I could also see them working well on things like pizza and even sub sandwiches! Melt a little Vegan Mozzarella on top and you’re in business!

","If you haven’t prepared your quinoa yet, do so now (make sure it’s cooked and cooled completely before use). *Prep/cook time does not include preparing quinoa.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add rinsed, dried black beans to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until beans appear cracked and feel dry to the touch (see beans in food processor photo). Remove beans from the oven and then increase oven heat to 375 degrees F (190C).Heat a large (oven-safe) skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add water (or oil), garlic, and shallot. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly softened, stirring frequently. Remove from heat (and reserve pan for later use).Add black beans to a food processor along with garlic, shallot, sea salt, oregano, red pepper flake, and fennel (optional) and pulse into a loose meal (DON'T overmix). Then add cooked/cooled quinoa, vegan parmesan cheese, tomato paste, fresh basil or parsley, and Worcestershire (optional). Pulse to combine until a textured dough forms (you're not looking for a purée, but it should be semi-tacky).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness/depth of flavor, red pepper flake for heat, herbs for earthiness, or Worcestershire (optional) for more depth of flavor. If it’s too tacky or wet, add more vegan parmesan cheese and pulse to combine (we added a bit more).Scoop out heaping 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts (using this scoop or a Tablespoon) and gently form into small balls using your hands. Add to a plate and refrigerate for 15 minutes.Heat an oven-safe metal or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the meatballs and sauté for a few minutes, gently turning the meatballs to get a slight crust on either side. Then transfer to the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown on the edges and slightly dry to the touch. These meatballs are delicious as is, or you can add some marinara to the pan and heat over medium heat for 5 minutes (or until bubbling / hot) to infuse more flavor.Serve with marinara and additional vegan parmesan cheese (optional)! These are also delicious atop any pasta. Leftover meatballs keep for 4-5 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. Reheat in the microwave or in a 375-degree F (190 C) oven until warmed through."

Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me…
I know I do this every year. I make something sweet like cakeor cheesecake and I sing myself happy birthday. But hey, can you blame me? Your own birthday is kinda the best, especially when it lands smack dab in the middle of summer.
To celebrate, let’s make pudding – Peanut Butter Banana Pudding to be exact!

This 5-ingredient banana pudding is a direct result of my smashing success in making Vegan Peanut Butter Pudding! I couldn’t help but take it and do something Banana Cream Pie-esque with it, and thus, banana pudding was born.
It all starts with peanut butter pudding whipped with coconut whipped creamto create a fluffy, perfectly sweet peanut butter base.

Next, you simply layer it with your Homemade Vegan Vanilla Wafers (or try our 3-Ingredient PB Cookies for a no-bake option!) and fresh sliced bananas. Top with a little more coconut whip, bananas, and crumbled wafers and you’re golden!


We hope you LOVE this pudding! It’s:
Creamy from the pudding
Fluffy from the coconut whip
Crunchy from the vanilla wafers
Salty-sweet
Perfect for celebrations
&amp; Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect warm-weather dessert because it’s cold, creamy, and outta-this-world tasty. It’s amazing as is, but I could also see a drizzle of 5-Ingredient Vegan Caramel Sauce being the perfect topper.

Set in refrigerator.In a large mixing bowl, use a rubber spatula to gently mix together pudding and half of the coconut whipped cream.In a 9x13 inch (or comparable size) pan, begin by adding a layer of vanilla wafers (reserving some wafers for the top layer). Using three of the bananas, add a layer of thinly sliced bananas on top of the vanilla wafers.For the next layer, top bananas with the pudding-coconut-whip mixture. Smooth the top with a wooden spoon. Use the same method to top with the remaining coconut whipped cream.Cover and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4-6 hours, preferably overnight.Remove from fridge and top with a layer of loosely arranged sliced bananas.

Pudding. How could pudding be so difficult to master? This recipe threw me for a loop. I tested it no less than 10 times! And it only became peanut butter pudding in the eleventh hour. And oh dear, I’m so glad it did. Talk about creamy, dreamy, pillowy deliciousness.
Friends, I can’t wait for you to try this amazing1-pot, 5-ingredient pudding! Let’s do it.

This recipe starts with coconut milk (full-fat is best!) and arrowroot starch to thicken. Once you cook that for about 5 minutes, it should be thick and pudding-like, as you’ll see below.

Next, it’s time to add flavor in the form of peanut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla! That’s right, maple syrup keeps this recipe naturally sweetened. Dreams do come true! I mean, just look at that creaminess!
P.S. – If you’re more into dates than maple syrup, I included a date-sweetened option in the notes.

Are you even ready for this pudding? I mean, are you? Look at those ribbons! Look at that color! Look at the thickness! It’s too much for my eyes to handle. I have to go make it again.


I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Creamy
Thick
Peanut buttery
Naturally sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This makes the perfect healthier treat when dessert cravings strike. It’s also tasty topped with coconut whipped cream and crushed peanuts! And don’t forget the 2-ingredient chocolate ganache (recipe below)! Pour a layer of that on top and you’ve got a peanut butter cup surprise.

Did you ever eat vanilla wafers as a kid? You know I did. They were a favorite in our house, especially for snacking, dipping in milk, and layering in things like banana cream pie and pudding. Mmm, pudding.
As you might’ve guessed, I’ve recreated this childhood classic with real, whole food ingredients so they’re now vegan and gluten-free! Let’s do this!

This 9-ingredient recipe starts with a mix of organic cane sugar (or coconut sugar), coconut oil, and a hefty pour of vanilla. I relied on aquafaba for an egg replacer that is colorless, helps bind, and also contributes to a little rise when baking.
For flours, I went with a mix of almond flour,guten-free flour blend, and cornstarch (or arrowroot starch). This keeps the cookies light and provides a slight crunch.

Once you roll out your dough, simply cut into tiny circles (35 to be exact) and bake until crisp and slightly golden brown.


We hope you LOVE these vanilla wafers! They’re:
Crisp
Perfectly sweet
Vanilla-infused
Easy to make

","Line a large baking sheet (or more as needed) with parchment paper. Set aside.In a medium mixing bowl, whisk or beat coconut oil until light and fluffy in texture, similar to how you could cream butter - about 30 seconds. Then add sugar and vanilla and whisk/beat for 1 minute more.Add chickpea brine and whisk vigorously or beat for 30 seconds. Then add almond milk and mix once more. It may look a little congealed, but that is okay. Keep going.Add salt, almond flour, and cornstarch and whisk/beat to combine. Lastly, add gluten-free flour blend and stir with a wooden spoon until a loose batter is formed. It should look like cookie batter but slightly softer. If too thin, add a mix of more almond flour and gluten-free blend until a dough consistency is reached. If too thick, add a splash of almond milk. Chill batter for 15 minutes (uncovered) while preheating oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Once chilled, roll out into a 1/4-inch-thick rectangle between two pieces of wax paper and use a small circle cookie cutter to cut out cookie shapes. Reform dough as needed until it's all used up.Gently transfer cookies to your parchment-lined baking sheet. They won’t spread while cooking, so they can go pretty close together. However, you may need to bake these in two batches depending on the size of your baking sheet.Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom and dry on the top. For crunchier cookies, bake longer. Just be careful not to burn. For more tender cookies, bake less.Let cool completely before removing from the pan.

70,How to Make Sauerkraut | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Sauerkraut


My first experience with sauerkraut was when I was working at a sandwich shop in college. The rule was if you showed up late you had to make the “sauerkraut.” It was kind of awful because the sauerkraut was pre-made and came in a giant can, and once you got past the smell, you had to mix it with mayonnaise. Needless to say, it was one of my least favorite tasks and a major motivator to get to work on time.
This sauerkraut, however, is nothing like that. It’s homemade from scratch with simple ingredients to help promote a healthy gut (and there’s no mayonnaise in sight). Plus, it’s super easy to master the technique and requires just 7 simple ingredients. Shall we?

The simplest form of sauerkraut is just cabbage and salt, which is where we start in this recipe.
Once the salt is added, simply massage with clean hands for 10 minutes or until the cabbage has reduced quite a bit in size and released quite a bit of liquid at the base of the bowl. See the progression in the next two photos.


We’re looking good! Now, let’s add some color and flavor.
I went with shredded carrots and beets, which provide a vibrant orange-magenta hue. Next come fresh minced garlic and fresh grated ginger and turmeric for big flavor. The result is a perfectly salted fresh vegetable sauerkraut infused with zesty garlic and ginger and earthy turmeric. Swoon!
Mix again to incorporate and you’ve practically made sauerkraut!

All that’s left to do is pack into sterilized jars and ensure the liquid extracted from all that massaging rises up and covers the kraut for optimum fermentation. Then leave it alone to do its thing. Set it on the counter out of direct sunlight or in a cabinet for 1-14 days (or longer) to let it naturally ferment.

We hope you LOVE this kraut! It’s:
Tangy
Crunchy
Fresh
Filled with probiotics
Garlicky
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect topper for sandwiches, salads, wraps, bowls, and more! Our favorite way to enjoy sauerkraut is with dishes like Kitchari or Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. But it’s even tasty right out of the jar (just don’t double dip to avoid contamination).

","Sterilize any equipment you will be using for fermentation, especially the jars (we prefer using mason jars or these Weck Jars that are about 850 ml). It is extremely important that everything is sterilized to allow for proper fermentation. Do so easily by pouring boiling water over clean jars and lids and drying completely. Let come back to room temperature before adding ingredients.Add finely grated cabbage (we used our mandolin) to a large mixing bowl and top with 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt (or the lower end of the suggested range if making a different batch size). Wash hands thoroughly and massage cabbage for ten minutes. The cabbage should start softening, shrinking in size, and releasing water (see photo). Continue massaging until this happens.Add shredded beet, carrot, ginger, turmeric, and garlic and massage once more with clean hands for 4-5 minutes until thoroughly combined (see photo). Then taste test and adjust flavor, adding more salt for saltiness, grated ginger for more zing, or garlic for more intense garlic flavor.Use your clean hands to put the sauerkraut mixture into your sterilized jars and press down firmly to pack. There should be enough liquid from the massaging to rise up and cover the vegetables. If this doesn't happen, top with filtered water until covered (it is unlikely that you will need to add water).Also, make sure there is plenty of room (about 1 1/2 inches) between the contents and the lid so it has room to expand. Seal with a lid and set on the counter where there's not much direct sun exposure or in a cabinet. The ideal temperature for fermentation is above 65 degrees F (18 C), so try to keep your environment on the warmer side to encourage proper fermentation.Fermentation can happen as quickly as 24 hours if your space is hot, or it take as long as 2 weeks, (again, depending on the environment). We found our sweet spot to be about 10 days.During this fermentation process, open your jars once per day to release air (you should feel pressure release and see air bubbles when you open the jars). Press down with a sterilized object such as a spoon or the bottom of a drinking glass to ensure that the vegetables are still completely covered in the liquid. Doing so helps encourage proper fermentation.The longer it sits and ferments, the tangier it will become, so sample occasionally with a clean utensil to test and see if it is at the right stage for you. Once it has reached the desired tanginess, cover securely and transfer to the fridge, where it should keep at least 3 months and up to 6 months. When serving, don't double dip to avoid contamination."
71,Vegan Peanut Butter No-Bake Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter No-Bake Cookies


Behold: the no-bake cookie of my dreams. Peanut buttery, chocolatey, fudgy, and ready in 1 pot and 25 minutes!

The base for this cookie is maple syrup, coconut oil, and cocoa powder, which are cooked down into a thick chocolate sauce.
Then it’s time to add the vanilla, peanut butter, oats, and dark chocolate! Dark chocolate not only helps these cookies set and harden, but also adds fudgy flavor and texture.
To keep this recipe naturally-sweetened, simply use bittersweet or naturally-sweetened dark chocolate (such as Eating Evolved).

Once your cookie dough is formed, scoop into cookies and let cool. The hardest part was not eating one (or three) while they were cooling. But be patient! They’re worth the wait.


We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Rich
Fudgy
Salty-sweet
Studded with oats
Easy to make
&amp; Seriously delicious
These cookies would make the perfect healthier treat to have on hand during the week. They would also be a great road trip snack! Personally, I prefer freezing a batching and pulling out one whenever a sweet craving strikes.

72,The Best Whole Roasted Cauliflower | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Whole Roasted Cauliflower (5 Ingredients!)


Behold, the whole roasted cauliflower.
This recipe, while it may seem straightforward, threw me for a loop. I roasted 7 heads of cauliflower until I got it just right! But in the end, it was totally worth the effort.
There are a couple of secrets to the whole roasted cauliflower game. Let me show you how!

This recipe is easy, requiring just 5 ingredients and simple methods to prepare!
Tip #1: Start with a sauce comprised of spices, a little oil, maple syrup, and salt. The result is a flavor-packed marinade of sorts that’s perfect for lathering all over your cauliflower.
Tip #2: Flip your cauliflower upside down to let the sauce pour down the core, shake it around so it infuses the center, and then flip the cauliflower over and use a brush to rub the leftover sauce all over the exterior.
Tip #3: Add just a pinch more spice and salt to the exterior for even more flavor.


Tip #4: Place a pan with water on the bottom of your oven while baking so the cauliflower steams and gets softer faster. It doesn’t make the cauliflower soggy as long as you don’t over-bake – just perfectly tender all the way to the core. (A tip we borrowed from NYT.)
Tip #5: Turn the oven to broil at the last minute to get a browned outer edge.
That’s it! Just 5 ingredients and 5 tips to the perfect roasted cauliflower.

We hope you all LOVE this cauliflower! It’s:
Perfectly tender
Packed with flavor
Easy to make
Super versatile
&amp; So delicious
Make this cauliflower as the main dish or an appetizer for dinner parties or weeknight meals! Because cauliflower doesn’t have many calories, we recommend serving it over some cooked quinoa with our go-to Chimichurri Sauce. You could also add our Actually Crispy Chickpeas to the plate for some added fiber and crunch!
Other sides that would be amazing with this dish are Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, Super Cleansing Slaw with Rosemary Tahini Dressing, Loaded Kale Salad,Butternut Squash Sweet Potato Gratin, and Romesco Soup with Smashed Chickpeas.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Also fill a small baking pan halfway with water and set on the floor (bottom) of the oven. This will provide steam to help the cauliflower cook more evenly.Rinse and dry the head of cauliflower and carefully cut off the bottom stalk without removing too much of the core. You want the entire head intact for baking. Peel away any remaining green leaves and place in a cast-iron skillet (or other oven-safe pan).In a mixing bowl, mix together avocado oil or melted coconut oil, water, shawarma spice blend, harissa paste (optional), maple syrup, and salt. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more shawarma for smoky flavor, harissa paste (optional) for spiciness, maple syrup for sweetness, or salt for more intense overall flavor.Flip your cauliflower upside down and pour on most of the sauce. Let the sauce pour down the core, shake it around so it infuses the center, and then flip the cauliflower over and use a brush to rub the leftover sauce (including any that seeped into the pan) all over the exterior for maximum flavor. Place cauliflower core-side down before baking and add an extra pinch of salt and spice blend to the exterior for extra flavor.Place skillet in oven and roast for 35-50 minutes (depending on size of cauliflower) or until a knife easily pierces the core. If you prefer softer cauliflower, then roast for longer. For cauliflower with a little bite, roast for less time.To brown the exterior, increase heat to high broil and roast 2-4 more minutes, watching carefully as not to burn.Remove from oven and enjoy as is or garnish with desired sauces and sides. We went for quinoa cooked with curry powder.Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator up to 4 days. Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until hot."

75,Spicy Vegan Jackfruit Tacos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Jackfruit Tacos (1-Pot Meal!)


Friends, the time has come to share this STUNNER of a new recipe with you.
Say hello to these SPICY Jackfruit Tacos that come together in less than 45 minutes in 1 pan! Huzzah!

The base for the tacos is jackfruit, which is rinsed, sorted, and chopped. The flavor comes in waves from onion, garlic, lime, chipotle peppers in adobo, and smoky spices.
The key to this recipe is infusing tons of flavor, adding enough moisture on the front end so the jackfruit “marinates” while cooking, and then turning up the heat near the end so you get a bit of a caramelized effect. Major swoon!
Once it’s cooked, it’s time to dig. We went with corn tortillas, refried black beans, pepitas, cilantro, cabbage, and hot sauce.

﻿
We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s:
Spicy
Smoky
Flavorful
Comforting
Easy to make
&amp; Insanely delicious
While we enjoyed the jackfruit as taco filling, it would also work well with things like Vegan Nachos, Burritos, Taco Salads, and more!

","Thoroughly rinse and drain jackfruit. Then begin sorting. The pieces come in chunks or triangle shapes. Cut off the center ""core"" portion of the jackfruit that's tougher in texture and separate it from the rest of the fruit. Then chop into smaller pieces. For the remaining portion of the jackfruit that appears more stringy, use your hands to pull into small shredded pieces. You're basically trying to get the jackfruit into small, shredded/chopped pieces. Rinse the jackfruit once more in a colander, drain, and thoroughly dry.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil of choice, onion, and garlic. Sauté for 4-5 minutes or until onions are golden brown and softened.Add jackfruit, salt, paprika, cumin, chili powder, coconut sugar (starting with 2 Tbsp // or less if making a smaller batch), chipotle peppers and their adobo sauce (starting with 1 pepper and working your way up), coconut aminos, water, and lime juice. Stir to coat and reduce heat to low - medium. Cover and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.For finer texture, as your jackfruit is cooking, use your spoon to mash the jackfruit into smaller pieces, or use two forks to shred the jackfruit as it cooks down. This will create a more realistic “meat-like” texture.Once the jackfruit has been properly simmered, taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more paprika or cumin for smokiness, chili powder for heat, chipotle pepper or adobo sauce for spice, coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweetness, coconut aminos for saltiness / depth of flavor, or lime for acidity.Turn up heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 more minutes to get a little extra color/texture. Then remove from heat.Enjoy as is, on top of salads or nachos, or in enchiladas, burritos, tacos! We prefer corn tortillas, refried black beans, jackfruit, cabbage, cilantro, and hot sauce!Store leftover jackfruit up to 4-5 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. To reheat, heat on a skillet until hot and moisten with more water if it appears dry."
76,30-Minute Quinoa Fried Rice | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Quinoa “Fried Rice”


When visiting Mexico recently, we found a little gem in the heart of Puerto Vallarta called Salud Super Food. They had tons of delicious smoothies, perfect oats, and bowls. Their Mediterranean quinoa bowl struck my eye one day, and I’m so glad I gave it a try. The veggies were perfectly seasoned and saucy, and I managed to get my daily serving of greens in one bowl!
But my biggest takeaway?They’d gotten the quinoa perfectly crispy, almost like it’d been cooked and then stir-fried to get that crispy golden crunch.
‘Ding, ding, ding!’ A light bulb went off in my head for “quinoa fried rice” and one of the first things I did when I got home was get in the kitchen and test this recipe.
Good news! It totally worked. Let me show you how easy it is!

This dish requires just 10 ingredients andless than 30 minutesto prepare when your quinoa is prepared ahead of time. If you’re like us, you have leftover quinoa in the fridge most days.
Chopped vegetables get sautéed while you mix up a delicious almond butter-based sauce with coconut aminos for depth of flavor, lime juice, and maple syrup. Dried chilies or chili garlic sauce add a bit of heat, while chopped green onion adds freshness and a pop of color.

Once your veggies are tender, simply add your quinoa and sauce and stir-fry until the quinoa is nice and crispy!

﻿
We hope you LOVE this dish!
Quick + easy
Fresh
Flavorful
Customizable
Nutrient-packed
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal – or one to make ahead of time and enjoy as leftovers. For a little more crunch and staying power, we added some cashews. But you could also add something like Marinated Peanut Tempeh orCrispy Peanut Tofu!

","If you haven’t prepared quinoa yet (*prep/cook time does not include making quinoa), do so first by adding rinsed quinoa to a large saucepan and toasting over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 18 minutes or until water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Transfer cooked quinoa to a glass bowl or storage container and refrigerate (uncovered) to cool. Once completely cooled, cover. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month.In the meantime, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, lime for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, almond butter for nuttiness, or coconut aminos for saltiness and depth of flavor. Set aside.Heat a large skillet (or wok) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add sesame oil (or water), carrots, and one third of the coconut aminos. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Carrots take the longest to cook through, so they need a little time on their own.Next, add chopped green onion, broccoli, and cashews (optional), along with another one third of the coconut aminos. Stir, cover, and cook for 2 minutes or until broccoli appears slightly browned.Add cooked quinoa and the remaining one third of the coconut aminos. Stir to coat and cook for 1 minute. Then add sauce and stir.Cook for another 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

I couldn’t make enchilada sauce and not make enchiladas. It just doesn’t make sense.
And because I’ve somehow never put sweet potatoes in enchiladas (practically my favorite food), it had to be done. May we present EPIC Sweet Potato Black Bean (+ Kale!) Enchiladas!? Let us show you how it’s done.

This 9-ingredient recipe starts with perfectly roasted sweet potatoes cubed and tossed with smoky spices.
While that’s happening, prepare your black beans, kale, andEnchilada Sauce (If you haven’t already).

Once your sweet potatoes are roasted, toss with beans, kale, and a little enchilada sauce for extra flavor.
If you want, you can also add some store-bought vegan cheddar cheese – but we didn’t find it necessary.All that’s left to do is fill, roll, and bake to perfection!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven.Add cubed sweet potato to one large baking sheet (or more as needed) and drizzle with oil (or water), cumin, paprika, and salt. Toss to combine.Bake for 20-25 minutes or until sweet potatoes are fork tender and slightly caramelized. Set aside to cool. Also reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (176 C).In the meantime, add your kale to a large cast-iron or metal skillet over medium heat with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water. Cover and steam for about 4-5 minutes or until kale is slightly softened but still vibrant green. Uncover and set aside. (You could also sauté the kale in a bit of oil if you prefer.)Add drained black beans to a mixing bowl with steamed kale and roasted sweet potatoes. Add the smaller measurement of enchilada sauce to the kale and sweet potatoes and stir to combine.Wrap tortillas in damp cloth towel and microwave to warm for 30 seconds to make more pliable. (Alternatively, place wrapped tortillas directly on oven rack for a few minutes to heat through.) This will help them become more pliable and easy to roll.Pour about one third of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch (3 quart | or similar shaped) baking dish. Spread to coat.Lay one corn tortilla down in the saucy dish to coat. Then flip it over to coat the other side. Fill with ~1/3 cup of the filling. Then roll up and lay seam-side down at the edge of the dish. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled, adding more sauce as needed to moisten tortillas. Add any remaining filling to the edges of the dish. If you run out of space to roll the tortillas in the baking dish, continue saucing, filling, and rolling them on a small serving plate.Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the enchiladas in a stripe down the middle. TIP: Use less sauce for slightly drier enchiladas. The more sauce you use, the more tender the tortillas will become.Bake at 350 degrees F (176C) for 15-20 minutes or until warmed through. Top with desired toppings and serve. We went with fresh jalapeño, cilantro, and avocado crema (recipe below), but these enchiladas are delicious on their own!Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month, though best when fresh.

If you’re in the mood for a grill-friendly recipe, look no further.
We’ve taken our love for tempeh to new depths with this Thai-inspired Tempeh Satay. It’s extremely flavorful, easy to make, and perfect for adding to just about any noodle or salad dish. Let’s do this!

This 10-ingredient recipe starts with a flavorful marinade infused with lemongrass, peanut butter, chili, garlic, turmeric, and lime. The result is a tasty, sweet, vibrant sauce that’s perfect for infusing the tempeh.
The lovely thing about this recipe is it can be prepared on the grill, on the grill top, or in the oven depending on what equipment you have. It doesn’t have to be skewered either if that’s easier. The real magic is in the sauce (googly eyes).

We grilled our tempeh on the stovetop (using this grill pan) for a bit of caramelization before popping them into the oven to finish baking. The result is tempeh that’s tender, infused with flavor, and slightly browned on the edges.

We hope you LOVE this tempeh! It’s:

","To reduce bitterness in the tempeh, add to rimmed skillet or saucepan filled with 1 inch of water and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Steam tempeh (uncovered) for a total of 10-12 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point.Rinse, pat dry, and cut into bite-size pieces. I prefer slicing the tempeh in half lengthwise then cutting into triangles or rectangles. Keep in mind they need to be thick and large enough to add to skewers (if using). Set aside.Make marinade by adding all ingredients (chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, peanut butter, coconut aminos, lime juice, maple syrup, turmeric (optional), garlic, salt, and lemongrass) to a food processor. Blend until thoroughly combined.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or coconut aminos or salt for saltiness. Don't be shy - you want this extremely flavorful!Add the sliced tempeh to the marinade and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 24 hours. I found that 24 hours infused the most flavor! While marinating, toss/stir occasionally to ensure even coating. It's best if the tempeh is marinated in a bag or a shallow dish to ensure all pieces are submerged in the marinade.Once marinated, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat. Carefully add tempeh to grill/oven-safe skewers and arrange on your baking sheet. Reserve any leftover marinade to brush/serve with the tempeh once baked. (If skipping skewers, proceed to step 8 by placing tempeh directly on baking sheet unskewered.)Heat a grill or grill pan until very hot and brush surface with sesame or coconut oil to help prevent sticking. Once hot, add the skewers of tempeh and cook on both sides for about 4 minutes or until grill marks appear.Place skewers back on baking sheet. Drizzle them with a bit more coconut aminos and leftover marinade for extra flavor. Optional but recommended!Bake for 20-30 minutes at 375 F (190 C) or until deep golden brown, flipping once at the halfway point for even cooking.

81,No-Bake Vanilla Cake Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Vanilla Cake Bites


Have you ever tasted something so delicious it sent you straight back to your childhood or reminded you of an entirely different dish?
This was my exact experience when I popped one of these energy bites into my mouth. I thought, “Wow, this tastes like cake batter – like vanilla cake!” And thus, these vanilla cake bites were born.
These aren’t your average cake bites. They’re made with 6 wholesome ingredients andareoil-free, grain-free, and refined-sugar free!
Yep, exciting stuff. Let’s get started!

The base of this recipe is dates, which are blended into a sticky ball and then set aside. Next come your dry ingredients: walnuts, coconut flour, and almond flour.
Pulse into a meal and then add your dates back in. Before you know it, you have cake batter on your hands (you know, healthy cake batter).


All that’s left to do is scoop, roll into balls, and indulge. You can also choose to leave them unrolled for a more rustic “cookie dough” vibe.
Either leave plain or roll in coconut flakes for the ultimate healthier treat. Personally, we loved the addition of coconut and highly recommend it!

We hope you LOVE these cake bites! They’re:
Rich
Naturally sweet
Nutrient-packed
So satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
These would make the perfect snack or healthier dessert! We loved enjoying a couple midafternoon with some tea or golden milk. Swoon.

","Add pitted dates to a food processor and mix until small bits remain or a ball forms. Remove from food processor and set aside.To the food processor, add the walnuts, almond flour, coconut flour, and sea salt. Blend until a semi-fine meal is achieved. Add dates back in (in bite-sized pieces) as well as the vanilla extract. Pulse until a loose dough forms. Be careful not to over-blend. You're looking for a pliable dough, not a purée.Scoop out 2-Tablespoon amounts using a cookie scooper (like this one) and roll into balls with hands or release lever on scoop and place directly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat until all dough is used up. Roll in finely shredded coconut or leave as is. Store in refrigerator or freezer. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month. You could also press the ""dough"" into a loaf or 8x8-inch cake pan and slice into bars."
82,Peanut Butter Banana Green Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Banana Green Smoothie Bowl


From time to time, I love sharing a recipe I’ve been making organically in my kitchen and enjoying on a regular basis. This smoothie is one of those recipes.
It all started with an obsession for banana and peanut butter, which goes way back to my favorite green smoothie.
Since then, my taste has become slightly more sophisticated and I’ve been enjoying more adaptogen and green powders in my smoothies for an extra boost of nutrition.
We hope you love this smoothie bowl. It’s perfect for all you peanut butter banana lovers out there who also love a healthy dose of greens.

The recipe happens in your blender in about 5 minutes.
Banana is blended with cauliflower and blueberries for a creamy, perfectly sweet base. Then add in a big handful of greens, a healthy dose of peanut (or your favorite nut/seed) butter for saltiness and protein, and dairy-free milk.
For a little extra nutrition, we added hemp seeds for healthy fats and protein, spirulina for detoxification, maca to help balance hormones, and ashwagandha to help the body adapt to stress.
Not to worry, these add-ins don’t really affect the flavor because the banana and peanut butter combo still shine through (phew).

We hope you love this smoothie bowl. It’s:
Creamy
Packed with nutrients + vitamins
Naturally sweet
Peanut buttery
Quick &amp; Easy
Customizable
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect snack or breakfast, especially during warmer months. It’s light and refreshing yet totally satisfying. Top yours off with a little granola for even more staying power.

For a thicker smoothie bowl, add less milk. For a thinner smoothie bowl, add more milk.Taste flavor and adjust if desired, adding more peanut butter for saltiness or banana for sweetness. Spirulina or more spinach will add a deeper green hue.Divide between serving bowls and garnish with toppings of choice. We went with oil-free granola, rawnola, and more frozen blueberries.Best when fresh. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Freeze into ice cubes for longer-term storage (~1 month) and add to future smoothies."
83,Vegan Cauliflower Rice Kitchari | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Cauliflower Rice Kitchari


If you haven’t caught on by now, we’re super into comfort food over here. And when it comes to Indian cooking, it doesn’t get much more comforting than kitchari.
Kitchari is a traditional Ayurvedic dish that’s typically made when someone in the family is under the weather. That’s because it’s comforting, gentle on the digestive system, and incredibly soothing.
Our inspired take on this flavorful dish uses cauliflower rice in place of basmati rice and can be served atop greens, grains, or roasted vegetables. It’s perfect for just about any occasion (whether you’re sick or not). Let us show you how easy this 1-pot meal is.

The one time-consuming thing about this recipe is that you need to soak your moong dal – a.k.a. split mung beans – beforehand, which takes about 6-8 hours. This increases the digestibility and speeds up cooking time.
Once soaked, it’s smooth sailing. It all starts with toasting your whole spices along with fresh ginger, serrano pepper, and diced tomato.


Next comes the soaked moong dal, which is sautéed and then simmered in water until tender.
Once tender, it’s time to add your cauliflower rice and more spices for big flavor. (We also include an option for basmati rice in the notes if you’re down with grains).
Cover and simmer until all of the flavors meld, and before you know it, dinner is on the table. We did it! You did it. Friends, we did it.

We hope you LOVE this kitchari. It’s:
Comforting
Flavorful
Hearty
Soothing
Fiber- + Protein-rich
&amp; Incredibly delicious
This is the perfect dish to make ahead of time and reheat throughout the week. It just gets better with time. Make it for yourself or loved ones who are sick – it’s like a hug. Make it for dinner parties. Your friends will love you for it. Our favorite way to enjoy it is with roasted sweet potatoes and beets – because carbs – and some fresh cilantro. Take it to another level with this green curry tahini dressing. Swoon!

84,How to Make Hummus from Scratch | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Hummus From Scratch


Once you master the art of cooking beans, the world is your oyster. You can save money, control the ingredients you add to your food, and generally feel like a boss in the kitchen.
With that in mind, allow us to demonstrate how easy it is to make your own hummus –from scratch!

This 6-ingredient recipes starts with quick-soaking your chickpeas – which takes about 1 hour. And then cooking, which takes 1 more hour. Just like that you went from dry chickpeas to cooked chickpeas in 2 hours. You’re already a pro!

Once your chickpeas are tender, drain and add them to a food processor.Throw in some garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and salt – the basics. A little olive oil adds creaminess and flavor, but it can be subbed with water if you’re avoiding oil.

Blend until creamy and smooth. Then add in fresh herbs or any other flavor you crave: think roasted jalapeño, roasted red pepper, lots of basil, lots of cilantro, or even curry paste! The sky is the limit.

We hope you LOVE this hummus! It’s:
Creamy
Hearty
Lemony
Garlic-infused
Easy to make
Customizable
&amp; SO delicious
Keep this hummus on hand when you need a quick snack or spread. Our favorite way to enjoy hummus recently has been on top of gluten-free toast. Spread with hummus and then top with mashed avocado, nutritional yeast, and pepper flake! Next-level avocado toast!

Enjoy as is with vegetables, pita, or crackers."
85,Thai Yellow Cauliflower Chickpea Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Yellow Chickpea Cauliflower Curry


While visiting our palJeanetterecently in LA, I had a curried chickpea dish at Vibe that left me craving all the flavors when I got back home.
So I got to work and kept things simple. This dish requires just 30 minutes and 1 pot to create. It’s really stripped down to the essentials while keeping big flavor intact! Let’s cook, friends.

It all starts with sautéed shallot, garlic, ginger, and serrano pepper. Then we throw in the ultimate flavor punch – red curry paste! Look at all that goodness. Swoon.
Next, we add in some coconut milk for creaminess and natural sweetness. And for even more depth of flavor, we included coconut aminos (or tamari) and turmeric.


The heartiness comes from plenty of chopped cauliflower and cooked chickpeas, which simmer away until tender. That’s it! It’s meal time.

We hope you LOVE this curry! It’s:

Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.Add curry paste (starting with the smallest suggested amount and adding more later if needed) and stir. Cook for 2 minutes more. Add coconut milk (see photo), turmeric, maple syrup or coconut sugar (optional), coconut aminos (or tamari), and stir.

86,Creamy Vegan Golden Milk Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Golden Milk Smoothie


If you’re into golden milk, this smoothie is a must-try! It requires 7 wholesome ingredients (you likely have on hand right now), 1 blender, and 5 minutes to make. Let’s do this!

The base of this smoothie is frozen banana for natural sweetness and a creamy texture. We tested other fruits and nothing quite worked. But if you’re trying (or prefer) to avoid banana, we include another option in the notes!
For anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,and digestion benefits, we included plenty of fresh ginger and ground turmeric. Black pepper boosts the absorption of turmeric, so we added that as well. And don’t forget cinnamon for more natural sweetness and warmth.
Coconut milk keeps things super creamy, and as an optional touch, we threw in some fresh carrot juice to balance the banana flavor and provide an even more intense orange (golden) hue.


We hope you LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Naturally sweet
Anti-inflammatory
Quick + easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect quick breakfast or snack. For a little extra protein, add in some hemp seeds or protein powder of choice. And for the real deal, check out our5-Minute Vegan Golden Milk!

Good news! All of the most delicious things on the planet no longer require oil (apparently). Likeroasted vegetables, french fries, and cake! Now granola?
Cool things are happening, people. Cool things are happening.

This easy, naturally sweetened granola requires simple methods and just 9 basic ingredients!
It all starts with aquafaba, or chickpea brine, that’s been whipped until light and fluffy. This mocks egg whites, coats the granola, and helps it become crispy without any added oil! Magic.
﻿

Next comes your dry ingredients. We kept things pretty classic with oats, coconut, chia seeds, and nuts. But it will work with just about any combination of these ingredients – and it’ll likely even workgrain-free if that’s your thang.

Once mixed, it’s time for the oven. Bake at a low-ish temp for about 30 minutes and you’re in the money – ya know, granola money!

We hope you LOVE this granola! It’s:
Crispy
Crunchy
Golden brown
Naturally sweet

Stir to combine.Add aquafaba (chickpea brine) to a mixing bowl and use an electric mixer to whip into loose peaks (see photo). This can take up to 10 minutes, usually 5. (If it has trouble blending, add a little cream of tartar to help peaks form.)Add maple syrup and vanilla (optional) to the aquafaba and beat for 30 seconds more. Pour the aquafaba mixture over the dry ingredients and fold to coat (see photo).Spread the mixture evenly onto a parchment-lined baking sheet(s) and bake for 28-35 minutes (or until fragrant and deep golden brown). Stir a bit near the halfway point and flip the pan around to ensure even baking.Let cool completely. Then add dried fruit (optional) and toss.

88,Probiotic-Cultured Vegan Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Probiotic-Cultured Vegan Cheese


We’ve made vegan cheese before (Vegan Garlic Herb Cheese + Spicy Pimento Cheese Ball), but not like this. This version has the good stuff in it – probiotics! That means you’re helping your gut while you’re indulging. How cool is that?

The base for this 6-ingredient cheeseis either soaked cashews or slivered almonds! That’s right – two ways. It’s magic.
Once soaked, the cashews are blended until creamy and smooth with delicious things like fresh garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt. Mmm, it’s already looking tasty.


Next come the probiotics! You’ll add these in after blending and stir until combined.
Just as with our 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt, probiotics combined with liquids (or cheese in this instance) culture when left at room temperature.This means the good bacteria are mingling all up in it, intensifying the tanginess and flavor!
Once it’s mixed, simply wrap in a towel or cheesecloth and let it hang out on your counter for 24-72 hours. The longer it sits, the tangier and firmer it becomes. We found 48 hours to be our sweet spot.

We hope you LOVE this cheese! It’s:
Creamy
Rich
Tangy
Easy to make
Versatile
&amp; Seriously delicious!
This would make the perfect appetizer for parties or friend dinners. It would also be a delicious snack or side to just about any meal!

","Place cashews in a bowl and cover with cool water. Soak for at least 6 hours. In a pinch, soak in very hot water for 1 hour. If using almonds, no need to soak!Once soaked, drain cashews thoroughly and add to food processor (if using almonds, add unsoaked to a high-speed blender for creamiest texture). Add minced garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt and process until very creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Add the water a little at a time until a creamy consistency is reached.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, garlic for zing, or salt for saltiness.Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl and add probiotic capsules. Stir to combine with a wooden or plastic spoon (not metal, as it can tamper with the effectiveness of the probiotics).Place a fine mesh strainer (or colander) over a small or medium mixing bowl and lay down two layers of cheesecloth (or a clean, fine, absorbent towel).Use a spatula to scoop the cheese mixture over the cheesecloth. Then gather the corners and gently twist the top to form the cheese into a ""disc."" Secure with a rubber band.Leave to set on the countertop at room temperature for at least 24 hours, up to 72. We found 48 hours to be the sweet spot. The longer it sits, the firmer and tangier it will become.Once the cheese has cultured enough for taste, transfer to the refrigerator to set for at least 6 hours to firm/harden and chill.To serve, carefully unwrap from cheesecloth and gently invert onto a serving platter. Reform with hands or cheesecloth as needed. Then coat with chopped herbs, black pepper, or spice mix (optional). It can be fragile, so handle gently.Enjoy chilled with crackers or vegetables. Cheese will hold its form for several hours out of the refrigerator, but best when chilled. Leftovers keep well covered in the refrigerator up to 7 days (sometimes longer) - you'll know it's bad when mold has formed or the taste is no longer appetizing."
89,Cheesy Chili Oil-Free French Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cheesy Chili Baked Potato Fries (Oil-Free!)


Ready for your new favorite snack or side? Allow us to present this easy, 5-ingredient recipe that delivers crispy, cheesy potato fries that happen to be oil-free. Let’s do this!

The recipe starts with potatoes sliced into thin wedges. We love a heartier, thicker wedge “fry.” But if you’re into thinner fries, cut into more of a classic shape.
To get the inside tender and not burn the exterior, start by steaming your potatoes. We adapted this method from our Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables recipe! It works like a charm and partially cooks the potatoes to not only speed the cooking time, but also ensure the insides are fluffy and tender.

Next, it’s time for spices! For big cheesy flavor, we went with nutritional yeast and sea salt. And for a little heat, we opted for chili powder. After a short bake in the oven, you’re good to go!

We hope you LOVE these baked fries! They’re:
Crispy on the outside
Tender on the inside
Cheesy
Salty
Spicy
&amp; SO easy to make
These potatoes would make the perfect side or snack, especially on game days or if you’re in need of some serious carbs! They’re delicious on their own, but they also pair well with dips like Ketchup, Garlicky Guacamole, or even Jalapeño Vegan Queso!
These “wedge” style fries are perfect for dipping. But if you’re looking for “skinny” fries, check out our Garlicky Matchstick Fries! Also delicious.

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line two (or more as needed) baking sheets with parchment paper.Slice potatoes into small wedges about 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide. Place in a steamer basket or large colander set over a pot of boiling water. Cover and then steam approximately 5 minutes until slightly tender but not cooked.Transfer to baking sheets and top with nutritional yeast, chili powder, garlic powder, sea salt, cayenne pepper (optional), and any other desired seasonings (see photo). Toss gently to coat.Arrange in an even layer on baking sheet, trying not to overlap, so that fries can get crispy. The more room they have, the crispier they will become. Use two baking sheets if needed.Bake for 15 minutes. Then remove from oven and increase heat to 450 degrees F (232 C). Flip to ensure even baking on both sides and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until crispy and golden brown.Serve hot! They're delicious as is, but they're elevated tossed in fresh herbs and garlic (optional) and served with ketchup or guacamole. Best fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days.

92,How to Make Perfect Steel Cut Oats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Perfect Bowl of Oats


Ah, the perfect bowl of oatmeal – a thing to behold.
When we’re sick, craving comfort food, or just want something extra hearty for breakfast, this is our go-to meal.
In the hundreds of times we’ve made oats, we’ve found some tricks that elevate the texture, flavor, and tenderness, and we’re stoked to share those with you today. Shall we?

This recipe requires 4 ingredients, 1 pot, and simple methods to prepare.
Our top tip is to SOAK. Now, if you can’t find the time to soak your oats ahead of time, that’s fine. We’ve got shortcuts for you in the notes. But if you know you’re having oats the next day, the best way to get dreamy oats is by soaking them overnight in cool water.
Soaking not only softens the oats, but it also makes them more tender, quicker to cook, and easier to digest. In a side-by-side comparison, we found that unsoaked oats lacked that fluffy, creamy texture soaked oats provide. So, from here on out, we’ll be soaking.
Once they’re soaked, it’s time to cook. Simply bring oats to a low boil. Then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until tender.


Lastly, add in your sweetener of choice, along with cinnamon and flaxseed.
For toppings, we can’t resist our go-to Berry Compote(we add chia seeds at the end for thickening + healthy fats!), hemp seeds, nut butter, and banana. Seriously dreamy.

We hope you LOVE these oats! They’re:
Easy to make
Fluffy
Tender
Creamy
Naturally sweetened
Nutritious
&amp; SO delicious
These oats make the perfect weekday or lazy weekend breakfast. They’re super versatile as well! In the fall, top with roasted apples. In the summer, go with fresh berries or compote. In the spring, go with oranges! The options are endless.

","Add 1 cup oats to a large saucepan and top with 2 cups water (or, if making more or less, just make sure there is double the water as there are oats). Cover and soak for 6 hours or overnight (see notes for shortcuts). This will improve digestibility and also slightly speed cooking time. It also yields fluffier, creamier oats!The following day (or 6 hours later), add a pinch of salt and bring to bubbling boil over high heat. Once bubbling, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 12-15 minutes or until the water is mostly absorbed and the oats are tender. If the oats appear dry, add more water as needed. Then remove from heat.Scrape any oats off the bottom that may have stuck to the pan. Add in flaxseed meal (optional), sweetener of choice, and cinnamon. Stir once more to combine. For creamier oats, add in a splash of dairy-free milk of choice at this time (optional).To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with any additional garnishes. Our go-to is berry compote with chia seeds, banana, peanut butter, almond milk, and hemp seeds.Best enjoyed fresh. Store leftovers covered in refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat on stovetop with water or dairy-free milk until hot."

If there are raisins in my granola, you will no doubt see me meticulously picking them out and setting them on the side of my plate. No, thanks. And my go-to movie theatre snack? It will never be Raisinettes. Yeah, no.
However, the one exception I will make is when cinnamon is involved. Anything cinnamon raisin is A-OK in my book. So when I sampled some cinnamon raisin peanut butterrecently, I knew it was due time to make my own. I couldn’t resist! Let’s do this.

This 5-ingredient recipe starts with roasted unsalted peanuts. Or, if you can’t find unsalted, just omit any additional salt.
These bad guys are whirled around until buttery and smooth. Swoon!


Once creamy, it’s time to add your flavors. We went for a pinch of salt and LOADS of cinnamon. Trust us, 2 Tablespoons seems like a lot, but we started with 1 teaspoon and worked our way up. For some reason, in peanut butter, the cinnamon flavor can get lost, which is why you need so much. Fear not – it’s hard to go overboard.
And for sweetener, we went with a little stevia and maple syrup. Too much liquid sweetener may cause the peanut butter to seize, which is no bueno. So, to avoid that problem, start with a little liquid sweetener (like maple syrup) and then sweeten more with stevia or powdered cane or coconut sugar to taste.

Now it’s raisin time! Add your raisins (and a dash more cinnamon) and pulse until combined. Then go to town. It was love at first bite for us.

We hope you LOVE this peanut butter! It’s:
Creamy
Salty
Cinnamony
Studded with raisins
Naturally sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect spread for toast, crepes, pancakes, waffles, bananas, Banana Splits, oats, smoothies, Coconut Yogurt, cookies, and more!

","Add peanuts to a food processor and process until smooth (it will begin to sound soupy) - approximately 3-5 minutes, scraping down sides as needed.Add sea salt, cinnamon, and sweetener of choice. If using maple syrup, start with 1 Tbsp (15 ml). Adding more than that amount may cause the mixture to seize (liquid and fat don't mix well), which is why we recommend a little stevia and a little maple syrup.Process another 30 seconds to combine. If for some reason your peanut butter doesn’t get smooth, add a little neutral oil, such as avocado or peanut oil (not coconut, as it will harden).Add raisins and pulse a couple of times until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cinnamon for intense cinnamon flavor, sweetener for sweetness, or salt for saltiness..Store leftovers at room temperature for 3-4 weeks. For longer-term storage, store in fridge for up to 2 months or more."
94,Curry-Roasted Fennel Salad & Tahini Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curry-Roasted Fennel Salad with Rosemary Tahini Dressing


So, now that we’ve conquered our fear of fennel (I mean, seriously, what do you do with this ridiculous-looking licorice bomb?), it’s time to move into uncharted, even more delicious territory: salads.
This salad is, in a word, irresistible. We dare you to take just one bite. Let us show you how this 30-minute side or entrée is made!


This start of this salad show is the fennel – curry–roasted fennel to be exact.
If you fear the pungent, licorice-y taste of fennel, roasting it in a little curry powder and salt takes it to tasty town. (But let’s be real – any vegetable roasted in this curry powder is out-of-this-world delicious. What do you expect? So, much, flavor.)


The next step? Dressing.
It was hard to decide on just one, but for simplicity’s sake, we suggest the Rosemary Tahini Dressing from this Amazing Super Cleansing Slaw. The flavors just work.
But, if you’re looking to venture outside of your tahini comfort zone, try this 6-ingredient Vegan Tzatziki! We found that it melded really well with the complex flavor of the curry by adding a nice cooling, refreshing finish. You can’t go wrong either way.
Once your fennel is roasted, it’s assembly time. For even more protein, fiber, and crunch, we opted for a batch of our Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas. To save time, you could also just use cooked (unbaked) chickpeas or grab some already baked at the store.

We hope you LOVE this salad! It’s:
Flavorful
Hearty
Fresh
Crunchy
Easy to make
Versatile
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect side to bring along to dinner parties or serve alongside mains like these Mushroom Black Bean Burgers or Sun-Dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers.Leaving the chickpeas off this salad makes it more of a side for two to four people(in our opinion). But to make it an entrée for two, add the chickpeas (or cooked quinoa!) for extra heartiness.
For more hearty salads, be sure to check out our Loaded Kale Salad, Sweet Potato Avocado Salad, Curry-Roasted Vegetable &amp; Lentil Salad, Mexican-Inspired Salad Cups with Quinoa &amp; Black Beans, and the Abundance Kale Salad with Savory Tahini Dressing.

","If serving with crispy chickpeas, follow the link for instructions and prepare now. Otherwise, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and arrange fennel on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle with curry powder, coconut oil (or water), and sea salt and toss to combine. Spread in an even layer.Roast fennel for about 20 minutes or until tender, golden brown, and slightly crispy on the edges. Set aside.In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding all ingredients (starting with the lesser measurement of water) to a small blender (such as a Magic Bullet) or a mixing bowl and blending or whisking to combine. Add more water as needed until creamy and pourable.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic for zing, lemon for acidity, apple cider vinegar for tanginess, or rosemary for herbal flavor.To serve, arrange greens of choice on a platter or serving bowl and top with red bell pepper, roasted fennel, chickpeas (optional), and any additional garnishes, such as fresh rosemary or lemon slices (optional).Serve with dressing on the side. This salad acts as a side without the chickpeas, and more of an entrée with the chickpeas.Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days. The dressing will keep in the refrigerator up to 6-7 days."
95,Vegan Mango Coconut Yogurt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mango Coconut Yogurt (Coconut Cult Dupe!)


If you want delicious mango coconut yogurt but don’t want to pay $25* for it, this is the recipe for you.
Consider this a fun spin on our 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt to include mango and orange for a thick, tangy, creamy yogurt infused with delicious fruit and vanilla flavor. Serious swoon. Let’s do this!

The base of this 5-ingredient recipe starts with full-fat coconut milk and probiotic pills (brand recommendations for both below!).
Once mixed together, let it hang out at room temperature until thick and tangy – about 48 hours seems to be the sweet spot for us.


Once thickened, it’s time to add the flavor! We loved a dash of vanilla extract (or paste), mango purée, and orange zest or juice. Once refrigerated, the yogurt will become even thicker and richer in flavor – this is key!
Real talk: The reasonCoconut Cult yogurt costs so much is each 16-ounce jar contains 800 billion active probiotic cultures (some of which are human-derived). That’s a lot!
Depending on the brand and quality of probiotic you add, you can get up to that number. But we think anything above 10 billion active cultures is pretty dang awesome (the one we use contains 50 billion). With that said, the cost comparison of 1 16-ounce jar Coconut Cult vs 1 16-ounce jar of our recipe is $24.50 vs. $6.48*(that’s a cost savings of $18.02!).
*This cost estimation is for 1 can Whole Foods 365 full-fat coconut milk, 1 1/2 Renew Life 50 billion probiotic capsules, 1/2 mango, 1/2 orange, and a dash of vanilla. That means you have the same amount of delicious, tangy yogurt for a fraction of the cost. Pretty cool, huh?
P.S. For more yogurt troubleshooting tips, see our original post for 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt.

We hope you LOVE this yogurt! It’s:
Creamy
Tangy
Naturally sweetened
Mango- + Orange-infused
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This yogurt is tasty on its own, but it’s also delicious when added to things like our Coconut Yogurt Cheesecake, Raw Banana Splits, Coconut Yogurt Waffles, or this Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart!

","It's important to select a coconut milk that's creamy and smooth (not grainy or clumpy) to ensure that the yogurt is creamy and smooth. My favorite brands are: Whole Foods 365 full-fat (BPA-free), Aroy-D full-fat, and Thai Kitchen full-fat. Native Forest (BPA-free) isn't as creamy, but it still makes tasty yogurt. I would not recommend Trader Joe's (BPA-free), which was recently reformulated and is now chunky/grainy. The recommended brands' full-fat coconut milks (and coconut cream) also work well for coconut whipped cream! For best results, I recommend using Whole Foods 365 for achieving the creamiest and thickest yogurt.Shake your coconut milk can well. Then open and pour into a clean (sterilized), dry glass jar or bowl. You can easily sterilize clean jars by rinsing throughly in boiling water and letting dry completely. Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like this one from Weck. Often the coconut milk is separated, so once added to the jar, whisk to get it completely smooth.Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics. Stir until creamy and smooth, pushing the probiotic up against the side with your spoon to evenly disperse.Cover the mixture with cheesecloth (or a very thin, clean dish towel - something that lets air in but keeps bugs out) and secure with a rubber band.Let the yogurt activate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours (sometimes longer - 48 hours is my sweet spot for thickness and tang) in a warm place. The longer it rests, the tangier the yogurt will become. In warmer climates and summer, it's easy to make yogurt if your house is warm (75 degrees F / 23 C and above). But in cooler climates or seasons, place the yogurt in the oven with the light on (do not turn on the oven), where it should have the right amount of heat to activate.Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)!NOTE: For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more as as any excess liquid strains to the bottom.To make the mango purée, add cubed mango and orange juice to a small blender or food processor and purée until smooth. Add desired amount of mango purée (we used about half of the prepared amount) to your yogurt along with the vanilla and whisk/stir to combine (this is most easily done in a mixing bowl). Taste and adjust flavor as needed. (Reserve any leftover mango purée for serving with yogurt or for smoothies.)Enjoy immediately or place back in refrigerator to thicken for at least 4-6 hours (which we prefer). Store covered in the refrigerator for several days (mine kept for 7 days). You'll know it's gone bad when the smell is off-putting or there is mold.For more troubleshooting tips, check out our original 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt post!"
96,Cultured Vegan Sour Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cultured Vegan Sour Cream


Tangy vegan sour cream is here! Let us show you how.

This 5-ingredient recipe starts with soaked cashews. Cashews create the perfect creamy, thick base that’s neutral in flavor. Once soaked and blended, add your probiotics to get the culturing process started.


This sour cream does best with a 48-hour rest/culturing time. The longer it rests at room temperature, the thicker and tangier it will become (just like our 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt!).
All that’s left to do is add in your lemon, salt, and apple cider vinegar for flavor and even more tanginess. Swoon!

We hope you LOVE this vegan sour cream! It’s:
Tangy
Thick
Creamy
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
For flavor variations, stir in some adobo sauce or chipotle hot sauce for a smoky, spicy spin or blend with ripe avocado and lime for an avocado crema! This sour cream would be perfect on just about any spicy or Mexican-inspired dish. We loved it on a simple baked sweet potato with avocado and salsa. Add our 1-Pot Black Beans for more protein and fiber!

","Soak cashews in very hot water for 1 hour or in cool water for 6 hours or overnight. Drain.Add drained cashews to a high-speed blender with water and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides of blender as needed.Scrape mixture into a mixing bowl and add probiotic capsules. Stir with a wooden or plastic spoon (not metal as it can react with the probiotics) until fully incorporated.Cover with a piece of cheesecloth or a very thin towel and secure with a rubber band. Let rest on the counter (preferably in a room warmer than 70 degrees F (21 C)) for at least 24 hours or up to 48 hours. The longer it rests, the thicker and tangier it will become. We found 48 hours to be the sweet spot.Once the mixture has reached your preferred tanginess and texture, uncover and add the salt, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar. Stir thoroughly to combine.Taste test and adjust as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, salt for saltiness, or apple cider vinegar for tanginess.Use immediately, or for cold sour cream, chill at least 6 hours. Will keep covered in refrigerator for 5 days, oftentimes longer. You'll know it's gone bad when mold has formed or it no longer smells and tastes appetizing."

98,Super Cleansing Slaw with Rosemary Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Cleansing Slaw with Rosemary Dressing


If you’re in the mood for a tasty, healthy side, snack, or salad base, this recipe is the one for you!
It’s incredibly fresh, colorful, and customizable, and it comes with a new-and-improved tahini dressing. Let’s do this!

This 20-minute recipe starts with shredded fennel, celery, beets, carrots, and fresh parsley and cilantro, which not only creates a hearty base but also provides plenty of health benefits.
Parsley and cilantro help gently lift and remove toxins from the body, including heavy metals, pollution, and more! They’re also both high in vitamins and minerals and very hydrating and nourishing.
Fennel is high in vitamins A + C, calcium, potassium, zinc, copper, and selenium. It’s also high in fiber, which helps promote regularity (ftw).
Celery is high in vitamins B6, C, + K, potassium, and folate. It also has high fiber, water, and electrolyte content, so it’s very hydrating for the body. And its antioxidants and polysaccharides help fight inflammation in the body!


Beetspromote oxygen-rich blood and improvedcirculation. They’re also high in folateas well as amino acids that help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, which in turn helps improve liver function.
Carrotsare abundant in fiber and antioxidants like beta-carotene, which help fight free radicals in the body. They’re also high in magnesium, potassium, and vitamins A, K, + C. The nutrients in carrots also help boost and protect your eyesight!
Applesare packed with antioxidants, flavonoids, and fiber. They’re also high in vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, and phytonutrients that help protect the body from free radicals.
Cabbageis high in free-radical-fighting antioxidantsas well as vitamins K, C, + B6. It also boasts plenty of manganese, potassium, and fiber. Both red and green cabbage work in this recipe, but red will provide slightly more anti-inflammatory benefits due to its higher anthocyanin content.
And the dressing adds a bit of healthy fat and creaminess in the form of tahini, an extra boost of vitamin C from lemon juice, and a little love for your gut from apple cider vinegar. Not to mention garlic, which is antibacterial and anti-parasitic, and rosemary for even more antifungal and antibacterial benefits! Also, this dressing TASTES amazing!

We hope you LOVE this slaw! It’s:

101,Fudgy Vegan Brownie Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Brownie Cookies

A brownie and a cookie IN ONE. Yes, it’s possible! Dreams do come true. Let’s bake, friends!

These quick-and-easy 10-ingredient cookies are adapted from our Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies.
For dry ingredients, we went with cocoa powder, almond flour, coconut sugar, and sea salt. Walnuts and dark chocolate chips add the ultimate brownie factor, while chopped-up dates add more natural sweetness and a sticky, caramel-like surprise to bite into. Swoon!
That means these cookies are not only vegan and gluten-freebut also grain-free and naturally sweetened (if you use naturally-sweetened dark chocolate like Eating Evolved).


We relied on aquafabaas the primary binding ingredient for the cookies as well as for added fluffiness.
Whipped until soft peaks form, the aquafaba is then mixed with a little vanilla, coconut oil, coconut sugar, and melted dark chocolate to constitute the wet ingredients.
When mixed with the dry ingredients, it creates a tacky, semi-wet dough that tastes and smells just like brownies.

After a quick chill in the refrigerator, simply bake for about 15 minutes or until fluffy and dry on the edges. Wait a few minutes to cool (if you can) and then you’ll be diving into these indulgent (yes surprisingly healthy) brownie cookies!

We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Fudgy
Chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
Slightly crisp on the edges
Tender in the center
&amp; SO decadent
These would make a delicious dessert to have on hand throughout the week. And they would also be a fun treat to bring to group dinners or parties! We could also see them packaging up nicely to give as a gift.

","In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, half of the dark chocolate chips, walnuts (optional), cocoa powder, baking powder, sea salt, and coconut sugar. Add in chopped dates and use a whisk to combine / break up dates into the mixture. Set aside.In a separate bowl, beat aquafaba (using a handheld mixer or whisking vigorously) until light and fluffy and loose peaks have formed. (To see aquafaba whipped, check out this Guide to Aquafaba Video.)To the aquafaba, add the melted coconut oil and vanilla and beat or whisk to combine. Then melt the remaining half of the dark chocolate chips in the microwave or over a double boiler and add to the aquafaba. Fold/stir to combine (see photo).Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. You should have a semi-tacky dough. Loosely cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out roughly 1 1/2-Tablespoon amounts of dough (I like this scoop) and place on baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap between each cookie to allow for spreading. Gently press down with palm of hand to form small discs (see photo). Optional: Top with a few more chocolate chips and walnuts.Bake for 14-17 minutes or until puffy and the top no longer feels wet - they should appear mostly dry. Remove from oven and let cool 5-10 minutes. Then carefully loosen with a spatula and set on a wire rack or plate to cool.Enjoy immediately or let cool.

This 30-minute recipe starts with a base of greens, cooked lentils, red grapes, and the star of the show: curry roasted cauliflower.
We tossed one head of cauliflower in a bit of salt, coconut oil (or water), and our DIY Curry Powder (swoon) and roasted it to perfection. The result is crispy-on-the-edge, tender-in-the-center cauliflower bursting with flavor.


Next comes the dressing, which is a mixture of our go-to Green Curry Paste – that color tho! – and tahini, resulting in a creamy, savory-sweet, punchy dressing that marries this salad together beautifully.

Have you ever had a 7-layer bar? If not, have you even lived?
When I was working at a coffee shop many years ago, the baker would often make 7-layer bars to sell, and I’ve had it in the back of my mind for a long time to recreate them “healthier” and vegan. Today is that day, friends. Let’s bake!

The base for this decadent 10-ingredient dessert is an almond-oat crust naturally sweetened with dates and maple syrup that originated from our Creamy Vegan Lemon Bars!
The result is a crispy, salty, slightly sweet crust that makes the perfect foundation for these ooey, gooey bars.


Now that you have one layer down, there are still six layers to go:
Date Caramel
Pecans
Peanut Butter
Coconut Butter
Coconut Flakes
&amp; Chocolate Chips
Total swoon! After a short bake in the oven, your bars are ready to devour (the best part).


We hope you LOVE these bars! They’re:
Crunchy
Gooey
Salty-sweet
Decadent
Rich
Easy to make
&amp; Uber delicious
These would make the perfect dessert for a party, a shower, or a dinner party. They are also great to make and have around the house for something sweet. Although watch out! It’s hard to have just one. ;)

","Prepare crust by preheating oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Line an 8x8-inch baking dish (or use multiple pans if making a larger batch) with parchment paper and extend paper up over the edges.Add oats, almonds, and sea salt to a high-speed blender or food processor. Pulse into a fine meal.Add maple syrup, dates, and coconut oil and pulse until a ""dough"" forms that holds together when you squeeze it between your fingers. If it appears too dry, add more dates or water for moisture.Add crust to the parchment-lined pan and use your hands to spread it into an even layer, pushing the crust up to the edges of the pan so it contains the filling well. To achieve a uniform layer, cover a flat-bottom object (such as a drinking glass) with parchment paper and press down firmly.Bake for 12 minutes. Then remove from oven and set aside.In the meantime, prepare date paste by adding dates to a food processor and blending until small bits remain or a ball forms. Then add water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a spreadable caramel paste forms. Add a pinch of salt and blend once more.Begin layering: To the crust, add date paste and then pecans, peanut butter, coconut butter, coconut flakes, and lastly chocolate chips.Bake for 10-12 minutes more or until the edges are golden brown and the toppings are slightly toasted. Be careful not to burn the coconut flakes.Remove from oven to cool for at least 20 minutes. Then carefully cut and serve warm. Otherwise, let cool until the chocolate and coconut butter are firm - 6 hours or overnight. To speed cooling time, you can also chill in the freezer or refrigerator. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
106,Mushroom Lentil Stew with Mashed Potatoes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lentil Mushroom Stew Over Mashed Potatoes

Friends, prepare yourselves for a hug in the form of a recipe.
Consider this your go-to dish when comfort food is on the brain. Not only is it hearty and satisfying, it’s also simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients and 40 minutes to make (from start to finish). Let’s comfort food!

The base for this dish is a mushroom and lentil gravy/stew.
It starts with sautéed shallot and mushrooms seasoned with coconut aminos, salt, and pepper for rich, deep flavor. Then come lentils, thyme for aromatics, and vegetable broth. As that’s simmering away, start your mashed potatoes.


The mashed potatoes are easy to make as well. Simply peel (or leave skin on for more texture), boil until tender, and mash!
You can go 100 different ways with seasoning mashed potatoes, but we kept things simple: a little salt, pepper, and olive oil, with a few dashes of almond milk for creaminess. SERIOUS yum. For more flavor, you could also add fresh garlic, herbs, or even some vegan parmesan cheese.

All that’s left to do is serve! For garnish, we went for more fresh thyme and a little parsley. Vegan parmesan adds a bit more flavor, but it’s certainly optional.

We hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Super hearty
Comforting
Flavorful
Healthy
Fiber- + Protein-packed
Quick + Easy
&amp; So tasty
This would make a delicious easy weeknight meal for two or a hearty side for four. It’s reminiscent of Shepherd’s Piebut far easier to make! Plus, you can sauce up the filling a bit more so it’s more like mashed potatoes and gravy. Total swoon!

","Heat a large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil or water and shallot and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add mushrooms and coconut aminos and increase heat to medium-high. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.Add thyme, lentils, and 2 cups (480 ml // or the smaller end of the range if adjusting recipe size) vegetable broth. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cook on low for about 20 minutes, adding more broth as needed if the mixture looks dry.In the meantime, add potatoes to a large pot and cover with water so they are just submerged. Bring to a boil on high heat and cook for 12-15 minutes or until they slide off easily when pierced with a knife.Once tender, drain potatoes and add back to pot or a mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of olive oil and mash until tender and fluffy. For added moisture in place of oil, add unsweetened plain almond milk or vegetable broth.Once lentils are tender, taste sauce and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or coconut aminos for saltiness, pepper for spice, or tomato paste for more depth of flavor (optional - we didn't find it necessary). Turn off heat and let the mixture rest so flavors can deepen. Add the 2 Tbsp (30 g // or more as needed) mashed potatoes to the lentil mushroom stew and stir in to thicken.To serve, divide mashed potatoes between serving plates or bowls and top with desired amount of lentil and mushroom gravy. Garnish with fresh parsley, vegan parmesan cheese, or more thyme, if desired.Store leftovers separately, covered, up to 4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer up to 1 month.

If not, do it now! It’s the perfect time to put those gorgeous black beans to use in this EASY, 10-ingredient Roasted Plantain Black Bean Bowl!

The base of this bowl is rice and beans, but the real star of the show in our opinion is the plantains, which are tossed in coconut oil and sea salt and roasted to perfection at high heat. The result is plantains that arecrispy and caramelized on the outside and tender on the inside,and they pair perfectly with the savory, spicy flavors in this bowl.



For serving, the sky is the limit when it comes to toppings. In addition to the easy 2-ingredient cabbage slaw, we went for ripe avocado, lime juice, cilantro, and this AMAZING 5-ingredient Habanero Hot Sauce.

","Prepare a cheesecake pan (I prefer this springform one, but round cake pans or loaf pans work as well) by lining with parchment paper. Set aside.Prepare crust by adding dates to a food processor and blending until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.To the food processor, add walnuts and salt and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing.Add crust to pan and press with fingers to distribute. To pack it down, use a small glass wrapped in parchment paper and really press it down, allowing the crust to come up the sides. Set in freezer to firm up.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth - up to 2 minutes. If it won't come together or appears chunky, add a touch more lemon juice, coconut yogurt, or maple syrup, as the liquid will help it blend better.Scrape down sides as needed and blend until very creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, coconut yogurt for tanginess, or lemon or orange zest for citrus flavor.Add filling to the chilled crust and tap a few times to release any air bubbles. Then loosely cover with plastic wrap or wax paper and freeze until firm - about 6 hours or overnight. Before slicing and serving, let thaw slightly for about 20-30 minutes.Serve as is or top with a touch of coconut whipped cream and/or citrus zest and fresh berries.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for a softer cheesecake up to 4-5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
109,Creamy Vegetable Vegan Risotto | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegetable Risotto (30 Minutes!)

When we traveled to Portugal last year, we ate so much good food.
One of the dishes was a vegetable risotto the restaurant was able to make vegan-friendly by omitting the cheese and butter. Perhaps a cardinal sin in making risotto, but they obliged. One bite in and recipe inspiration was born.

This vegan, gluten-free, oil-free risotto is made with 8 ingredients in 30 minutesfrom start to finish!
It starts with fresh vegetables sautéed until just tender. We went with bell pepper, broccolini, and asparagus, but go with whatever is available and in season for you.
&amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt;

Next, start cooking the risotto by sautéing shallot and then adding arborio rice and white wine for flavor.
Once the wine cooks down, add warmed vegetable broth one ladle at a time and stir as it cooks until “al dente.” Then just add your vegan parmesan cheese and the sautéed vegetables and you’re good to go! It’s that easy.
A few things to keep in mind with risotto:

Always use warmed vegetable broth so it doesn’t halt the cooking when added to the rice.
Stir frequently as the rice cooks to prevent sticking.
Cook the rice at a simmer instead of a boil so the rice can cook slowly and evenly.
Cook until just “al dente” to avoid gummy risotto.


We hope you all LOVE this dish. It’s:
Creamy
“Cheesy”
Flavorful
Loaded with fresh vegetables
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you need something that’s incredibly satisfying and comforting in a hurry. It would make a delicious entrée or side dish, and it would also work well for dinner parties, as it’s a versatile side dish that complements just about any main.

","In a medium saucepan, heat vegetable broth over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep warm.In the meantime, heat a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add half of the water (or oil) and the asparagus (and/or broccolini) and the red bell pepper. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until just tender and slightly browned - 3-4 minutes - stirring frequently. Cover to steam and speed cooking time. Remove from pan, uncover, and set aside.Heat another large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add remaining water (or oil) and shallot. Sauté for 1-2 minutes or until softened and very slightly browned.Add arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Then add dry white wine (or more vegetable broth) and stir gently. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.Using a ladle, add warmed vegetable broth 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling or it will get gummy and cook too fast.Continue to add vegetable broth 1 ladle at a time, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is ""al dente"" - cooked through but not mushy. This whole process should only take 15-20 minutes (may take longer if making a larger batch).Once the rice is cooked through and al dente, remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Also add vegan parmesan cheese and most of the cooked vegetables, reserving a few for serving. Stir to coat (see photo).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste or more vegan parmesan to enhance the cheesiness.To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with remaining vegetables, additional vegan parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of parsley (optional).Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.

110,Easy 1-Pot Black Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Black Beans from Scratch

If you can cover beans with water and turn your stove burner on, you can make these beans. From scratch! I believe in us. Let’s do it!

For some of you, making beans from scratch may seem like old hat. But for those of us less experienced (hand raised) in the art of buying bulk beans to cook yourself, this recipe is good news.
After a little trial and error, research, and testing, we came to realize that if you want black beans that are flavorful, perfectly tender, and not mushy, they actually turn out tastier, less mushy, and deeper in color when you skipsoaking before cooking. This is wonderful because it not only saves time, but there’s also virtually no prep timeand the beans are ready in less than 2 hours!
That’s right! This recipe is super easy, requiring just 6 ingredients and 1 pot to make.


Because the beans aren’t soaked beforehand, it’s a good idea to add a strip of kombu (seaweed) to make the beans easier to digest. And for flavor, add a halved onion and some garlic. Another way to infuse more flavor is to add some vegetable broth to the pot. We prefer a ratio of 3:1 water to vegetable broth.
Next, cook your beans until tender. Then remove the onion and kombu and simmer for another 10-15 minutes to evaporate some of the extra moisture. This is also an excellent time to add your salt and other seasonings. For a smoky, spicy note, we added cumin powder and two chipotles in adobo sauce.

We hope you all LOVE these beans! They’re:
Easy to make
Flavorful
Perfectly tender
NOT mushy
Versatile
Healthy
&amp; Super delicious
These beans are so delicious on their own, but they would also work well with things like burrito bowls, tacos, nachos, veggie burgers and more! We have a fun recipe coming up that puts these beans to good use, so stay tuned! And if you dig this recipe, also be sure to check out our 1-Pot Pinto Beans!

","Add beans, onion, garlic, and kombu to a pot and cover with 3 inches water/vegetable broth. We went with a ratio of about 2/3 water and 1/3 vegetable broth for a little flavor.Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered for 1 hour - 1 hour 45 minutes or until the beans are tender. If during that time the beans are no longer covered in enough liquid to cook, add more water or vegetable broth to just cover.Once tender, remove the onion and kombu and scoop out any excess liquid that’s making the beans soupy (some liquid is good, just scoop out any excess sitting at the top).Season beans to taste at this time. We added salt, cumin powder, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Then increase heat to medium/medium-high (the beans should be bubbling) and cook - stirring occasionally (uncovered) - for 10-15 more minutes. The liquid should evaporate a bit more.Your beans are now ready to enjoy! These make a delicious addition to burrito bowls, burritos, tacos, nachos, taco salads, veggie burgers, and more. You could also add them to chili!Store beans well covered in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days. Will keep in the freezer for 1 month (oftentimes longer)."
111,1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Vanilla Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Vanilla Cake

Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you a perfectly fluffy, tender, sweet vanilla cake that’s vegan and gluten-free! Let’s bake!

This recipe is easy to make, requiring 1 bowl and 10 ingredients.
The base starts with vegan “buttermilk” made by mixing dairy-free milk and vinegar. Then add in applesauce for (oil-free!) moisture and natural sweetness and vanilla extract for that quintessential vanilla flavor. YUM.
For the dry ingredients, after much experimentation, we went with a mixture of almond flour, potato starch, and cornstarch. This combo totally nailed it! So stoked for that fluffy, crumbly texture.



Once your cake is baked, it’s time for frosting!
We included two options: one is coconut whipped cream and the other is classic vegan buttercream frosting. Both are delicious, but we were feeling classic vibes, so we went for the buttercream.

We hope you all LOVE this cake! It’s:
Fluffy
Tender
Perfectly sweet
Vanilla-infused
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect cake for holiday or special occasion celebrations. It’s delicious on its own but also pairs well with coconut whip, vegan buttercream (recipe below), or even chocolate frosting!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease two standard 8-inch round cake pans, one 9x13-inch, or three 6-inch round pans* (with vegan butter or coconut oil) and dust with gluten-free flour. Shake out excess and set aside.In a liquid measuring cup, measure out dairy-free milk and add vinegar. Let set a few minutes. Then add applesauce and vanilla. Whisk/stir to combine.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until well incorporated and no large lumps remain. The batter should be thick but pourable. Add more almond flour if too wet or dairy-free milk if too thick.Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans and bake on a center rack for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the edges and surface appear golden brown.Let cool 15 minutes in the cake pans. To remove from pans, run a dull knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the cakes. Then place a plate or cooling rack on top and quickly invert. Let cool completely (preferably overnight or at least 6 hours on a wire rack) before frosting.Frost with coconut whipped cream and berries for a lighter application (see inspiration here), or frost generously with my 3-ingredient Vegan Buttercream Frosting (see below).Store cake covered at room temperature for 2-3 days or in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Freeze up to 1 month.FROSTING*: Add softened butter to a large mixing bowl and beat for 1 minute. Then add vanilla and mix once more. Gradually add sifted powdered sugar 1 cup at a time and beat until a thick, spreadable frosting is formed. I found about 3 1/2 cups to be the appropriate amount per 1 full cake recipe.If too thick, the frosting will be too hard to spread (add 1/2 tsp almond milk at a time if too thick). If too thin, the frosting will slide off the cake. If too thin, continue adding powdered sugar until you get the right texture.Use immediately or cover and store in the refrigerator up to 5 days. Let come to room temperature before frosting."
112,Smoky BBQ Black Bean Veggie Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger

Say hello to your new favorite veggie burger.
It’s gluten-free, BIG on flavor, infused with smoky BBQ flavor, and perfect on the grill or stovetop. Let’s do this!

This burger is easy to make, requiring simple methods and 10 wholesome ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
It all starts with black beans that are cooked down until dry and cracked, which helps keep the burgers from being mushy. Then comes toasted pecans, which are pulsed into a meal.


Then we add quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, cumin, chili powder, BBQ sauce, and salt. Quinoa adds moisture and also binds the burgers, and the rest is all about flavor: sweet potatoes for sweetness, mushrooms for “meatiness” and texture, and the spices and sauce for smoky BBQ flavor.

For these burgers, it’s best to sear both sides on the stovetop and then finish baking in the oven, where they will dry out and firm up a bit. But they are firm enough for the grill as well!
Once cooked, it’s all about the toppings. We went for vegan buns, lettuce, cabbage, red pepper, pickles, and more BBQ + a little hot sauce. Swoon.

We hope you all LOVE these burgers! They’re:
Smoky
Tender
Hearty
Satisfying
Customizable
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious

","If you haven’t yet, cook quinoa and set aside to cool (see notes for instructions).Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and spread rinsed, dried black beans onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake beans for 6 minutes. Then add pecans to the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes more. The nuts should be fragrant and golden brown (be careful not to burn), and the beans should appear dry and cracked open (this way, they do not become mushy in the burger mix). Set aside to cool. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 C).In the meantime, heat a medium to large cast-iron or metal skillet over medium/medium-low heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and the sweet potato. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes, turning heat down if the potatoes are browning too quickly. Once browned on the underside, flip and cook for 3-4 minutes more or until tender and golden brown. Remove from the pan.To the still-hot pan, add the sliced mushrooms and coconut aminos (optional - sub a little salt otherwise) and cook on medium/medium-high for about 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until they’re browned, fragrant, and cooked down to half their size. Set aside.To a food processor, add beans and pecans and blitz/pulse into a loose meal (some texture is good - you don’t want a powder).Next, add cooked sweet potato, mushrooms, half the quinoa, sea salt, chili powder, cumin, and BBQ sauce and pulse a few times to combine (again, some texture is good here - you're not going for a purée).Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the rest of the quinoa. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cumin for smokiness, chili powder for heat, BBQ sauce for sweetness / depth of flavor, or salt for saltiness.If the mixture appears too wet, add more quinoa. If it looks too dry, add more BBQ sauce (or a little coconut aminos) to moisten.Divide the mixture into four even balls and form into patties with your hands or by lining a 1/2 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap, packing the mixture inside, then lifting the plastic wrap out - mash slightly into more of a disc. Refrigerate burgers for 30 minutes.Once chilled, heat the cast-iron or metal pan from earlier over medium heat. Once hot, add a bit more oil (or water) and the burgers. Cook for 4-5 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for 4-5 minutes on the other side. Then turn off heat, glaze/brush with a bit more BBQ sauce, and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake at 375 F (190C) for 10-15 minutes more. The burgers should appear browned.Serve as is or with toppings. We enjoyed ours on buns with butter lettuce, shredded red pepper, shredded cabbage, pickles, radish, and more BBQ sauce. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
113,Vegan Gluten-Free Pizza Crust | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Gluten-Free Pizza Crust

Friends, it’s here! A vegan, gluten-free pizza crust that’s easy to make with ingredients you probably have on hand right now. Not to mention, it’s perfectly crisp on the edges and firm but tender in the center. Whoop!
Let’s make gluten-free pizza dreams come true!

This recipe requires 10 simple ingredients and comes together in less than 45 minutes from start to finish!
The base flours are comprised of almond flour, potato starch, and arrowroot starch. Potato and arrowroot starch are particularly great for this recipe because they help make a firm and crispy-on-the-edges crust that’s also tender in the center.
No gooey center, no cardboard edges – just pure, airy, delicious goodness.


We also included some flaxseed for binding (and fiber), olive oil for moisture (which you can sub for water if oil-free), oregano and garlic for added flavor, and vinegar and baking soda to help the crust rise a bit.
Having tried a lot of gluten-free crusts (our own, at restaurants, and box mixes), we can confidently say this is the best gluten-free pizza crust we’ve tried and SPOT-ON in flavor and texture. Swoon!

Once your crust is formed, bake for 10 minutes. Then top with desired toppings. We went for tomato sauce, peppers, onions, mushrooms, kalamata olives, oregano, and whipped almond ricotta cheese. But you could go any way you prefer. I could see pesto working well here, as well as my butternut squash sauce!
Just a few more minutes in the oven and it’s officially pizza night!

I hope you all LOVE this crust! It’s:
Easy to make
Crisp on the edges
Tender (but firm) in the middle
Hearty enough to hold LOTS of toppings
&amp; Insanely delicious!
For those of you in the vegan gluten-free camp, this is thee pizza crust for you. We couldn’t believe how fluffy, crispy, and tender it was all at the same time. Plus, not only is it delicious hot out of the oven, it’s also tasty as leftovers the next day – cold or hot!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet, pizza pan, or pizza stone with parchment paper. (You won't be cooking the pizza on the pan but rather on the parchment paper placed directly on the oven rack. So if you don't have a pizza pan, don't worry. You just need something to hold and transfer the pizza in and out of the oven.)To a medium mixing bowl, add the almond flour, potato starch, arrowroot starch, flaxseed meal, baking soda, oregano, garlic powder, and sea salt and whisk thoroughly to combine.In a separate small mixing bowl, combine the vinegar, olive oil, and water. Whisk to combine.Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine until a dough forms (see photo). If it's too crumbly, add water until a moldable dough forms. If too wet, add more almond flour.Transfer the dough to the parchment-lined pan or pizza stone and use your hands (or a floured rolling pin) to flatten and shape into a circle or square (the shape of your pan). It should be about 1/4-inch thick or less. It will puff up a little when baking. If the dough sticks to your hands, lightly oil to prevent sticking.Transfer the crust to the oven by sliding the crust on the parchment paper onto a middle oven rack and bake for 10 minutes.Remove the crust with the parchment paper and set it back on the pan or pizza stone. Top with desired sauce and toppings. We went for puréed tomatoes, onion, peppers, oregano, almond ricotta cheese, and kalamata olives (and added sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil after baking).Bake for another 15-20 minutes or until the toppings are toasted and the crust is very slightly golden brown and firm to the touch.Enjoy hot! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Enjoy cold, or reheat in a 375-degree oven (190 C) until hot.To freeze: I would recommend par-baking the crust (completing the initial bake), then freezing on a baking sheet and storing in the freezer up to 6 weeks. Then, bake as instructed, adding a little extra cooking time if baked from frozen."
114,Smoky Quinoa Black Bean Falafel | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Quinoa Black Bean Falafel

Falafel with black beans! Yeah, we’re kind of crazy about falafel over here and always looking for more ways to enjoy it.
If you’re a falafel lover like we are, you must try this black bean version! It’s baked instead of fried, oil-free, and big on flavor! Let’s do this.

This 10-ingredient recipe is easy to make, and it comes together in 1 hour from start to finish.
It starts with cooked and cooled quinoa and black beans that have been baked. Baking the beans is key, as it dries them out and makes the falafel crispy instead of mushy – a trick I learned from a friend! The quinoa adds moisture and nutrition, and pumpkin seeds add a bit of crunch.
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

The rest of the ingredients are all about flavor: garlic, tomato paste, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, coconut aminos, cumin, coriander, and sea salt.
The result is a smoky, savory falafel dough that’s perfectly seasoned, and it easily forms for baking.

The beauty of this recipe is it’s oil-free and doesn’t require frying! They crisp up perfectly in the oven. Swoon!

I hope you all LOVE these falafel. They’re:
Crispy on the outside
Tender on the inside
Easy to make
Smoky
Savory
Healthy
&amp; SO tasty
These would make the perfect addition to Mediterranean- and Greek-inspired meals, like Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes,The Ultimate Mediterranean Bowl, Greek Goddess Bowls, or even this Roasted Rainbow Vegetable Bowl. They’re also delicious atop a green salad with tahini dressing, hummus, or baba ganoush.

","If you haven’t prepared your quinoa yet, do so now (make sure it’s cooked and cooled completely before use).Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add rinsed, dried black beans to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until beans appear cracked and feel dry to the touch (see beans in food processor photo).

Add formed falafel to a parchment-lined baking sheet.Bake for 15 minutes. Then flip to ensure even baking and bake for 10-15 minutes more or until golden brown and crispy on the edges.These falafel are delicious with hummus, garlic dill sauce, baba ganoush, or tahini sauce. Try garnishing with chili garlic sauce for extra heat. Serve over greens or in pita, or enjoy as is!Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days.

They’re here! The tastiest cauliflower wings on the block using our Korean-Inspired Gochujang Sauce. Let’s do this!

This recipe is easy, requiring 30 minutes and 8 ingredients to make. It’s also nut-free, soy-free, and oil-free optional.
It all starts with a head of cauliflower roasted until just tender. While that’s happening, make your sauce.

This sauce utilizes the Korean Gochujang Sauce we made earlier in the week, mixed with chili garlic sauce for more heat, coconut aminos for saltiness and depth of flavor, and maple syrup for a bit of sweetness to balance the spice. This sauce is finger-lickin’ good.

116,Easy Vegan Gochujang Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Gochujang Sauce (Korean Chili Paste)

In all of the travels we’ve done, South Korea remains one of our favorite countries and Seoul one of our favorite cities.
The people, the culture, the landscape, and the FOOD. Oh my word, the food. It’s all amazing.
We’ve shared an inspired version of easy kimchi on the blog before, but recently, we were craving that quintessential red pepper paste known as gochujang. It’s spicy, savory, and slightly sweet with so much complexity. Traditionally, the sauce is made and fermented to develop the flavors, but there are also ways to make it more simply (and quickly) – which you know we’re all about.
This is my inspired version (not authentic, mind you!) of this curiously complex sauce we’ve grown to love and crave. Let’s get started!

First of all, this recipe is EASY. I mean easy. Anyone can make it. It requires 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, and 1 blender or food processor.
It starts with miso as a base, which provides a quicker route to that fermented flavor. Plus, we like using chickpea miso to avoid the possibility of GMO soy. But if you can only find soy miso, that works, too! The flavors are quite similar.

Next comes Korean chili powder or flakes, which we’ve discovered are quite different than other chili flakes. They’re not as spicy as cayenne and more complex than red pepper flake. If at all possible, order some online (link in recipe) or visit an Asian store in your area to see if you can hunt them down.
For more flavor, we added some fresh garlic, maple syrup for natural sweetness, and coconut aminos in place of soy sauce for saltiness and depth of flavor. Swoon.
What can you use this sauce on? So many things. First of all, it acts as a chili paste in marinades and sauces. Anywhere a recipe calls for chili garlic sauce, you could experiment substituting gochujang for more complex flavor. Bonus: We have a recipe coming soon to show you exactly how we put it to use. Stay tuned!

We hope you LOVE this sauce! It’s:
Spicy
Savory
Bold
Easy to make
Versatile
&amp; Insanely delicious
The cool thing about gochujang is it’s not spice-your-face-off spicy. It’s more of a subtle spice because it’s balanced with other flavors. Plus, you can control the spice level when you make your own! So even if you’re typically averse to spicy food, give this one a try! You might be pleasantly surprised. Use this sauce in our Gochujang Spiced Cauliflower Wings to see what we’re raving about!
If you’re into Korean food, also be sure to check out our Easy Kimchi recipe. And for instant inspiration for where to use this sauce, give it a try in our Marinated Peanut Tempeh or add it to the dipping sauce in these Collard Green Spring Rolls!

Mung beans are kind of magnificent. Ever tried them?
If not, you should! They’re easy to digestandquick-cooking, and theyhelp rid the body of toxins and cleanse the liver! How cool is that?
Ready your mung beans and let’s make soup!

This 10-ingredient, oil-free, grain-free soup starts by soaking and cooking your mung beans. You can soak them overnight, or if you’re in a hurry, you can do it in 1 hour! Once soaked, they cook up in 15-20 minutes. Then your soup is already nearly halfway done.


In a separate pot, you’ll add the basics: onion, carrot, and celery. They’re followed by green beans, kale, zucchini, and a wave of flavor with fire-roasted tomatoes and vegetable broth! We like making our own vegetable broth, but you can easily go for store-bought to save time (our favorite is the brand Imagine).
Once all the ingredients are added, all that’s left to do is let it simmer away to perfection.

We hope you all LOVE this soup! It’s:
Hearty
Healthy
Rich
Satisfying
Loaded with vegetables
Easy to make
&amp; Incredibly nourishing
This is the perfect soup to get you through cold, dark days or when you need a pick-me-up. We reach for this on days when our bodies need a little comfort, and we love making a large batch and freezing it so it’s always on hand. Amplify its nourishing, cleansing effects by topping with raw garlic and fresh parsley.
This soup would pair perfectly with our Cheesy Sunflower Coated Kale Chips,Loaded Kale Salad, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, 5-Minute Detox Salad, or Layered Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Tortilla.

Anyone who has been around Minimalist Baker for a while knows we have a thing for dates. Lots of dates. And we also have a thing for granola.
So it was only a matter of time before the two collided into one delicious, raw, 5-minute granola.

The base for this delicious granola is raw (or sprouted) nuts and LOTS of dates. Mmm, nature’s candy.
Next comes plenty of delicious add-ins like shredded coconut, seeds, and cinnamon. You can also add oats, but to keep it grain-free, sub more coconut or omit.

For serving, the options are endless. We love topping ours with DIY coconut milk and plenty of fresh fruit. But coconut yogurt would also be delicious.
You can also choose to blend in more “flavors” to the raw-nola, like cacao powder or dried fruit such as strawberries or blueberries.

What do cauliflower and pizza have in common? Apparently, a lot.
All the cool kids are making cauliflower pizza crust and I want to be in the club, too. Plus, for those experimenting with lower grain diets, this is a great option! Shall we?

This recipe requires 9 basic ingredients to make. It’s also entirely gluten-, grain-, and oil-free, and it’s vegan!
It starts with cauliflower rice, which is lightly boiled, strained, and squeezed dry. This creates our “dough” base!


Next come herbs and spices, vegan parmesan cheese for flavor, and a flax egg for binding. The dough is then patted into a crust and baked.
While that’s happening, prepare any sauces or toppings of your choice. I went for puréed tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, and onions, as well as a little vegan ricotta cheese!

I hope you all LOVE this crust! It’s:
Savory
Cheesy
Crispy on the edges
Tender in the center

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Use a box grater or the grating blade (not “S” blade) on a food processor to make the cauliflower rice (follow link above for photo tutorial). Set aside.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Then add riced cauliflower. Cook for 5 minutes to soften. Then drain in a fine mesh strainer (make sure it's fine or the cauliflower will seep through the holes). Let cool 5 minutes.While this is happening, this is a good time to prepare pizza sauce or sauté any sturdier vegetables (such as onion and bell pepper) you intend to use as toppings. Otherwise, they require too much time in the oven to brown once the crust is baked. Set aside.Transfer cauliflower rice to a clean dish towel and ring out as much of the excess liquid as possible. This is a very important step, so be sure to ring it out until no more water will come out. Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, prepare the flax egg and let rest 5 minutes. Then add cauliflower rice, sea salt, vegan parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, garlic, and cornstarch.Stir with a mixing spoon or your hands to thoroughly combine. A loose “dough” should form. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more vegan parmesan or nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for saltiness, or herbs/garlic for more intense flavor.Line a baking sheet or pizza stone/pan with parchment paper. Sprinkle with a little cornmeal or gluten-free flour to help prevent the pizza from sticking when slicing.Then use your hands to carefully spread the dough into a circle or square (depending on shape of pan // see photo) and keep the crust slightly less than a 1/2-inch thick with a slightly thicker outer perimeter.Bake crust for 45 minutes. Then remove from oven and carefully flip the crust. Do so by first loosening the crust from the bottom layer of parchment with a spatula and then laying another sheet of parchment paper on top of the crust. Then grab both sheets of parchment and gently flip. Arrange the crust back on the baking pan.Return to the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes more or until the edges appear golden brown and the center feels mostly firm to the touch.Remove from oven and top with desired toppings (cooked or fresh). I recommend going light on the sauce as it can make the crust soggy if too much is applied. Bake for another 10 or so minutes or until toppings are tender. Watch the edges of the crust, which can get brown before the toppings.Enjoy hot with any additional garnishes, such as fresh basil, red pepper flake, or vegan parmesan cheese.Best when fresh. This pizza is best eaten with a fork - I find that it doesn't quite support itself when eaten with hands. Note: You could bake your crust ahead of time and then freeze for later use if desired."

This recipe requires just10 minutes, 1 bowl, and 9 ingredientsto make.
The base is whatever greens you have on hand – such as kale, collards, or beet greens – and fresh herbs. I love the taste of fresh basil and parsley in pesto, so I suggest both. Feel free to customize with whatever greens and herbs you have on hand.

Next comes your nut or seed of choice – I went for brazil nuts and hemp seeds. Then add lemon for acidity, garlic for flavor and kick, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and salt for overall flavor.
To keep this recipe oil-free, sub the olive oil for water. Or mix a little of both, which I prefer doing. That way, you get a bit of that creamy texture without adding too much oil.

A quick blend and bam! Fresh vegan pesto is ready to enjoy on all the carby things.

We hope you LOVE this pesto. It’s:
Fresh
Vibrant
Versatile
Packed with greens
Big on flavor
Super healthy
Cheesy
Garlicky
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect addition to pasta night. I suggest throwing it in things like tofu ricotta cheese or almond ricotta cheese before adding to pasta or pizza, adding a dollop to your marinara for even bolder flavor, or serving with Crispy Gluten-Free Vegan Parmesan, Spaghetti Squash Lasagna, or Sweet Potato Lasagna! It would also be delicious slathered on my Garlic Herb Flatbread. Serious yum.

It’s almost Valentine’s Day, so I couldn’t resist sharing another healthier dessert. You in?

This 7-ingredient recipe starts with blended nuts and is sweetened with dates! Coconut oil adds a little more moisture and “crunch” when chilled, and salt balances everything out. Oh, and don’t forget the cacao powder for that quintessential chocolate flavor. Swoon.

Once you have your “dough,” it’s time to roll it out and cut it into shapes. You can go for big circles, little circles, or squares. I even include a lazy hack if you don’t feel like cutting out actual cookies.
Not to worry – whatever form your “cookies” take, they’re going to be delicious.


The easy filling is simply coconut butter! I love coconut butter in all forms, including straight from the jar. It’s the perfect creamy, naturally sweet center for your cookies.

Once chilled, they’re ready to enjoy! I hope you all LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Rich
Chocolaty
Coconutty
Naturally sweet
Indulgent
Surprisingly healthy
&amp; Super tasty
These would make the perfect healthier dessert to make for Valentine’s Day – or really any day. I highly recommend popping a batch in the freezer and nibbling on them throughout the week when cravings hit.

","First, prepare coconut butter and add vanilla and sweetener to taste (optional). Remove from food processor and set aside.Add nuts to the food processor and pulse until small bits remain. Then add dates, coconut oil, maple syrup (optional), cocoa powder, and salt and mix again until well incorporated (see photo). At the end, you should have a doughy texture that stays together when pressed between your fingers.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cocoa powder for chocolate flavor, dates (or maple syrup) for sweetness, or salt for saltiness.Line a flat surface or large cutting board with parchment or wax paper and place the dough in the center. Form into a 1-inch disc with hands and then top with another piece of parchment or wax paper.Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an even, roughly 1/4-inch-thick rectangle (see photo). Then remove the top layer of wax or parchment paper and use a small circular cookie cutter (like these) to cut out as many cookies as you can - I got roughly 70 (as recipe is written). Just make sure you have an even number. (You could also press half of the dough into a parchment-lined 8x8 baking dish, top with coconut butter, chill, and then top with remaining dough to enjoy them as “Oreo Bars"" instead!)Use a spatula to gently transfer the cookies onto a flat serving platter or plate. Reform any remaining dough and cut out more cookies. Then transfer the serving platter or plate to the freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes or until slightly hardened.Top half of the cookies with roughly 1 tsp coconut butter. Then pop back in the freezer to chill for just a few minutes until the coconut butter is no longer runny. Then remove from freezer and top with the other half of the cookies, pressing down slightly to adhere.Enjoy as is or transfer back to the freezer or refrigerator to chill (they tend to soften when at room temperature more than 30 minutes). Cookies will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer (my preference) up to 1 month."

The day has arrived! My take on healthy (avocado-free) chocolate mousse is here. Let’s do this!

This easy recipe requires just 30 minutes and includes so many delicious, wholesome ingredients.
For my vegetables, I was craving hearty ones, so I went for delicata squash, cauliflower, potatoes, and carrots (not pictured) seasoned with simple spices and roasted until tender.


While that’s happening, make your sauce.
I LOVE this Easy Chimichurri Sauce as a topper for things like Grilled Vegetable SkewersandRoasted Vegetable Salads, as a simple dip with chips or vegetables, and now – on tacos.

127,Feel Good Vegan Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Feel Good Hot Chocolate

Who’s ready for ultra-cozy vibes? (Hand raised!)
This easy hot chocolate recipe requires just 7 ingredients and 15 minutes to make.
While I have a more basic Vegan Hot Cocoa, I wanted to elevate it to include maca powder (where the feel-good vibes come in) and ensure it was naturally sweetened.

It starts with making our own chocolate base with cocoa butter, cacao powder, and a little carob powder, which intensifies the chocolate flavor and adds a little natural sweetness.


Next comes coconut milk, maple syrup for a little added sweetness, cinnamon for warmth, sea salt to bring out the sweetness,and vanilla to enhance the chocolate flavor.
Then comes maca powder, which is an adaptogen rich in minerals like calcium, potassium, iron, and zinc. It also helps boost mood, balance hormones, and support the thyroid. It tastes like something between caramel and honeycomb. In other words, I’m obsessed.

Once everything is mixed and hot, it’s time to serve! Enjoy as is or elevate it even more with homemade coconut whipped cream and more cacao powder.

I hope you all LOVE this hot chocolate! It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Chocolaty
Warming
Naturally sweetened
Surprisingly healthy

This is the perfect hot cocoa for chilly evenings spent inside. You can even make it in advance and heat it up on the stovetop as needed.

128,Vegan Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Tortilla | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Tortilla

When traveling to Portugal last year, we sampled some seriously delicious food, one dish being a Spanish-inspired tortilla.
Traditionally, a Spanish tortilla is a dish that’s somewhere between a gratin and a frittata with plenty of potatoes layered inside – kind of like a potato omelet. I’ve tried many versions at tapas restaurants and was pleasantly surprised that this particular dish relied solely on olive oil instead of eggs and was packed with fresh herbs and garlic for big flavor.
Once we got home, I immediately added it to my list to try and recreate, and it was a major success. Let’s do this!

This 8-ingredient recipe is so easy to make, requires just 1 bowl (and baking dish), and starts with plenty of thinly sliced sweet potato and butternut squash. To do this, I relied on a mandolin, but with a little patience, a sharp knife will work as well.
Next comes a healthy drizzle of olive oil (or other oil of choice, or see notes for oil-free option*), garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and fresh herbs. That’s it! Simply toss then layer evenly into a baking dish and you’re halfway there.


Around 45 minutes to 1 hour in the oven and voila! You have a plant-based dish that’s comforting, big on flavor, and super delicious.

I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Colorful
Savory-sweet
Nutrient-rich
Super flavorful
Versatile
Quick + Easy
&amp; So delicious
This is the perfect dish to make when you’re craving comfort foods this winter. It would make a lovely side dish paired with things like our Sun-dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers, 1-Pot Everyday Lentil Soup, 1-Pot Red Lentil Chili, or Saucy Moroccan-Spiced Lentils!
Or to make it more of a meal, serve it over mixed greens and top with my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese or Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas! And drizzle with some tahini dressing – yum!

129,Sugar-Free Carob Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sugar-Free Coconut Carob Bars

Recently, I came upon a new-to-me ingredient: carob powder! Have you tried it? It’s like cacao powder, but not. And while it tastes like chocolate, it also has hints of coffee and is naturally sweet (unlike cacao).
Once I mixed it with some coconut butterand took one bite (hello, delicious), I knew a coconut carob bar had to happen. Plus, they fit in nicely with the sugar-free theme going on this month. Let’s do this!

This 7-ingredient recipe is easy to make. It all comes together in a food processor.
The base is coconut butter, which is easy to make at home. It provides a creamy, coconutty, naturally sweet base for these insanely rich bars.
Next comes coconut oil, sea salt, vanilla, and maca powder, though that’s optional. Maca not only adds a honeycomb, caramel-like flavor but also provides health benefits like balancing your hormones and supporting thyroid function. And it boasts minerals like zinc, phosphorous, iron, calcium, and potassium.
The star of the show, though, is carob powder, which supports healthy digestion and has calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, copper, and zinc. It’s also a healthy alternative to chocolate for those who can’t enjoy it.

Once the mixture is blended, simply pour into molds of choice and chill. It’s that easy!

I hope you all LOVE these bars! They’re:
Naturally (and perfectly) sweet
Coconutty
Chocolaty
Rich
Satisfying
Healthy
&amp; Super delicious
These would make the perfect snack or treat to have on hand throughout the week. It’s like a chocolate bar but somehow sweet without adding any sweetener, which has made it my new favorite dessert!

","Add all ingredients to a food processor and blend to combine until completely smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more carob powder for ""chocolate"" flavor or sweetness, maca powder for caramel flavor, salt for saltiness, vanilla for vanilla flavor, or coconut butter for creaminess. If it appears too liquidy, add an additional 1 Tbsp (9 g // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) coconut flour. You're looking for a pourable liquid, but not too watery.Pour into cupcake liner molds, a lined loaf pan, or silicone chocolate molds like these or these, and let cool until firm. Depending on the temperature of your home, they may solidify at room temperature. If not, carefully transfer to the refrigerator until firm. Then remove from molds and enjoy.

Let thaw slightly before enjoying for best texture."
130,Curried Quinoa Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curried Quinoa Salad

This salad combines all of my very favorite things at the moment: quinoa, curry paste, tahini, and all the vegetables.
It’s tangy, it’s vibrant, it’s fresh, and it’s the perfect side dish or salad main to lift you out of any winter eating rut. Let’s do this!

The base for this 10-ingredient recipe is quinoa cooked with curry powder until tender. Then come fresh vegetables, herbs, and an utterly delicious tahini green curry paste dressing I’ve been putting on everything lately.
The result is a hearty, savory dish that is easy, delicious, and quite versatile (adapt to what season you’re experiencing).

For my salad “toppings,” I went with radish, bell pepper, green onion, and cilantro. Pomegranate arils are another colorful addition that adds another wave of color and texture. Swoon.

Move over, hummus. There’s a new dip in town.
Have you ever tried muhammara? It’s a spicy pepper dip that originated from Aleppo, Syria, with one of the key ingredients being Aleppo chili flakes! Think of this dip as a mix of savory, sweet, and smoky with a little spice. Let’s do this!

This recipe is easy, requiring just 10 ingredients (I include substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients below) and simple methods. And it all starts with roasted red bell peppers for a smoky, sweet base.

Next comes lemon for acidity, walnuts for bite, cumin for smokiness, Aleppo chili flakes for heat, pomegranate molasses for sweetness and depth of flavor, bread crumbs for texture, olive oil for body, and salt for overall flavor.
Friends, the result is dreamy. Ready your pita – we’re going in.

I hope you all LOVE this dip! It’s:

While the vegetables roast away, simply sauté the garlic and shallot (add a pepper for extra heat!) and add in the curry paste and coconut milk plus a little turmeric (nature’s gold dust) and coconut aminos. Then you’re in curry heaven.

133,1-Pot Vegan Lentil Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Everyday Lentil Soup

Everyone needs a good lentil soup in their back pocket for days when you don’t really feel like cooking but want something nourishing on the table fast.
This is my go-to version, which happens to require just 10 (basic) ingredients, 1 pot, and a little more than 30 minutes to prepare. Shall we?

The base for this lovely, everyday soup starts with hearty vegetables for plenty of plant-based fiber and flavor.
I went with carrots, celery, kale, and potatoes. Garlic and onion are optional (they seem to aggravate some people’s digestion, so I’ve left them as optional in this recipe). And in my opinion, the real flavor magic happens when you add your own Homemade Vegetable Stock (so rich, flavorful, and such a good use of vegetable scraps leftover from the week).

Of course, you can’t have lentil soup without the lentils! I went with green lentils, but you could also sub other varieties if you’d like (just adjust cooking time accordingly). And if you’re not a lentil fan, you could always sub cooked beans, such as white beans or chickpeas – both would be lovely here.

I hope you all LOVE this easy, everyday lentil soup. It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Fiber- + Protein-rich
Super healthy
Easy
Versatile
&amp; Seriously delicious
This is my go-to meal when the weather gets cold and I want a no-fuss meal on the table fast. It reheats beautifully, which makes it perfect for making ahead and packing for lunches throughout the week. And it pairs beautifully with a rustic bread – such as sourdough toast or my Fluffy Vegan Spelt Rolls – or a hearty kale salad, like my Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. Bonus? One serving has 21 grams of proteinand 20 grams of fiber!

I love garnishing mine with a little fresh parsley for a pop of color and freshness (optional).Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop and add more vegetable broth to rehydrate as needed."
134,Vegan Gluten-Free Buckwheat Crepes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Buckwheat Crepes

If you’re looking for a new breakfast recipe for lazy weekend mornings, I have just the thing for you.
A crepe is like having a mini burrito for breakfast, and quite frankly, who wouldn’t want that? Plus, the flavor options and filling possibilities are endless. Let’s do this!

This crepe recipe was inspired by a new-to-me Youtube channel,Cam and Nina, which focuses on making vegan food easy and delicious – something we’re all about. So when I saw they had a crepe recipe that was both vegan and gluten free – a recipe I’ve been trying to tackle for years now – I had to give it a try. And I must say, with a couple of small tweaks, I’ve made it my own and am totally in love with the result.
One of the best things about this 30-minute, 5-ingredient recipe is it’s SO versatile. It can be made oil-free, sugar-free, sweet, and savory, and the filling/topping options are endless. It’s just a good, hearty, basic crepe that you can make your own depending on what you’re craving.

This recipe is made with a simple mix of (untoasted*) buckwheat flour (a hearty, gluten-free grain), dairy-free milk, a little oil, salt, and sweetener / seasonings of choice. That’s it!
Once it’s mixed, all that’s left to do is swirl onto a hot pan and cook until crispy on the edges and fluffy on the inside.


﻿
I hope you all LOVE these crepes! They’re:
Tender
Hearty
Satisfying
Wholesome
Versatile
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
These would make a lovely lazy weekend breakfast, filled with savory things like tofu scrambleandroasted veggies with my vegan hollandaise (recipe in our cookbook!) or sweet things like Cinnamon Baked Apples, nuts, and maple syrup.

*7/20/18 Recipe updated to include new dairy-free milk recommendation, plus tips on how to prohibit the crepes from sticking to the pan.
","To a blender or mixing bowl, add buckwheat flour (see notes), flaxseed meal, light (canned) coconut milk, salt, avocado oil, cinnamon (omit for savory), and sweetener of choice (omit for savory or unsweetened).Pulse in blender or whisk in mixing bowl to combine. The batter should be pourable but not watery. If too thin, add a bit more buckwheat flour. If too thick, thin with more dairy-free milk.Heat a cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. (Non-stick is typically best for crepes, but I used a seasoned cast-iron skillet and it worked well, too). Once hot, add a little oil and spread into an even layer. Let the oil heat until hot - when you flick a little water onto the pan, it should crackle and evaporate almost immediately.Add ~1/4 cup (60 ml) batter. Let cook until the top appears bubbly and the edges are dry (similar to pancakes). Then carefully flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more on the other side. Turn heat down if cooking too quickly.Repeat until all crepes are prepared. We didn't find we needed to add any more oil after the first crepe. Keep warm between layers of parchment paper or on a plate under a towel. Serve as is with a little vegan butter, nut butter, maple syrup, compote, or other fillings or choice! My preferred is vegan butter, berries, maple syrup, and banana. But these would also be delicious with coconut whipped cream, Cinnamon Baked Apples, fresh fruit (e.g. berries or bananas), or granola.Best when fresh, but you can store leftovers sealed in the refrigerator up to 3 days. To freeze, layer between pieces of parchment paper (to prevent sticking) and freeze. Then store in a freezer-safe container up to 1 month. To reheat, warm in a 350-degree F (176C) oven or microwave until hot."
135,Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas

Friends, the day has arrived! The day that actually crispy (not fried) chickpeas can happen in your kitchen! Like, it’s a real thing!
Let’s do this!

The magic of this 4-ingredient, easy recipe starts with cooked chickpeas. I went for canned because: easy. But I also suspect you could use home-cooked if that’s your thing.
The #1 crispytipis to rinse, drain really well, then dry really well. Like, really, really well. The less moist (ew, sorry) the chickpeas are, the crispier they will become!

Once your chickpeas are dry, this brings me to tip #2: Peel the skins!
Peeling the skins is onerous and annoying. Yes, I know. But in my experience, it does help them crisp up a bit more in the oven. And when it comes to crisping chickpeas, every little bit helps!

Now, it’s time for oil (if oil-free, you’ll omit this step) and salt. This brings me to tip #3: You’ll want to wait to add any other seasonings until after they’re done baking. I’ve found that too much seasoning can interrupt the crisping process, almost by trapping in the moisture and not letting the chickpeas “breathe.”
Next step is tip #4: Bake at 350 F (176 C) for 45-50 minutes. In experimenting, I found that, at too high a temperature, the chickpeas burn quickly while being tender in the center. And if too low, no crisping seems to happen for a very long time. So 350 degrees is the sweet spot.
Tip #5 is to let the chickpeas cool once out of the oven, and tip #6 is to store without a sealed lid. Doing so lets the chickpeas breathe and stay crispy longer than just 1 day.

That’s it, friends! You now have crispy chickpeas. They’re:
Crispy
Flavorful
Simple to make
Versatile
Healthy
Snacky
&amp; SUPER delicious
I love these chickpeas as a straight-up snack at home or on the go. They’re also great atop things like salads, soups, and Buddha bowls!
Try these chickpeas with my Garlicky Kale Salad, Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Butternut Squash Pizza, Greek Goddess Bowl, or Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl! They’d also be equally tasty on my Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes. What I’m saying is: They’re delicious on pretty much everything!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and set out a bare baking sheet (or more, as needed).Drain chickpeas well. If using oil, rinse well with water and thoroughly drain. If omitting oil, simply drain well and skip rinsing with water.Once drained well, spread the chickpeas out on a clean, absorbent towel and use your hands to gently roll and dry the chickpeas. Some of the skins should start coming off. You can opt to peel all of the chickpeas - which can help for extra crispiness! - or simply remove the skins that come off. Either way, the chickpeas will crisp up. I just found that peeling them does yield slightly crispier chickpeas.Transfer the chickpeas to a mixing bowl and top with oil (or omit) and salt. Mix well to combine. DO NOT add the other seasoning at this point - it can interrupt the crisping process, so wait to add until after baking.Bake for a total of 45-50 minutes or until golden brown and dry/crispy to the touch. I like turning my pan around and shaking the chickpeas around at the halfway point for even cooking.Remove from oven and toss with seasonings (if desired) while still warm. Then let cool 5-10 minutes - they will continue crisping as they cool.Serve as is or atop bowls or salads! To store, place in a Tupperware container or jar and DO NOT tightly cover. Instead, crack lid so they can ""breathe"" a bit. I found that this helped them stay crispy longer. These are best in the first day, but they will last for 4-5 days at room temperature. Alternatively, seal well and freeze up to 1 month."
136,Sunflower-Coated Cheesy Kale Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sunflower-Coated Cheesy Kale Chips

If you’re into kale chips, this is definitely a variation you need to try!
It requires simple methodsand 7 wholesome ingredients, and it yields BIG flavor. Let’s do this!

The base for this recipe is a cheesy sauce made with sunflower seeds, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and a few extra seasonings. The sunflower seeds are soaked then blended so this creamy goodness can coat the kale and help it crisp up (into chips – duh).

The key to the coating process is to have the kale thoroughly coated but avoid areas of serious clump!
If you have any kale with a lot of the seasoning, it can have a tendency to remain a little tender after baking (which is not what we want). So coat, spread, and remove any excess. Then bake!


I hope you all LOVE these chips! They’re:
Crispy
Cheesy
Seriously flavorful
Super healthy
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect snack to have on a lazy day at home or if you’ve made a dip and want something healthy to go along with it (think 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese,Easy Red Salsa, Garlicky Guac, or Lentil Dip).
If you’re into kale, you’ll also like this version of Cheesy Kale Chipsor this Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. And don’t forget my Kale Chip Nachos, Loaded Kale Salad,Hide Your Kale Smoothie, and Easy Asian Kale Salad!

","Soak sunflower seeds and then drain thoroughly. Then add to a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, ground turmeric, sea salt, cayenne pepper, and water. Blend on high until creamy and smooth. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more spices for overall flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, or lemon juice for acidity.Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (107 C). Use convection bake if you have it to speed cooking time and help chips crisp up even more. Place parchment paper on two large baking sheets to prevent sticking. Set aside.Rinse and thoroughly dry kale. Then tear into small pieces and discard any large stems (they won't crisp well). Add to a large mixing bowl and add the sunflower mixture. Toss thoroughly to combine, using hands to distribute the seasonings evenly. If possible, try and massage well enough to avoid large clumps of sauce on the kale or they may have trouble crisping up.Spread the kale over the parchment-lined baking sheets, ensuring that the kale touches as little as possible to help crisp while baking. Depending on size of baking sheets, you may need to do this in several batches. The important thing is to make sure the kale isn’t overlapping.Bake for 20 minutes. Then turn the pans around and lightly toss/stir kale to ensure even baking. Bake for 10-20 minutes more or until kale is crispy and very slightly golden brown. If some of the chips are still wet with the seasoning, you can leave the pans in the oven a little longer at 200 F (93 C) to further dry / crisp up.Remove from oven and let cool completely - chips will crisp up even more once out of the oven. Enjoy immediately! Best when fresh, although you can loosely cover leftovers (try not to seal) at room temperature for 2-3 days."
137,Moroccan Lentil Stuffed Eggplant | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Moroccan Lentil-Stuffed Eggplant

Did you make those Saucy Moroccan-Spiced Lentils yet? I hope so, because I have the perfect application for them. Let’s do this!

This recipe requires 9 ingredients and comes together in about an hour.
The lentils are added to crushed tomatoes and seasoned a bit more. Then they’re simmered to perfection. In the meantime, slice eggplants (I include two methods in this recipe!) and prepare for stuffing.


Once your eggplants have browned , it’s time to top them with your lentils. I also seasoned mine with a bit of vegan parmesan cheese and gluten-free bread crumbs for extra crunch, which I highly recommend!

For those stuffing the eggplant, simply bake until bubbling and golden brown and you have one saucy, satisfying dinner on your hands.

And for those slicing and rolling, your final product will look more like this!

In my opinion, the roll-ups are a prettier presentation that requires less cooking time. But the stuffed eggplants look like a seriously hearty entrée when plated. You can’t lose either way!
I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Hearty
Saucy
Smoky
Satisfying
Healthy
Versatile
&amp; Delicious!
This is the perfect hearty entrée or side dish that would be especially perfect for hosting. It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with my Garlicky Kale Salad and Crispy Chickpeas, Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables, 1-Pot Vegan Minestrone, and Sweet Potato and Avocado Green Salad. Also, my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese or Whipped Almond Ricotta would make the perfect flavor addition!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and get out a 9x13-inch (or similar size) baking dish.To a large saucepan or rimmed skillet, add Moroccan-Spiced Lentils, crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, and paprika. Heat over medium heat until bubbling. Then reduce heat to simmer and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt and pepper for overall flavor or paprika for smokiness.See notes if thinly slicing and rolling the eggplant. Otherwise, use a knife to cut an angled divot out of the center of your eggplants. Then use a spoon to scrape out a hollow center. Leave enough eggplant flesh so it's sturdy enough to hold the lentils (see photo). (Save leftover eggplant to make things like Eggplant Curry, Persian Eggplant Dip, or Baba Ganoush.)Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and the eggplant cut-side down and cover - you may have to do this in two (or more if increasing batch size) batches depending on the size of your pan. Cook on one side for 4-5 minutes or until slightly charred. Then flip the eggplant over on the other side, cover, and cook for 4-5 minutes more. You're looking for the eggplant to be softened and browned on the outside.Once the eggplant is cooked, place cut-side up in your baking dish and top with lentils. There should be plenty to fill the eggplant and some overflow, which can be spooned down into the dish. Top with vegan parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs.Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes or until the eggplant is soft and browned and the lentils are bubbling. The bread crumbs should be browned.Serve as is or over rice or cauliflower rice (optional). Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro (optional) for color and flavor.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
138,Loaded Kale Salad with Tahini Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Loaded Kale Salad

Happy New Year, friends!
How is 2018 treating you so far? Hopefully well.
To jump into the new year on the right foot, the entire month of January will include only sugar-free or no-sugar-added recipes!
I’m starting with my go-to Loaded Kale Salad. It’s easy to whip up for lunch or dinner, and elements of it can be prepped ahead of timeso you can make it as an easy side or main throughout the week. Shall we?

This recipe starts with a base of hearty vegetables and requires just 10 ingredients total.
It’s also oil-free, naturally sweetened, nut-free, and, of course, plant-based and gluten-free.
I like to start by cooking my quinoa and roasting my vegetables, which takes the most time. If you know you’d like to have this salad several times during the week, double the amount of quinoa and roasted vegetables and reheat/use as needed to save time.

While the vegetables and quinoa are cooking, move onto the dressing, which consists of 3 easy ingredients: tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup. A sprinkle of salt is optional, but it adds a bit more flavor. And if you aren’t into tart-sweet dressings, I’ve included a savory version in the notes.

All that’s left is serving! Add any additional seasonal vegetables or toppings you desire. I opted for broccoli sprouts and hemp seeds for added nutrients, protein, and healthy fat.

I hope you all LOVE this Loaded Kale Salad! It’s:
Hearty
Super healthy
Colorful
Nutrient-dense
Satisfying
Versatile
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect weekday meal either for lunch or dinner. It also packs well, which makes it great for road trips (and even plane trips!).

In true Minimalist Baker fashion, let’s pour a drink and cheers to a new year.

This 6-ingredient cocktail is my new favorite thing. It combines all of my favorite flavors: citrus, ginger, orange, and bourbon. It’s like they belong together. Who are we to keep them apart?
Orange peel is muddled with fresh ginger juice, lemon juice, maple syrup, and bitters. Then comes ice and bourbon and a vigorous shake or stir before serving over ice. That’s it! And your perfect New Year’s Eve (or everyday) cocktail is ready.


For garnish, I went with fresh mint, lemon wedges, and a few cranberries for a festive touch, but it’s entirely up to you! I could also see pomegranate or candied ginger being delicious additions. Cheers!

Gingery
Citrusy
Naturally sweet

Lentils know no bounds. They’re the perfect high-protein, high-fiber food that take on just about any flavor you add to them. And speaking of flavor, I love spices. I felt inspired by the flavors of Morocco by this dish. Think paprika, turmeric, coriander, and pepper.
If you’re into saucy, smoky lentils, this recipe is for you. Let me show you how!

This 30-minute recipe starts with cooking your lentils. And while that happens, it’s time for the sauce.
To create a super flavorful and quick sauce, I blended onion, garlic, and red bell pepper with spices like turmeric, paprika, and cayenne. Tomato paste adds depth of flavor, and apple cider vinegar adds a little acidity. It’s the perfect mix of bold flavors I was looking for.

All that’s left to do is add the sauce to the lentils with some fresh herbs – like parsley and cilantro – and stir to combine. Yeah, it’s that easy!

Oh, and I was also thinking about the flavors. Don’t you worry. This herbed green cranberry salad is a total flavor bomb! Let’s do this!

This 30-minute recipe all starts with a sumptuous cranberry compote we’re going to turn into a creamy vinaigrette. Cranberry compote is so simple to make. Simply boil with a sweetener, some zest, and citrus juice for 10 minutes and voila! You’re ready to go.

Next, simply blend or whisk with red wine vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, salt, and pepper and you’ve got a creamy, tangy, naturally sweet dressing on your hands.

Another star ingredient? These 1-pan roasted candied pecans. I know!
Simply toast raw pecans on the stovetop.Then drizzle on some maple syrup, coconut oil, coconut sugar, and some spices and you’ve got 8-minute candied pecans. It’s that easy.

All that’s left to do is plate and serve. I went with mixed kale and romaine for my base. Then I dressed it with crunchy cucumbers, fresh mint and parsley, and the candied pecans.
For more “oomph,” I also added some of my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese (total swoon fest) and some baked crispy chickpeas. These toppings are optional, but they add more protein and fiber to the mix, as well as flavor and texture.

I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s:

142,Gluten-Free Cinnamon Rolls (Vegan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Cinnamon Rolls

Friends, behold: The Gluten-Free Vegan Cinnamon Roll.
They’re like the unicorn of the gluten-free, vegan baking world. Many have attempted, few have succeeded. Yet I knew they existed and were possible if I just believed (and tried and tried again and again).
After 11 – read ELEVEN – attempts, I believe I’ve nailed it. Let’s bake!

These cinnamon rolls are surprisingly easy to make. They require just 10 ingredients you likely have on hand right now (!!) and come together using simple methods.
If you’ve ever been intimidated by yeast in baking, don’t be! I include my favorite yeast below, and as long as you don’t overheat your almond milk, you’re golden. It should activate right away and help your rolls rise to the heavens.

The cinnamon roll dough is kept light and fluffy with a blend of gluten-free flour and almond flour.
Vegan butter adds flakiness to the exterior and moisture to the interior, creating that perfect tender-on-the-inside, flaky-on-the-outside cinnamon roll. YUM.

The one part that looks intimidating (but totally isn’t) is the rolling-out process.
Simply line a cutting board with plastic wrap, dust with gluten-free flour, and plop your dough down. Then top with more plastic wrap and roll into a thin rectangle. And voila! You have a perfect cylinder for cutting your rolls. See? I told you we could do it.


Next is a short rise on a warm oven so the dough can expand. Once the rolls are almost touching, it’s time for a short bake in the oven.
We’re so close, friends. So close!

Whoop! Behold: perfectly crisp and tender cinnamon rolls.
At this point, you can glaze or not glaze. But…glaze. I include two frosting options below so there’s something for everyone.

I hope you all LOVE these rolls! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Flaky on the outside
Cinnamon-spiked
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Seriously delicious!
These would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast or special occasion dessert (like the holidays!).

*NOTE: Recipe updatedJuly 10, 2018 for improved texture and taste.
","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and use vegan butter oil to lightly coat a standard pie plate or round baking dish. Set aside.Heat dairy-free milk in the microwave or on the stovetop to the temperature of warm bath water - approximately 110 degrees F (43 C). Be careful not to exceed that temperature or it can kill the yeast.To the dairy-free milk, add the vegan butter and sugar and stir melt. Then add yeast and stir once more. Set aside (uncovered) to proof for 10 minutes, or until it appears puffy on the surface (this indicates the yeast is activating. If it hasn’t activated at this point, either your yeast was expired or the liquid was too hot or not hot enough).Meanwhile in a medium mixing bowl whisk together gluten free flour blend (including xanthan gum), almond flour, cane sugar, baking powder, and sea salt. Then add cold vegan butter and use a fork or pastry cutter to mix or “cut” into the dry mixture. It should resemble the texture of wet sand (see photo).To the dry ingredients, add the almond milk-yeast mixture a little at a time and stir. A dough that resembles moist (not crumbly) cookie dough should form (see photo). Add more of the wet mixture as needed. If it gets too wet and tacky (you should be able to form it into a ball when rolled), add more almond flour or GF flour blend. Set aside.Get a large cutting board and wrap with plastic wrap (tuck the wrap down around the edges so it stays in place). Then dust the surface of the plastic wrap generously with gluten-free flour.Add the dough in the center of the board and sprinkle with more gluten-free flour. Then top with another sheet of plastic wrap and tuck down around the edges of the cutting board (so it stays in place). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large, thin rectangle. The dough should be about 1/8th-inch thick.Carefully remove the top layer of plastic wrap and brush on the vegan butter. Then sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon and spread gently with fingers to evenly distribute. Then, untuck the bottom layer of plastic wrap from the cutting board and use it to tightly roll the dough lengthwise into a cylinder (see photo).Use a serrated knife or floss (my preferred method) to cut into even rolls (as the recipe is written, 7-8). Then carefully transfer to the prepared pie dish or cake pan (they can be fragile to transfer). Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and set on top of the warm oven and let rise for about 30 minutes, or until the rolls have risen slightly and are touching (or close to touching) - they won’t get as voluminous as gluten-containing rolls, but they will puff up a bit!Remove towel and plastic wrap and place rolls on the center rack of your oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until tops are golden brown and the rolls have risen/expanded quite a bit. While the rolls bake, you can prepare a frosting / glaze (optional).Let the rolls cool at least 20 minutes before frosting (optional), then enjoy! Store leftover cinnamon rolls covered at room temperature up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. See notes for make-ahead cinnamon rolls to store in the freezer (unbaked)."
143,Vegan Dark Chocolate Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Dark Chocolate Bars

Friends! You probably know this by now, but I have a thing for chocolate (e.g.Chocolate Pancakes, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Brownies, Chocolate Energy Bites, Chocolate Cake). The obsession is real.
I’ve even shared how to make vegan chocolate before! But I couldn’t help but share my most recent obsession: my go-to vegan dark chocolate recipe when cravings hit. Let’s make chocolate!

This 5-ingredient recipe is very similar to the coating for my Tahini-Stuffed Dates (a.k.a. Tahini Bombs!).
The base starts with a mixture of a little coconut oil and mostly cocoa butter, which adds an intensely delicious chocolate aroma and flavor and a lovely creaminess to the chocolate. I’ve found that, if you only use coconut oil, the chocolate is almost too melty to hold on to and way too hard right out of the freezer. This combination makes the perfect base!

﻿
The next step is cocoa powder or cacao powder. I’ve found that mixing the two gives the perfect chocolaty flavor that isn’t too overwhelming. Plus, cacao powder can be quite expensive, so I like adding only 1/2 cup instead of 1 full cup (#savings).
To keep things naturally sweetened, I go for just a little maple syrup. You could also sub stevia to keep these entirely sugar-free or agave if you don’t have maple syrup. But, for best flavor and subtle sweetness, maple syrup is my go-to.
Two optional flavor add-ins are sea salt and vanilla extract, which contrast the sweetness well and complement the flavor of the chocolate beautifully. Not essential, but they certainly take these to next-level dreaminess.

Once your chocolate is mixed, I like pouring mine into molds and topping with cacao nibs, which add that beautiful texture and a bit of crunch to the bar. Where my fellow texture freaks at? Creamy + crunchy = dream factor 1,000.
And that’s it! Freeze until you’re ready to eat and enjoy.

I hope you all LOVE my go-to vegan dark chocolate bars. They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Flavorful
Chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
Customizable
&amp; Seriously delicious
These are the perfect naturally sweetened, healthier dessert to have on hand for treats throughout the week. I like keeping mine in the refrigerator and breaking off a bite after dinner. The sugar content is so low (only 2g sugar per half-bar serving!) that I don’t feel bad at all for indulging daily.

","Add 2 inches of water to a medium saucepan and bring to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat. Then reduce heat to medium and set a medium glass or ceramic mixing bowl on top, making sure it's not touching the water (this creates a ""double boiler"").To the mixing bowl, add finely chopped cocoa butter and coconut oil and let melt, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or whisk - about 2-3 minutes.Once melted, carefully remove bowl from heat (turn off stovetop), add the cacao or cocoa powder to a fine mesh strainer (like this one), and sift it over the melted cocoa butter (otherwise, it can be clumpy). Use a whisk or wooden spoon to mix until fluid and thoroughly combined.Add maple syrup and stir once more. At this time, you can also add the (optional) salt and vanilla .Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added about 2 Tbsp maple syrup total (as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), but it’s completely up to you and how sweet you prefer your chocolate. Add more vanilla to enhance the chocolate flavor and add depth of flavor, salt for saltiness, or more cacao/cocoa powder for intense chocolate flavor.Pour your chocolate into molds of choice. I like these bar molds, but you can also just pour into paper cupcake liners, or an 8x8-inch baking dish lined with parchment paper. At this point, sprinkle on your cacao nibs. I also sprinkle on a pinch more salt.Carefully transfer to freezer (I like setting mine on a baking sheet or plate so it lies flat and is stable while chilling). Remove from molds once the chocolate is set - about 1 hour.Store covered in the refrigerator for several weeks or in the freezer for even longer. Let come to almost room temperature before enjoying, as it's creamier and the flavors are more pronounced when it's warmed up a bit."
144,Easy Vegan Caramel Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Caramel Sauce

Friends, what we have here is some seriously creamy, dreamy vegan caramel sauce, and I cannot WAIT to share this recipe with you. Let’s do it!

The base for this 5-ingredient caramel is coconut cream, dates, and arrowroot starch, which are blended until creamy and smooth. This makes up the liquid ingredients, which are added to a bit of coconut sugar and cooked until glossy and just bubbly.
The whole process for this naturally sweetened sauce takes just 10-15 minutes! And bam – it’s ready to go.
While it’s perfect right out of the saucepan, it also stores well in the refrigerator, where it takes on a slightly lighter color and is super tasty by the spoonful as a midday treat. (What? Who said that? Me. It was me. I did that. Several times.)

You can see in the photo below that the caramel on the right is fresh from the saucepan, and the caramel on the left has been refrigerated for 24 hours and has taken on a much lighter color. Mmmm, dreamy.


I hope you all LOVE this caramel! It’s:
Creamy
Smooth
Caramel-y
Perfectly (and naturally) sweet!
Slightly salty
So easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This is the perfect caramel sauce for things like Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream, Vegan Apple Pie, Ice Cream Snickers Bars, Caramel Frappuccinos, Cinnamon Baked Apples, Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tarts (!), Deep Dish Apple Crumble Pies, Vegan Samoas, and Apple Pie Sundaes! The list could go on forever and ever.

","To a small blender or food processor (I used the smallest container of a Magic Bullet), add the arrowroot starch, dates, and 3/4 cup (180 ml // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size // it will be about 2/3 the total amount) coconut cream or milk. Blend on high until creamy and smooth. If it has trouble blending, add more coconut milk or cream. If you don't have a blender small enough, simply whisk coconut cream and arrowroot starch together, and finely chop/smash your dates and add them in.To a small saucepan, add coconut sugar. Then pour the coconut milk mixture on top. Heat over medium heat and whisk or stir as it comes to a low simmer. As soon as the caramel is glossy and deep golden brown, it's ready. It shouldn't boil and only needs to cook for 2-4 minutes total.Remove saucepan from heat and add remaining 1/2 cup (120 ml // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) coconut milk or cream as well as salt and (optional) vanilla. Stir to combine.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, vanilla for vanilla flavor, or coconut cream for a lighter color and more coconut flavor.Let cool slightly. Then transfer to clean glass jar and let cool completely before covering (see photo). Store in refrigerator for 1-2 weeks. Reheat in microwave or place jar in a saucepan with 2-3 inches simmering water until warmed through. However, sauce is also pourable and delicious directly from the refrigerator!Note: If for some reason your caramel sauce isn't smooth and creamy and has little date pieces, once it's cooled completely, you can add it to a high-speed blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth. I didn't find this necessary, but it will depend on the equipment you use."
145,Vegan Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan

When the weather gets colder outside, I start craving all the warm, comforting, cozy meals. Think chili, shepherd’s pie, and hearty dishes like eggplant parmesan (which is on weekly rotation in our household)!
This is new my go-to crispy, gluten-free version that’s so easy to make, customizable, and insanely delicious. Let me show you how!

This 10-ingredient recipe starts with thinly sliced eggplant.
My original version required salting and rinsing the eggplant to remove bitterness, but having tested it both ways now, I’ve found that it’s an unnecessary step and one that adds too much moisture to the eggplant. Especially when working with gluten-free flours and bread crumbs, extra moisture decreases the level of crispiness you can get on the eggplant. Plus, not salting saves time, meaning this dish is ready in about 45 minutes start to finish.


The breading process is simple: Dust in gluten-free flour, dip in almond milk and cornstarch, and finish up with a mixture of gluten-free panko bread crumbs, vegan parmesan cheese, and cornmeal. I’ve found this mixture to create the perfect breading for ultra-crispy eggplant rounds.
Next, sauté over medium heat until light golden brown, and finish up in the oven until crispy. That’s it!

I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Crispy
“Cheesy”
Flavorful
Comforting
Satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving something plant-based but super hearty. It even satisfies picky eaters with its crispy texture, hearty dipping sauce options, and the fact that it pairs so well with pasta (hello, carbs, I’m Dana and I love you).
This dish is tasty on its own, but it would also pair well with my Vegan Niçoise Salad, Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables, 1-Pot Vegan Minestrone, and Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodles! And for extra sauces, check out my Easy Vegan Pesto, 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, and Whipped Almond Ricotta,

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Also, prepare your dipping stations by mixing together almond milk and cornstarch in one bowl; gluten-free flour, cornstarch, and sea salt in another bowl; and gluten-free panko bread crumbs, cornmeal, vegan parmesan cheese, oregano, and sea salt in another bowl (see photo).If serving with pasta and sauces, prepare at this time (optional). Once pasta is done cooking, drain and cover with a towel to keep warm. Set aside.Next, dip eggplant slices in flour mixture, then almond milk mixture, and then breadcrumb mixture and arrange dipped rounds on a clean plate.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil (30 ml // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Let the oil heat for 1 minute. Then add 4-5 eggplant rounds at a time and brown for ~2-3 minutes on each side or until light golden brown. Then add to the prepared baking sheet, and add baking sheet to the oven so the eggplant can start baking.Continue browning eggplant in batches until all rounds are browned and in the oven, adding more oil to the cooking pan as needed and turn down heat if eggplant rounds are browning too quickly.Bake eggplant for 10-15 minutes or until crispy and golden brown, flipping once around the halfway mark to ensure even baking. Then serve as is or with desired sides and sauces.I love serving my eggplant parmesan with marinara sauce for dipping and gluten-free pasta tossed in my Cashew Alfredo! (For more side and sauce options, check the options in the post above.)Best when fresh. But you can store completely cooled leftover eggplant covered in the refrigerator up to 2 days. Reheat on a baking sheet in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until hot."
146,Romesco Soup with Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Romesco Soup with Smashed Chickpeas

Friends, I’ve been SO excited to share this recipe with you ever since I perfected it a while back.
It’s inspired by a soup we had at a vegan cafe in Iceland called Kaffi Vinyl. It reminded me so much of romesco sauce, which finds its roots in Spanish cooking. Romesco is traditionally made with almonds (or other nuts) peppers, garlic, and red wine vinegar.
As you can imagine, my mind was spinning with ideas on how to recreate this soup once we got home, and the final result totally blew me away. Let’s make soup!

This recipe is quite easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients andsimple methods.
It all starts with roasting red bell peppers, almonds,and garlic until brown and toasty. Then they go into the blender with spices like paprika, sea salt, and harissa for a smoky, spicy flavor.

And the magic comes next: We add our Homemade Vegetable Broth which transforms this sauce into soup! All that’s left is a little red wine vinegar for acidity, maple syrup or coconut sugar for a bit of natural sweetness, and a bit more salt for overall flavor balance.

I also added chickpeas for more heartiness and plant-based fiber and protein!

I hope you all LOVE this soup! It’s:
Hearty
Rich
Flavorful
Vegetable-Packed
Fiber- + Protein-rich
Satisfying
Comforting
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect lighter yet satisfying meal when you want something on the table fast. It would feed a crowd or be perfect for making ahead and packing as leftovers for lunch throughout the week.
This soup is absolutely delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with things like my Apple Pecan Arugula Salad, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, Vegan Pesto Parmesan Breadsticks, Fluffy Vegan Spelt Rolls, Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables, or Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower Steak.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and arrange red peppers, still whole with stems, on one end of a clean baking sheet. On the other end, arrange almonds and garlic (still in skin). If making a larger batch, use more baking sheets, if needed.Place baking sheet in oven and roast almonds for 10-12 minutes or until slightly cracked and golden brown. Then remove almonds from pan and set aside. Continue baking garlic for another 5-8 minutes. Then remove and set aside.With peppers still on baking sheet, increase heat to 475 degrees F (246 C). Allow red peppers to roast until skin is bubbled and mostly blackened, turning/flipping halfway through to char both sides (~10 minutes).Once they're properly charred, wrap roasted red peppers in foil and steam for 2-3 minutes. Then peel away skin, seeds, and core. Also remove skin from roasted garlic.Add peeled peppers, almonds, garlic, diced tomatoes, vinegar, paprika, sea salt, pepper, maple syrup or coconut sugar, and (optional) harissa or pepper flake to a high-speed blender. Purée until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired, adding more harissa or pepper flake for heat, salt for saltiness, vinegar for acidity, maple syrup or coconut sugar for sweetness, or paprika for smokiness.Add the soup to a large pot and add the vegetable broth and smashed chickpeas. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Then reduce heat to low and continue simmering for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.Serve as is or with a bit of pine nuts, fresh herbs, vegan parmesan cheese, or your favorite bread or roll.Leftovers keep well covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best when fresh."
147,How to Make Vegetable Broth | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Vegetable Broth

Friends! I’m so excited to bring you this delicious kitchen staple that is SO easy to make. I’ve been telling all of my friends how they should start doing it, too.
Consider yourself part of the inner circle who gets in on a secret: Making vegetable broth is what all the cool kids are doing. Let me show you how!

This broth is easy to make, requiring just 1 pot and basic ingredients you likely have on hand year-round.
The inspiration for making my own broth originally came from my palPhoebe, who shared in her wellness book about making broth from vegetable scraps and garlic and onion skins collected throughout the week. BRILLIANT! Why had no one told me this before?
Ever since, I’ve been saving a big bag of vegetable scraps (carrot peels and tops, greens on their last leg, onion ends, etc.) in a bag in my freezer, and when it’s full, I know it’s broth time.

I start by sautéing the sturdier vegetables down until soft and tender. Then I add water, salt, pepper, and herbs.
Herbs add the “umami” to the soup, in my opinion. I went with fresh thyme, parsley, and rosemary and a bay leaf for good measure.
And for even more depth of flavor? Tomato paste and nutritional yeast! I know it sounds like an unlikely combination that makes this broth cheesy and tomato-heavy. But a little goes a long way in adding extra “oomph” to the broth and helps take it from vegetable water to AMAZING broth!

After about 1 hour of simmering on low, the flavors develop and your broth is ready to go.
Of course, you can cook it longer (the longer the better, really). But 1 hour is about the minimum for truly delicious broth. All that’s left to do is strain into storage jars and you’re set!

I hope you all LOVE this broth! It’s:
Hearty
Rich
Flavorful
Versatile
Easy to make
Healthy
&amp; Super delicious
This broth makes the PERFECT base for soups, sauces, gravy, and all kinds of recipes, like my1-Pot Vegan Minestrone, Simple Vegan Stuffing, Easy Vegan Poutine, Thyme &amp; White Bean Pot Pies, Mushroom &amp; Leek Risotto, Tomato &amp; Vegetable White Bean Soup, 1-Pot Curried Lentil Potato Soup, and Coconut Curry Ramen.

","Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Add 1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (amount as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and stir to coat. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until softened and slightly browned, stirring frequently.Add water, greens, parsley, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, and another 1/2 tsp sea salt and black pepper (amount as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and increase heat to medium high until the mixture comes to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and add nutritional yeast and tomato paste (add less of both for less intense flavor, or more for bigger more robust flavor!). Stir to combine and loosely cover (with the lid cracked).Continue cooking for at least 30 minutes, preferably 45 minutes to 1 hour. The flavor will deepen the longer it cooks.Near the end of cooking, taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more herbs for herby/earthy flavor, salt for saltiness, pepper for a little spice, or tomato paste or nutritional yeast for ""umami"" and depth of flavor. In total, I added about 2 tsp sea salt and black pepper (amount as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and all of the suggested amount of nutritional yeast and tomato paste (both of which add depth of flavor and make the broth rich).Let cool slightly before pouring over a strainer into another pot. Then divide between storage vessels (I prefer glass mason jars). Let cool completely before sealing. Store in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month (sometimes longer). Perfect for use in soups, recipes, gravy, and more! Recipes listed above."
148,Avocado Banana Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Avocado Banana Green Smoothie

Whenever we travel, the one thing I’m usually able to find, wherever we go, is a smoothie.
Thankfully, they seem to be readily available and a great way to get in some vegetables and fruit, which helps me feel a bit more “in my routine” even when I’m not. This creamy avocado smoothie was inspired by a recent trip to Iceland, where I hit the smoothie jackpot. Let me show you how it’s made!

This creamy avocado smoothie is easy to make, requiring just 5 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes.
The base is frozen banana, which creates a creamy, naturally sweet base. Next comes the star ingredient: avocado! Full of fiber and healthy fats, avocado makes this smoothie creamy and dreamy and thick, almost like a milkshake.

Next comes dairy-free milk for a smooth and dreamy texture and some greens of choice for fiber, nutrients, and a beautiful green hue. Protein powder is the final ingredient, which takes this smoothie into meal territory. I’ve done a whole review on protein powders, so give it a look to see my favorites.

I hope you all love this smoothie! It’s:
Thick + Creamy
Satisfying
Naturally sweet
Gorgeous
Full of vitamins and minerals
Fiber- + Protein-rich
Versatile
&amp; Super delicious
Try making this smoothie in the morning for a quick on-the-go breakfast. It would also make a delicious snack or even healthier “dessert” in the evenings. Throw in a little peanut butter for more of a “milkshake” vibe. Serious yum.

","To a high-speed blender, add frozen banana, avocado, protein powder of choice, greens, and dairy-free milk. At this time, add any desired add-ins, such as adaptogens, seeds, or additional fruits and vegetables (such as berries or cucumbers).Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. If smoothie is too thick, add more dairy-free milk to thin. If too thin, add more frozen banana or avocado.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana for sweetness, avocado for creaminess, or greens for vibrant green color. Protein powder can also be used to add more sweetness (depending on brand / flavor).Divide between serving glasses and enjoy! Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 24 hours or in the freezer up to 2 weeks."
149,Vegan Pumpkin Mac 'n' Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Mac ‘n’ Cheese

It’s pumpkin season (!!) and I haven’t been able to shake the idea of pumpkin pasta from my mind since I spotted the first pumpkins at the grocery store. Friends, let’s make creamy, dreamy pumpkin mac ‘n’ cheese!

This easy pumpkin pasta requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods. I even show you how to roast a pumpkin so you can impress your friends and family with this from-scratch meal. (Or buy canned pumpkin to save time!)
Once your pumpkin is roasted, it’s time to make the sauce, which is a simple mixture of ingredients like sage, garlic, nutritional yeast, almond milk, and vegan parmesan cheese. I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice to add some warmth and spice as well as an optional pinch of red pepper flake for some heat.

Once you cook your pasta, all that’s left to do is mix it with your sauce and serve! I opted to sprinkle on more vegan parmesan cheese, broil for a crusty topping, and garnish it with a bit of sautéed sage (which I consider extra-fancy but nonessential touches).

I hope you all LOVE this pasta! It’s:
Creamy
Cheesy
Pumpkin-infused
Satisfying
Comforting
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving something hearty yet healthy this fall and winter. It would also make a beautiful holiday entrée or side dish. While it’s delicious on its own, it would also pair well with this Creamy Kale Salad with Chickpeas &amp; Shallots, Apple Pecan Arugula Salad, or Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables!

","If baking your pumpkin, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Otherwise, if using canned pumpkin puree, skip to step 4.Using a sharp knife, cut the tops of your pumpkin off and then cut pumpkin in half. Use a sharp spoon or ice cream scoop to scrape out all the seeds and strings. (Save the seeds for roasting!)Optional: Brush the flesh with a neutral, high heat oil, such as avocado. And place flesh down on the baking sheet.Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a fork easily pierces the skin. In the last 20 minutes of roasting, add the two cloves of garlic still in skin to the baking sheet to slightly brown and soften. Then remove pan from the oven and let the pumpkin cool. Also peel garlic cloves and set aside.If serving with pasta, start boiling water and cooking pasta at this time. Once pasta is cooked, drain and set aside. Optional: I like to drizzle mine with a little olive or avocado oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and vegan parmesan cheese for extra flavor.To make the sauce, add 2 cups (as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) baked pumpkin (or pumpkin puree) to a high-speed blender along with peeled roasted garlic, arrowroot starch, dairy-free milk (starting with amount at lower end of range), sea salt, sage or thyme (I used both), nutritional yeast, vegan parmesan cheese, pumpkin pie spice, and red pepper flake (optional).Blend on high until creamy and smooth. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed. Add more salt for saltiness, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, sage or thyme for herbiness, vegan parmesan cheese for depth of flavor, pumpkin pie spice for pumpkin flavor and warmth, or red pepper flake for spice (optional).To heat/thicken the sauce, pour into a rimmed skillet and heat over medium-low heat, whisking frequently until sauce is hot and slightly thickened - 3-5 minutes. If it gets too thick, thin with a bit more dairy-free milk.To serve, add cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. Serve as is or (optional) sprinkle with 2 Tbsp (10 g // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegan parmesan cheese and broil on medium for 1-3 minutes, watching very carefully until barely browned.Enjoy hot and garnish with pine nuts or sautéed sage if desired.

150,Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart

Friends, the holiday season is upon us and I’m so excited to offer up this easy plant-based dessert everyone will love and no one will suspect is dairy- or gluten-free. Let’s do this!

The crust for this gorgeous 10-ingredient tart is a blend of rolled oats and almonds naturally sweetened with a hint of coconut sugar and maple syrup. Coconut oil adds moisture and allows the tart to crisp up in the oven beautifully.
Next is the filling, which is a simple blend of ingredients like coconut yogurt, soaked cashews, maple syrup, and lemon. The filling is poured over the baked (and cooled) crust and cooled as we work on the topping!

For a topping, I put my Cinnamon Baked Apples to good use. They’re naturally sweetened, require 1 bowl, and come together quickly while the tart chills. And before you know it, you have a gorgeous fall dessert on your hands that’s perfect for just about any occasion.

I hope you all LOVE this tart! It’s:
Tender on the inside
Crisp on the outside
Perfectly (and naturally) sweet
Simple to make
Versatile in toppings
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make thee perfect dessert as we move into the holiday season. No one will guess it’s dairy- or gluten-free. It’s incredibly rich and satisfying, and you can top it with virtually any fruit you have on hand.

","Start by making preparations for filling. If making coconut yogurt, do so first. Otherwise, proceed with store-bought or sub coconut milk or cream (see note in instructions about extra lemon juice).Next, soak your cashews in very hot water for 1 hour or 6-8 hours in cool water. Then drain and set aside. If using soaked cashews more than 1 hour after draining, cover and refrigerate for up to 4-5 hours (continuing the soak can make them mealy or too soft).Meanwhile, prepare crust by preheating oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and adding oats, almonds, sea salt, coconut sugar and maple syrup to a high-speed blender or food processor. Pulse into a fine meal. Then add coconut oil and and pulse until a crust ""dough"" forms that holds together when you squeeze it between your fingers. If it appears too dry, add more melted coconut oil 1 Tbsp (15 g) at at time and blend. I found 5 Tbsp (75 g // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to be about right.Line a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (or sub a pie pan or 8x8-inch baking dish) with parchment paper. I did this by cutting out a circle that fit in the bottom of the pan and just reached the edges (if using an 8x8 dish, extend parchment paper up over the edges).Then add the crust mixture to the pan and use your hands to spread it into an even layer, pushing the crust up to the edges of the pan so it contains the filling well. To achieve a uniform layer, cover a flat-bottom object (such as a drinking glass) with parchment paper and press down firmly.Bake for 15 minutes. Then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool for 5 minutes. Then carefully transfer to the freezer to chill.Make filling by adding coconut yogurt, soaked and drained cashews, the lesser amount of maple syrup (2 Tbsp (30 ml) as recipe is written), lemon juice, melted coconut oil, vanilla (optional), and sea salt. Blend on high until creamy and smooth. Then taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more lemon for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, or vanilla for intense vanilla flavor.Remove cooled crust from the freezer and pour the filling onto it. Gently tap a few times to release any air bubbles. Then set back in the freezer (I set mine on a baking sheet to keep it flat) and freeze until firm to the touch - about 2-3 hours.While this happens, prepare desired fruit topping. I went with a half batch (3-4 apples instead of 6-7 // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) Cinnamon Baked Apples, but fresh fruit would also be lovely here. The important thing to remember is the apples (or any baked fruit) need to be cooled completely before being added to the top of the tart or it will melt.To serve, make sure the tart has set out for at least 1 hour from the freezer so the filling is more the consistency of cheesecake. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator (freezing isn't necessary) for up to 4 days."

The base is a simple mixture of vegetables and lentils simmered with fresh thyme in vegetable broth until tender and flavorful. Next up? If you dare, these balsamic-glazed portobello mushrooms, which add another layer of hearty goodness to this pie.

For topping, in place of traditional white potatoes (like in my 1-Hour Vegan Shepherd’s Pie), I went for sweet potatoes (the best potatoes, in my opinion).
Simply boil then mash with a little salt and coconut oil. Then it’s time to layer up all of this goodness.

First, lay down the lentils and vegetables. Then add the balsamic portobellos (optional but dreamy!). And then top with fluffy mashed sweet potatoes. Swoon! Just 20 minutes in the oven and you’re good to go!

I hope you all LOVE this shepherd’s pie! It’s:
Hearty
Comforting
Healthy
Satisfying
Flavorful
Versatile
&amp; Delicious!
This would make the perfect entrée for holiday gatheringsorhosting a crowd of mixed eaters – plant-based folks and meat-eaters alike will love this one! It’s also ideal for making in advance and reheating throughout the week for quick meals on the go (hello, best leftover lunch ever).
While delicious on its own, it would also pair well with my Creamy Kale Salad with Shallot and Chickpeas,Fluffy Spelt Rolls, Vegan Gluten-Free Biscuits,and pretty much everything in this Vegan Thanksgiving Round-Up!

","Place sweet potatoes in a large pot and fill with water until they’re just covered. Bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce to medium-high heat and cook for 15-20 minutes or until they slide off a knife very easily.Once cooked, drain and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Use a masher or fork to mash until smooth (see photo). Add coconut oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Depending on the sweetness of sweet potatoes, add a bit of maple syrup to taste (optional). Loosely cover and set aside.While potatoes are cooking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch (or similar size) baking dish (or more baking dishes, as needed, if altering batch size).If adding (optional), add portobello mushrooms to a shallow dish or large Ziploc bag. Top with balsamic vinegar, oil (optional), salt, pepper, and garlic. Toss to combine and let marinate for 5 minutes.Next heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onions, and garlic and sauté until lightly browned and caramelized - about 4-5 minutes.Add a pinch each salt and pepper. Then add lentils, vegetable broth, and thyme and stir. Bring to a low boil. Then reduce heat to simmer. Continue cooking until lentils are tender (20-30 minutes).(If adding mushrooms) while lentils cook, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a dash of oil and the mushrooms with their marinade. Spread into an even layer and cook on one side for 2-3 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook on other side for 2-3 minutes. Then remove from heat and set aside.In the last 10 minutes of cooking the lentils, add the frozen veggies, stir, and cover to meld the flavors together. Drain off any extra vegetable stock (there shouldn't be much). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt and pepper for overall flavor.Transfer the lentil mixture to your oven-safe baking dish and top with portobello mushrooms (optional) then mashed sweet potatoes. Smooth down with a spoon or fork and season with another crack of pepper and a little sea salt (and more thyme if desired).Set on a baking sheet to catch any overflow and bake for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are lightly browned on top and the edges are bubbling.Let cool briefly before serving. The longer it sits, the more it will thicken. Let cool completely before covering, and then store in the fridge up to 4-5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheats well in the microwave or in the oven."
152,Vegan Ricotta & Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Ricotta &amp; Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Salad

I know that summer is over and all (at least on this side of the planet), but can we please pretend like the sun is out and we’re in tank tops, riding bikes to get ice cream? Or at least can we keep making pretty salads for lunch? I can settle for the latter if you throw in a fireplace (’cause dang, it’s cold outside).
Deal.

This salad was inspired by a sandwich I had when we werein Iceland. I found a juice shop (Jo &amp; The Juice!) that served up sandwiches on GF bread with a pesto-y dressing, fresh tomatoes, and ripe avocado. Swoon.
I had intentions of making a similar sandwich as the recipe. But, honestly, I need more greens (and less bread) in my life right now, so salad it was. (However, this would be bomb with avocado on toasted sourdough instead of greens.)

This recipe requires less than 30 minutes to throw together even with the Easy Vegan Pesto dressing and Whipped Almond Ricotta.
The only other elements are cooked chickpeas and pine nuts for some plant-based fiber and proteinand sun-dried tomatoes for texture and depth of flavor. You could also throw in some avocado, but I didn’t find it necessary. And for more carbs (#carblife), toss in some cooked gluten-free pasta (like this Pea Pesto Pasta Salad!).
I hope you all love this easy, bright-and-cheery salad. It’s versatile, flavorful, satisfying, and the perfect lunch or light dinner.

153,Easy 1-Pot Marinara Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Marinara Sauce

With as much pasta and lasagna as I cook in my kitchen, I don’t know why it took me so long to share my favorite marinara sauce recipe with you. In any case, it was worth the wait.
Let me show you how simple it is to make this basic kitchen staple.

This 1-pot, 9-ingredient recipe is forgiving. As long as you start with quality tomatoes and herbs, the rest kind of happens naturally.
Plus, I include a couple of hero ingredients that save the day if things are tasting lackluster (a cook always need a good backup plan).

I prefer using canned crushed, peeled tomatoes, but diced work as well. In fact, I keep a few cans in the kitchen at all times in case I need a quick penne and red sauce to save the day.
Next comes flavor in the way of garlic, fresh basil, oregano, red pepper flake, and sea salt. Coconut sugar keeps things naturally sweetenedand may seem like an unlikely addition. But sometimes tomatoes can be a bit astringent and bitter, and because this marinara is quite salty, the sweetness balances and enhances the flavors of the sauce.
And what if, at the end, it just needs some extra oomph? Tomato paste and nutritional yeast to the rescue (for a little “umami” effect and more depth of flavor – trust me on this one).

I hope you all LOVE my take on marinara. It’s:
Hearty
Rich
Flavorful
Easy to make (1 pot!)
Healthy
Versatile
&amp; Perfect for pasta night
This is the perfect sauce for dishes like Spaghetti Squash Pasta,Eggplant Lasagna Roll Ups, Easy Vegan Pizza, Garlicky Pesto Breadsticks (for dipping), Vegan Meatballs, Chickpea Bolognese, Lentil Bolognese, and more. Add a dash of Vegan Pesto to the sauce for an even herbier flavor. Or a spoonful of my Vegan Tofu Ricotta or Whipped Almond Ricotta to take it to the creamier side!
If you’re looking for cheesy things to pair with this sauce, be sure to check out my Vegan Parmesan Cheese (the perfect topper for any Italian-inspired dish) and Vegan Mozzarella “Cheese” (layered on top of your favorite pizza).

","Heat a large pot over medium-low heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and garlic. Sauté briefly for 1 minute, stirring frequently, until barely golden brown. Then add tomatoes, oregano, coconut sugar, salt, and pepper flake.Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add basil and stir. Cook for 5 minutes more.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, oregano or basil for freshness/herbed flavor, pepper flake for heat, or coconut sugar for sweetness. At this time, you can also choose to add nutritional yeast and/or tomato paste for more depth of flavor and richness (optional, but I usually add both).If the sauce has thickened too much at this point, thin with a little water. Although I prefer mine thicker and leave it on the thick/chunky side.Serve with your favorite Italian dishes, such as Eggplant Roll-Ups, Eggplant Lasagna, Chickpea Bolognese, Spaghetti Squash Lasagna, or Veggie Meatballs. Or simply over a serving of cooked pasta of choice or spaghetti squash.Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 1 week, or in the freezer up to 1 month."
154,Butternut Squash Bowl with Jalapeño Queso | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butternut Squash Bowl with Jalapeño Queso

The butternut squash bowl. Finally, another reason to put queso on things. Because everyone knows that the world needs more (cashew) queso. Truth.

This easy weeknight meal comes together relatively quickly if you already have your queso made (which I usually do, and you probably should, too). And itrequires 10 fall-friendly ingredients that remain incredibly versatile depending on what you have on hand.
I’ve been stocking plenty of squash in the house lately, and because butternut squash is slightly sweet, I knew that it would play well with cumin, chili powder, and – of course – my Roasted Jalapeño Queso. But, really, any squash (or sweet potato!) should play well here.

For other toppings, I went with fresh red cabbage (which you could also sauté if you prefer it more tender), ripe avocado, and shishito peppers (any pepper will do!)
For more protein (which I wasn’t too worried about thanks to the cashew queso), you could easily add something like cooked black beans, Smoky Chipotle Tempeh, or even quinoa.

I hope you all LOVE this butternut squash bowl! It’s:
Hearty
Comforting
Fall-inspired
Versatile
Super flavorful
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal or even a great dish for hosting, as the recipe can easily be double or tripled. It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with my Ginger Beer Margaritas, Mexican Quinoa Salad, or Vegan Kale Chip Nachos!

155,30-Minute Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry

This is one of those recipes you want in your back pocket for days when you need something on the table fast and you’d prefer it to be healthy, satisfying, and pretty if at all possible.
Easy weeknight cauliflower rice stir-fry to the rescue!

This easy, versatile,30-minute recipe starts with my favorite rice substitute: cauliflower!
It’s neutral in flavor, marries well with so many dishes, is full of fiber, and adds even more plant-based goodness to this dish. There’s nothing wrong with rice, by the way (let me make that clear!). But some days you just need more vegetables in your life. (Raise hand if this is you, or am I the only one?)

The sauce is vibrant, flavorful, and made of ingredients you likely have on hand right now like almond butter, maple syrup, lime juice, coconut aminos (or tamari or soy sauce), and chili garlic (or hot) sauce.
The beauty of this recipe is you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I went with green beans, bell pepper, cabbage, and green onion. But, really, the options are endless.

I hope you all LOVE this stir-fry! It’s:
Hearty
Healthy
Flavorful
Satisfying
Quick + Easy
Versatile
&amp; Delicious
This dish would be perfect as a quick lunch at home and especially ideal as an easy weeknight meal when you don’t have a lot of time to get something on the table. Plus, it reheats beautifully, which makes it perfect for leftovers the next day.

","Follow instructions for cauliflower rice. Set aside.Prepare sauce by adding oil (or water), almond or peanut butter, coconut aminos, lime juice, chili garlic sauce, fresh ginger, maple syrup, and water to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, lime for acidity, coconut aminos for saltiness, ginger for ""zing,"" or maple syrup for sweetness. Set aside.Heat a large rimmed skillet (I prefer this cast-iron skillet) over medium-low heat and add cauliflower rice and water. Stir and cover with a lid to steam. Cook for 4-6 minutes or until just tender. Then turn off heat, tip the lid to let some steam out, and set aside.Heat a separate large rimmed skillet (or pot) over medium heat. Once hot, add sesame oil (or water) and green beans. Season with one-third of the coconut aminos (1 Tbsp or 15 ml as original recipe is written) and toss to combine. Cover with lid (to steam) and cook for a total of 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add bell pepper, green onion, cabbage, and remaining two thirds of the coconut aminos (2 Tbsp  or 30 ml as original recipe is written) and stir to combine. Sauté for 3-4 minutes or until just tender. Then add cashews and cauliflower rice and stir to combine. (Alternatively, serve stir-fry over cauliflower rice and don't add to the vegetables at this time.)Add the sauce, increase the heat to medium-high heat, and cook until well combined and the mixture is very hot - about 3 minutes.Serve and enjoy! Delicious on its own, but also delicious with the addition of fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and hot sauce of choice.Best when fresh, but leftovers keep up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer. Reheat on the stovetop until hot. Add more coconut aminos as needed."

158,How to Roast Spaghetti Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Roast Spaghetti Squash

If you’ve ever wondered how to cook a spaghetti squash, you’ve come to the right place. Let me show you how with this step-by-step tutorial!
You’ll have ready-to-eat spaghetti squash on the table in less than hour.
It all starts by halving your squash and scooping out your seeds, which I love to do with an ice cream scoop for efficiency.
Then, it’s into the oven to roast. You can either go for an oil-free version with some water added to the pan for moisture, or – my preferred – brush the inside with a little oil and sprinkle of salt and roast in a 400-degree oven for 45 minutes or until fork tender.

Then it’s the fun part! Use a fork to make “spaghetti noodles” out of the squash, at which point it’s ready to enjoy with a little olive oil, vegan parmesan cheese, and sprinkle of salt and fresh herbs, Easy Vegan Pesto, or red sauce!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large rimmed baking sheet or baking dish with parchment paper or foil.Carefully halve spaghetti squash lengthwise using a sharp knife. I find the best way to do this is inserting the very tip of a very sharp large knife into the side of the squash (lengthwise) and push it all the way through to the other side. Then rock the knife back and forth to cut one half all the way through, then repeat on the other side.Use an ice cream scoop (or sharp spoon) to scrape out the seeds and most of the stringy parts.Brush the interior with oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Place cut-side down on baking sheet. Roast for 45 minutes, or until a knife easily pierces the skin and flesh. Remove from oven and set aside.Note: For a more moist squash, omit the oil and instead add just enough water to cover the bottom of your baking sheet or baking dish and bake at 400 degrees F (204 C) until a knife easily pierces the exterior - about 35-45 minutes.Once slightly cool, flip squash flesh-side up and use a fork to scrape out the strings.

159,Dark Chocolate Coconut Butter Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Chocolate Coconut Butter Cups

I’ve been on a coconut kick lately. Coconut milk in my smoothies. Coconut yogurt on top of everything. And coconut butter for a midday snack (yes, spoon straight into the jar – no shame).
So it was only a matter of time before I fused my favorite new snack with my favorite dark chocolate! These cups are a match made in heaven. Let me show you how!

This recipe is easy, requiring just 5 ingredients!
The base is this simple vegan dark chocolate made with cocoa butter, coconut oil, maple syrup, and cocoa (or cacao) powder. Swoon.

And the filling is my 1-ingredient coconut butter!
Also called “coconut manna,” coconut butter is made by simply blending unsweetened shredded coconut in a food processor for 5-10 minutes until it makes this creamy, liquid-gold substance that’s fiber-rich, sugar-free, and utterly delicious.

The layering process is simple: a little chocolate, a little coconut butter, a little more chocolate on top, and BAM – you have chocolate coconut butter cups on your hands!

I hope you all LOVE these coconut butter cups! They’re:
Chocolaty
Coconutty
Indulgent yet healthy
Naturally sweetened
Satisfying
&amp; SO delicious
These would make the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand throughout the week. They would also make a delicious gift and healthier Halloween candy (!!).

","Prepare coconut butter and set aside (see link in ingredients).Add 2 inches of water to a medium saucepan and bring to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat. Then reduce heat to medium and set a medium glass or ceramic mixing bowl on top, making sure it's not touching the water (this creates a ""double boiler"").To the mixing bowl, add finely chopped cocoa butter and coconut oil and let melt, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or whisk - about 2-3 minutes.Once melted, carefully remove bowl from heat (turn off stove) and add maple syrup. First add cacao or cocoa powder to a sifter and sift over mixture. Then use a whisk or wooden spoon to mix until smooth and thoroughly combined. At this time, add optional sea salt and vanilla if desired.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added about 2 Tbsp maple syrup total (amount as original recipe is written // alter if adjusting batch size), but it’s completely up to how sweet you prefer your chocolate.Because the chocolate is quite thin at this point, set in the refrigerator to chill, slightly thicken, and make coating the cupcake wrappers easier - about 15-20 minutes total, removing to stir/whisk occasionally. You'll know it's ready when it's more like pourable hot fudge than melted coconut oil.Line a standard muffin tin with 10 (alter amount if adjusting batch size) paper cupcake liners and add 2 Tbsp (~30 g) of the chocolate to each. Use a spoon to gently push some of the chocolate up so it slightly coats the paper liners. Then set in the refrigerator or freezer to chill for 10 minutes.Once the chocolate is slightly firmer, add 1 1/2 Tbsp (~27 g) coconut butter to each. Then set back in the refrigerator or freezer to chill for 10 minutes or until the coconut butter is slightly hardened to the touch.Add remaining chocolate (~1 1/2 Tbsp each) on top of the coconut butter and use a spoon to ensure that the coconut butter is fully covered. Then set back in the refrigerator or freezer to chill for 10-15 minutes or until the cups are firm to the touch.Enjoy straight from the refrigerator or freezer. Or let set out and thaw for 10-15 minutes and enjoy at room temperature for a softer coconut butter cup (my favorite).Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks or in the freezer up to 1 month."
160,1-Pot Pumpkin Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Pumpkin Yellow Curry

Two words: Pumpkin Curry.
Friends, this fall has me going crazy over all things apple and and squash, and this curry may be one of my favorite curry recipes to date! Shall we?

This simple curry requires just 1 pot to make! It all starts with gorgeous pumpkin, which is peeled, seeded, and cubed into bite-size chunks.
The flavor comes in waves thanks to ingredients likecurry paste, chili peppers, ginger, garlic, and shallot – a.k.a. the curry dream team.

For vegetables, I went with vibrant red bell pepper and broccoli. That’s all you really need!
And to keep the curry creamy and rich, I opted for light coconut milk, which complements the spicy flavors perfectly.

For a healthy fat and EASY protein, I went with roasted cashews (something I always have on hand). But, if you aren’t into cashews or can’t do nuts, you could also add Quick Crispy Tofu, includeRed Lentils, or simply serve over quinoa.

I hope you all LOVE this curry! It’s:
Creamy
Subtly spiced
Pumpkin-y
Vegetable-rich
Hearty
Satisfying
Comforting
&amp; Delicious!
Make this curry for hosting guests this winter and fallor when you need a satisfying dinner on the table fast. It would be an especially great dish to make ahead and pack for lunches throughout the week, as it reheats beautifully!
It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with my Thai Spring Rolls, 20-minute Asian Kale Salad, Coconut Curried Greens, Coconut Curried Lentils, or even Thai Iced Tea!

","Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil, shallot, ginger, garlic, and pepper. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.Add bell pepper and curry paste and stir. Cook for 2 minutes more. Then add pumpkin and stir. Cook for 2 minutes more.Add coconut milk, maple syrup or coconut sugar, turmeric, sea salt, and coconut aminos and stir. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.Once simmering, slightly reduce heat to low and cover. You want a simmer, not a boil, which should be around low to medium-low heat.Cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to soften the pumpkin and infuse it with curry flavor.At this time, also taste and adjust the flavor of the sauce/broth as needed. I added more maple syrup for sweetness, sea salt for saltiness, and a bit more curry paste for a more intense curry flavor. Don't be shy with seasonings - this curry should be very flavorful.Once the broth is well seasoned and the pumpkin is tender, add broccoli, lemon juice, and cashews and cover. Simmer for 3-4 minutes more over low to medium-low heat.Optional: Scoop out half of the broth/sauce and half of the pumpkin (try to exclude the broccoli) and blend until creamy and smooth in a blender for a thicker, creamier curry. Return to pot and warm for a few minutes before serving.Serve as is or over rice, quinoa, or cauliflower rice. This dish gets elevated with the addition of fresh lemon juice and Thai or regular basil or cilantro for serving.Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days or in the freezer for 1 month.

161,Cinnamon Baked Apples | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Cinnamon Baked Apples

Apple season is officially here (!!) and I’ve been dreaming about this baked apple recipe for a while now. Dreams came true in my kitchen when I opened up the oven to see these tender, cinnamon-coated, perfectly caramelized apples! Let me show you how.

This recipe is simple, requiring 9 (basic) ingredients and 1 bowl.
A mix of tart and sweet apples are peeled, cored, thinly sliced, and added right to the baking dish before being topped with delicious spices like cinnamon, fresh ginger, and nutmeg. Total swoon.

To keep this dish naturally sweetened, I went with coconut sugar (you could also sub stevia or maple syrup)!
Coconut sugar provides a slightly caramelized flavor I adore. All that’s left is lemon juice and sea salt to balance out the sweetnessand a touch of cornstarch or arrowroot to ensure the sauce thickens up nicely. Forty-five minutes in the oven covered then another 10 uncovered and you’re in cinnamon-apple paradise.


I hope you all LOVE these baked apples! They’re:
Tender
Cinnamony
Naturally sweetened
Caramelized

162,Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables

I’ve been playing around with oil-free dishes for two reasons: 1) I’m curious to see if you can make dishes oil-free while maintaining delicious flavor and texture. And 2) many of you have been asking for oil-free recipes*, so I wanted to provide this as a resource!
Spoiler alert: It totally works! Let me show you how.

This recipe requires simple ingredients (whatever seasonal vegetables you have available to you) and simple seasonings (whatever flavors make you happy).
I’ve been loving this DIY curry powder, which added a complex kick of flavor to the vegetables I had on hand, which in this case were a mix of starchy and non-starchy vegetables. More on that soon…

Here’s the trick I’ve found to work best:
Steam starchy vegetables first until just tender and then finish roasting in the oven. And for non-starchy vegetables, throw them straight into the oven with just the seasonings (no steaming necessary). They don’t need the extra moisture because they are more tender and have a higher water content in most instances, so steaming would make them soggy.
So in this instance, I chose to steam the sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts. And then I added the broccolini, beets, cauliflower, peppers, cabbage, and zucchini straight into the oven to roast.

You’ll know that your vegetables are done when they’re tender and slightly golden brown on the outside. Or, if you like crispy vegetables, continue roasting until deeper golden brown (just be careful not to burn). And that’s it! Easy, oil-free roasted vegetables that are perfect for just about any occasion.

I hope you all LOVE these vegetables. They’re:
Easy
Quick
Versatile
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Flavorful
&amp; Delicious
Add these vegetables to just about any dish to bring some plant-based goodness to your plate. Think breakfast scrambles, salads, quinoa bowls, pastas, wraps, and more! You can also pair these vegetables with my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese for a delicious crudité!

*Know that we are not saying an oil-free diet is the way to go (we use oil in plenty of recipes). We are only providing a resource for people who want to try to reduce the amount of added oils in their diet.
","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.Place a large pot or rimmed skillet on the stovetop and fill with 1/2 inch water. Bring to a boil over high heat.Once boiling, lower heat to medium-high (you’re going for a low boil) and carefully place a steamer basket inside (I like this one - or sub a small colander or fine mesh strainer that rests over the water but not in the water).Add the starchy vegetables (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes - Brussels sprouts are optional and should only be added if you like more tender Brussels - otherwise, set aside).Cover pot or skillet and steam the vegetables for 4-6 minutes or until just tender. A knife should easily pierce the vegetables but not easily slide all the way through. You’re looking for them to be moist and slightly tender.Transfer the steamed starchy vegetables to one baking sheet, and arrange the non-starchy vegetables on the other baking sheet. Season to taste with salt and curry powder, and toss to coat.Bake for a total of 20-30 minutes or to desired doneness. The broccolini seems to require just 15 minutes, while the cabbage, bell pepper, and cauliflower benefit from a longer roast - up to 25-30 minutes. (Once steamed), the starchy vegetables shouldn’t need more than 20 minutes in the oven. Steamed Brussels need to be roasted for 15 minutes, while unsteamed Brussels can roast for up to 20-25 minutes. Just watch the oven closely and check for doneness.At this point, they’re ready to serve! However, I find that the vegetables are enhanced with a bit of fresh lemon juice, some herbs, and a drizzle of tahini.Store leftover vegetables covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Reheat over a cast-iron skillet or on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven until hot - about 10 minutes."

A nourishing, hearty bowl that’s perfect when you’re craving takeout but want something healthier instead. Plus, it’s ready in just 30 minutes! Let’s make curry bowls, friends.

This bowl is inspired by my Coconut Curried Golden Lentils, which are insanely flavorful and ready in 20 minutes. And they pair perfectly with the flavors going on in this dish.

In addition to lentils, I decided on cauliflower rice, easy roasted sweet potatoes, and steamed kale. And as an additional sauce, I whipped up a batch of my favorite cilantro chutney– an optional addition but certainly delicious!

164,Coconut Curried Golden Lentils | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Curried Golden Lentils (20 Minutes!)

Sometimes you want to make a recipe so badly that you dream about it. This is one of those recipes.
It may be their vibrant golden color, but I just couldn’t wait to cook up these lentils and put them on every bowl and salad from here to eternity.
And oh my did they deliver. Let’s do this!

This dish comes together in about 20 minutes from start to finish, thanks to the quick cooking time of yellow lentils (which I’ve found to be very similar in texture and cooking time to red lentils).
While you give your lentils a quick boil, prepare a coconut curry sauce with spices, ginger, garlic, and a healthy dose of coconut milk (check out my DIY Coconut Milk recipe).


Once the sauce is seasoned, add your lentils and stir. Finish with a bit more seasonings and some fresh lemon juice and “POW” – you have beautiful curried golden lentils!

Friends, I hope you LOVE these lentils. They’re:
Savory
Saucy
Perfectly spiced
Aromatic
Coconutty
Hearty + Satisfying
&amp; Seriously delicious
These curried lentils would be delicious atop rice, cauliflower rice, salads, bowls, and more. I could also see them being a delicious part of a wrap or sandwich.
And while delicious on their own, I think these would pair incredibly well with my Sweet Potato Cauliflower Curry, Avocado Sweet Potato Green Salad, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Curried Beet Soup with Chickpeas, and our Vegan Naan.

","Bring water to a boil in a large pot or saucepan. Add lentils and bring back to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cook lentils uncovered for 4-5 minutes or until just tender. Then drain and set aside. Be careful not to overcook or they can become mushy (cooking time will vary by variety of lentil - check package for instructions).In the meantime, heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil or water, shallot (optional), garlic, and ginger. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add salt, curry powder, turmeric, and cayenne and cook for 1 minute more. Lower heat to low.Add coconut milk and coconut sugar (or maple syrup) and stir to combine. Cook over low heat for 3-4 minutes to combine the flavors (see photo).Add the (well) drained, cooked lentils (see photo) to the coconut sauce and stir. They will likely need more seasoning at this point. I added a bit more salt, curry powder, turmeric, cayenne, and coconut sugar because I like big flavor. But season to taste.Turn off heat, add lemon juice, and stir. Then serve and enjoy! These are delicious on their own, but they would also be tasty with rice, cauliflower rice, steamed or roasted vegetables, and more."
165,5-Ingredient Vegan Almond Ricotta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whipped Almond Ricotta (5 Ingredients!)

I never thought vegan ricotta cheese could taste so good – until now. Friends, let’s make 5-ingredient vegan cheese!

The base for this seriously easy1-blender, 10-minutericotta is blanched slivered almonds. Because they’ve already been soaked and the skins removed, the almonds don’t need to be soakedbefore blending! Time = saved. In fact, I tried soaking them and didn’t like the end product nearly as much.
Because ricotta doesn’t typically have an intense cheesy flavor, the only additions it needs are nutritional yeast for a little cheesiness, lemon juice for tang, salt for saltiness, and a dash of garlic powder for depth of flavor.

Once blended, the “ricotta” is ready to go! Or you can set it in a cheesecloth and set it in the refrigerator to chill and harden a bit more. But if you’re in a hurry, the finished product is ready like that (in just 10 minutes)!

I hope you all LOVE this almond ricotta! It’s:
Creamy
Tangy
Cheesy
Satisfying
Versatile
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
Add this ricotta to things like my Zucchini Lasagna, My Favorite Vegan Pizza, or Stuffed Shells! It would also make a delicious addition to things like my Lentil Bolognese Sauce to make the sauce creamier and cheesier. YUM.

","Add all ricotta ingredients (starting with the lesser amount of water (3/4 cup/180 ml and salt (1/2 tsp) as original recipe is written) to a high-speed blender and blend until smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed (~2 minutes). You are looking for a well-puréed mixture with only very small bits of almonds intact. Add a bit more water a little at a time if the mixture is having a hard time blending until smooth.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for acidity. For even more flavor, you can add in some fresh basil, oregano, or parsley (optional).At this point, the “cheese” is ready to enjoy, especially in dishes like Lasagna, Pizza, or Stuffed Shells. However, it can also be wrapped in cheesecloth, formed into a ball, and placed into a fine mesh strainer set over a mixing bowl up to 3 days. This will allow the “cheese” to firm up a bit. However, this is optional. You can also transfer straight from blender to a storage container and refrigerate.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days."

It’s snack time!
Try these 1-bowl, 10-minute snack bites made with all of my favorite ingredients! Think tahini, coconut butter, cacao nibs, almonds, and dates. Serious yum. Let’s do this!

The dense, little snack bites are inspired by Lee from America’s Coconut Fat Balls, which I tried recently and really enjoyed.
I have since been modifying the recipe and came up with an inspired version of my own, which incorporates almond flour for firmer texture, tahini for nuttiness, and protein powder for a bit more staying power. The result is amazing – the perfect snack or healthier dessert I’ve been craving recently.
Mmm, just look at all that nutritious goodness happening in 1 bowl!
﻿

Once blended into a thick nutter-butter-like “dough,” it’s time for scooping! These bites form easily into rounds and are fairly forgiving to work with. No need to roll into balls, just make loose cookie/bite shapes and you’re good to go.
Then just a quick chill in the fridge or freezer and it’s snack time!

I hope you all LOVE these snack bites! They’re:
Coconutty
Tahini-infused
Chocolaty
Naturally sweet
Insanely satisfying

Consider this the only vegan alfredo sauce you need.
It’s the perfect dairy-free alternative to classic alfredo sauce! Plus, just 7 ingredients and 30 minutes required. Let’s do this!

The base of this alfredo is quick-soaked cashews in very hot water so they soften quickly. Then it’s a matter of flavor: nutritional yeast for cheesiness, garlic for kick and depth of flavor, salt for saltiness, and a bit of almond milk for texture. Arrowroot powder adds thickness and helps the sauce get a bit “stringy” like real cheese!


I hope you all enjoy this aflredo sauce! It’s:

168,Healing 3-Ingredient Turmeric Tea Tonic | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healing 3-Ingredient Turmeric Tonic

Ahhh, October is here and I couldn’t be more excited to get in cozy mode – a.k.a. living in sweaters and sweatpants and drinking all the turmeric tea tonic I can get my hands on. Let’s do this!

First of all, what is a tonic? Good question! It’sa ‘medicinal substance taken to give a feeling of vigor or well-being.’ (source)
I used to think of “tonic” as tonic water. But when I realized that it related more to a healing beverage or substance, I’ve been calling this recipe a “tonic” ever since!
This turmeric-ginger-lemon variety has been on repeat for some time now, so it was due time I share it with you all. It’s easy to make, requiring just 5 minutes, 3 ingredients, and 1 pot. Healthy and easy? Yeah, now we’re talking.

The base for this easy tonic is lemon juice, freshly grated ginger, and freshly grated turmeric. You can elect to add maple syrup, but I didn’t find it necessary! The only other thing I prefer is a little kick in the form of cayenne pepper.

So what makes this tonic healing? Good question.
Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which boasts amazing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. (source)
Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory andantioxidant thathas been known toaid digestion and relieve nausea. (source)
Lemon is naturally detoxifying and alkalizing in the body, aids in healthy bowel movements, and boasts plenty of Vitamin C, which boosts the immune system. (source)
And cayenne stimulates circulation, boosts metabolism, naturally relieves pain, and can have an alkalizing effect in the body. (source)
See? Told ya so.

I hope you all LOVE this tonic! It’s:
Healing
Warming
Comforting
Citrusy
Gingery
Easy to make
&amp; SO darn tasty
Make this tonic when you’re feeling down or sick, need to destress, need some help in the digestion department, have an upset stomach, or just need something cozy when it’s cold outside.

","To a small saucepan, add turmeric, ginger, lemon juice and leftover lemon rind, maple syrup (optional), cayenne (optional), and filtered water.

Then turn off heat.Set a small strainer over serving glasses and divide between two mugs. Enjoy. If the tonic is too potent for you, dilute with more hot/warm water.Store (strained) leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Reheat on the stovetop until just warm."

This soup is amazing, friends! One sample bite in and I believe I started talking to myself about how delicious it was, which was really confusing for everyone in the room. In other words, this is talk-to-yourself-it’s-so-good soup.
Plus, it’s simple! Just 1 pot and about 30 minutes required.


The base for this soup is a mixture of late summer vegetables, vegetable broth, and fire-roasted tomatoes. Then comes beans and gluten-free pasta for a bit of fiber and plant-based protein. And finally, greens! I went with a handful of spinach, but kale would be lovely here, too.

172,Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Zucchini Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Chocolate Zucchini Bread

It’s here! The chocolaty, rich, naturally sweet, tender zucchini bread of my dreams. Have I convinced you of how delicious this is yet? Let me show you how!

This recipe is incredibly easy to make, requiring just 1 bowl and simple, wholesome ingredients.
The base is a blend of flax eggs, coconut oil, zucchini, and applesauce, while maple syrup and coconut sugar add the perfect amount of natural sweetness. Then comes plenty of cocoa powder for that rich chocolate flavor.

For gluten-free flours, I tested many combinations, but a mixture of oat flour, gluten-free flour, and almond flour worked best! It created a fluffy, tender zucchini bread that was moist but not at all gummy in the center.

Once your bread has baked, it’s important to let it cool all the way. I know! It’s tough. But the longer this bread cools, the fluffier and more tender it becomes.

I hope you all LOVE this zucchini bread! It’s:
Wholesome
Naturally sweetened
Chocolaty
Fluffy
Tender

This would make the perfect breakfast (pair it with coconut butter or coconut yogurt!), snack, or healthier dessert. I even enjoyed mine with a bit of creamy peanut butter for a bit more protein. Serious yum.

Then carefully lift onto a cooling rack using the parchment paper. Texture is best when cooled completely. Will keep covered at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
173,Easy Vegan Poutine | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Poutine

After many requests for vegan poutine, it’s finally here! Without further ado, let’s jump into it!
This recipe requires 10 ingredients and about 1 hour to prepare (once your cheese is made!).
The base, of course, is crispy baked fries! I discovered that cooking the fries in a bit of oil on parchment paper allowed them to get crispy on the outside and tender on the inside without ever sticking to the pan.

While your fries cook, it’s gravy time. For my gravy, I went with a mix of mushroom and shallot for flavor and heartiness, cornstarch or arrowroot to thicken, almond milk and vegetable stock to thin and add more flavor, and plenty of salt, pepper, and a dash of vinegar and coconut aminos to bring more depth of flavor.
I did a lot of testing and research when it came to gravy, and this by far was my favorite! I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

All that’s left to do is add cheese, brown in the oven, and top with gravy!
Traditional poutine doesn’t require the cheese curd to be cooked, but my version isn’t traditional – it’s vegan, after all. Plus, the Vegan Mozzarella Cheese “curds” taste best when they’ve got a little a little color on them! And who wouldn’t want melty, gooey cheese on their fries?

I hope you all LOVE these fries! They’re:
Hearty
Salty
Cheese
Gravy-covered
Savory
Luscious
&amp; SO Satisfying
This is the perfect dish to enjoy on game days, on chilly fall and winter evenings, or when you’re craving a hearty appetizer or snack. I think these puppies are delicious on their own, but they would also pair well with a cold beer or white wine sangria (obviously), my Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, Easy Grillable Veggie Burger, orVegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich.

","FRIES: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C) and chop potatoes into thin slices by halving lengthwise then cutting into wedges and then strips. For “wedges,” cut into larger pieces - both work the same, but matchsticks cook faster.Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper (amount as original recipe is written // use fewer or more pans if altering batch size). Add fries, oil (see notes for substitution), and salt and toss to coat. Then arrange fries in a single layer, making sure they aren’t overlapping too much. This will help them crisp up and cook evenly.Bake for a total of 25-35 minutes, tossing/flipping at least once to ensure even baking. When the fries are finished, remove from oven and set aside.GRAVY: While fries are baking, prepare gravy by heating a rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and shallots. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add mushrooms, salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, and coconut aminos (optional).Stir and increase heat to medium high to brown the mushrooms. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until they are slightly caramelized. Then add the cornstarch and stir to coat. It should look dry at this point - that’s OK.Lower heat to low and slowly add the broth and almond milk while whisking. It should resemble gravy pretty quickly and should bubble and thicken as it cooks.Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until you've reached the desired consistency. Add broth or almond milk to thin if it becomes too thick.Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth (optional but recommended). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt and pepper to taste or more Worcestershire or coconut aminos for more depth of flavor. See notes for other additions if you desire more depth of flavor.Return gravy to stovetop and heat on lowest heat to keep warm.FOR SERVING: Add all of the baked fries to one baking sheet. Then divide the Vegan Mozzarella Cheese into 1 tsp ""curds"" and add to the baked fries (I used just shy of 1 batch of the recipe). Then place fries back in oven on the top rack on medium-to-low broil so the cheese can melt and get slightly browned. Watch carefully so the fries don't burn - 3-5 minutes.Pour the gravy over top and dig in! This is a dish best enjoyed fresh! However, the cheese will store separately in the fridge up to 10 days (see notes for other uses). The gravy will keep in the refrigerator up to 5 days (reheat on stovetop for best results - add more almond milk or broth to thin if thickened), and the fries will store for 2-3 days (reheat in oven at 350 degrees F (176 C) for best results)."
174,Vegan Mozzarella Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Mozzarella “Cheese”

It’s cheese! It’s cheese! And it’s seriously easy to make! Shall we?

This is my take on vegan “mozzarella cheese.” There are quite a few methods out there to try, but to me, this is about as easy (and delicious) as it gets, requiring just 7 ingredients and simple methods to create.
The base for this “cheese” is soaked cashews. They get wonderfully creamy when soaked and create a neutral flavor base that takes on the tanginess of coconut yogurt, lemon, and nutritional yeast so well.

Once blended, all you have to do is cook on the stovetop for about 5-10 minutes, first whisking and then stirring until you get a thick, sticky cheese ball!

At this point, the cheese is ready to use. But to add a bit more flavor to the mozz, you can soak it in a sea salt water brine. I personally thought this was a fun approach, but ultimately, I felt that it added too much moisture to my cheese, so in the instructions, I recommend skipping. But you can see the process photographed below.

What is this cheese good for? SO MANY THINGS.
I loved it on top of pizza, as it got all melty, browned, and gooey. But you could also add it to tomatoes, pesto sandwiches, pasta dishes like baked lasagna, Caprese salads, and so much more!

I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Cheesy
Stringy
Gooey
Melty
Easy to make
&amp; Incredibly delicious!
Keep this cheese on hand when you need a cheesy topping for pizza, pasta, “meatballs,”salads, and more! I do have a vegan version of poutine coming up, which I specifically designed this recipe for, so stay tuned!

","Soak cashews in very hot water for 1 hour or overnight or at least 6 hours in cool water. Drain thoroughly.Add cashews to a high-speed blender, along with coconut yogurt (see notes for substitutions), lemon juice, almond or rice milk, salt, nutritional yeast, and tapioca starch, and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesiness, salt for saltiness, lemon juice for acidity, or coconut yogurt for more creaminess or tang. The texture should be creamy, smooth, and pourable.Transfer to a small saucepan or skillet, heat over medium-low heat, and begin whisking. It should start to bubble and thicken and look a little clumpy - this is OK. Keep whisking and the mixture will come together in a ball-like shape within 4-5 minutes. Lower heat if cooking too quickly. It’s also normal for the cheese to stick to the bottom of the pan a little. Don’t panic.Lower heat to the lowest setting and switch to a wooden mixing spoon. Continue stirring until a loose “ball” is formed (see photo). Then transfer to a small mixing bowl.At this point, it’s cheese that’s ready to be used! I prefer covering, letting it cool in the refrigerator, and then scooping into 1 Tbsp amounts for “curds” or 3 Tbsp amounts for “mozzarella-like balls.”Optional: Make a salt water brine by adding 1 1/2 Tbsp sea salt to 2 cups (480 ml) hot water and stirring to dissolve. Then add plenty of ice to chill. Add your mozzarella balls or curds to the bath to add a bit more salty flavor. However, I found that this caused the cheese to take on more liquid and become too moist, so I’d personally recommend skipping this step."
175,Traditional White Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Traditional White Sangria

Friends!
Summer is almost over here in the Pacific Northwest, but I’m still hanging on to every last drop of sunshine with this Traditional White Wine Sangria. Gather your leftover berries and stone fruit, snag an apple and some wine, and let’s make sangria!

I shared a recipe for Easy Traditional Red Sangria, and you all have loved that! It’s our go-to for hosting and one we enjoy over and over again. So it was due time to create a white wine version.
This recipe is simple, requiring just 8 ingredients, 1 pitcher, and 15 minutes to make. The only “special” ingredients it requires are a bottle of white Spanish table wine and apple brandy (brand recommendations included below!). Based on my research, this is a traditional blend of alcohol and wine that creates a crisp but boozy and irresistible sangria.

For fruit, I went with plenty of citrus, strawberry, nectarine, and apple. Of course, based on whatever season it is in your country, get creative! Anything that blends well with beverages would likely work here (think oranges, blackberries, figs, plums, and mango).
Sangria benefits from a bit of sweetness, and to keep things uncomplicated and pure in flavor, I went with organic cane sugar. But I know some of you avoid sugar, so try sweetening with a comparable amount of either powdered coconut sugar, maple syrup, agave, or stevia to taste.

All that’s left to do is muddle and then add the rest of the fruit and booze! This is the fun part.

Simply stir and serve over ice or frozen fruit. This can be made up to 24 hours in advance, which makes it ideal for making ahead for parties and gatherings.

I hope you all LOVE this sangria! It’s:
Citrusy Bright Fruity Perfectly sweet Refreshing Versatile &amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect easy beverage for Spanish-inspired mealsor tapas dishes like Patatas Bravas (mmmm, take me back to Spain already).
Pair this delicious sangria with just about anything spicy or Spanish/Mexican-inspired, like Quinoa &amp; Vegetable Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms, Roasted Cauliflower Tacos with Chipotle Romesco, Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, Quinoa Taco Meat, or Butternut Squash Portobello Tacos!

","Add lime, lemon, and sugar (or other sweeteners) to a large pitcher (or use multiple pitchers if making a larger batch) and muddle with a muddler or wooden spoon for 45 seconds.Add apple brandy and muddle again to combine for 30 seconds. Add apple, nectarine, and strawberries and stir to incorporate. Then add wine and stir once more.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener of choice for sweetness, lemon or lime juice for acidity, or fruit. Stir to combine.Add ice or frozen berries and stir once more to chill. Serve as is or with a bit more ice and mint (optional). To dilute the mixture, top off glasses with a bit of sparkling water (optional).Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, though best when enjoyed within the first 1-2 days."
176,Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower Steak | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower “Steak”

I’ve been wanting to share a cauliflower steak for the longest time, and my beloved version is finally here!
If you’ve never had cauliflower “steak,” it’s exactly what it sounds like: cauliflower sliced lengthwise into “steaks,” seasoned, and either grilled or roasted (I went for roasted) until tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Swoon!

My take is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to prepare, which includes my go-to green chutney sauce!
For seasoning the cauliflower, I went with my DIY Shawarma Spice Blend, which creates a smoky, subtly spicy coating that pairs perfectly with the chutney.

The end result is PERFECT! It’s:
Smoky
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Served with a citrusy, herby sauce
Hearty
Satisfying
&amp; Incredibly healthy!
I love this either as a hearty side or served atop a bed of quinoa for more protein (see recipe + notes for more options!)! It could also pair especially well with my Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, or Chickpea Shawarma Dip!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and slice your cauliflower into 1-inch “steaks,” leaving the large stem at the bottom so it helps the “steaks” hold together.Place on a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet and rub the ""steaks"" with oil (or water), sea salt, maple syrup, and shawarma spice blend to evenly coat. Be gentle, as the cauliflower steaks can break apart, which is no big deal (but it's ideal if they remain in one solid piece).Bake for 20-25 minutes total, flipping carefully once at the halfway point to ensure even browning on both sides, or until tender and browned.In the meantime, prepare the chutney by adding all ingredients (besides water // avocado is optional) to a food processor or high-speed blender and blend on high to combine, scraping down sides as needed. Then add water until a creamy sauce is formed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, salt for overall flavor, garlic for kick, or lime for acidity. Add to a serving dish (store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 4-5 days).Serve by plating cauliflower and drizzling with chutney sauce. This makes a generous side dish, or to make this a more complete meal, serve over a bed of quinoa, alongside beans or hummus, or with roasted vegetables and tahini (like this salad).Store leftover cauliflower steaks in the refrigerator up to 2 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a hot skillet on the stovetop or in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven."

The matcha comes in swirl form. Once most of the filling has been added, add a bit of matcha to the remaining filling and blend.
Then pour and swirl. Ohhhh, yeah. It’s not only beautiful, but also delicious.


I love using matcha in recipes because it boasts some serious health benefits! It contains an amazing amount of antioxidants. And it provides a gentler boost of caffeine. Find links to my two favorite brands below (one more expensive, one more affordable).
Plus, that color! I’d use it for the color alone. Swoon!

Creamy
Rich
Matcha-infused
Naturally sweetened
Protein-packed
A healthier dessert
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect dessert for hosting or bringing along to parties. People would never guess it’s vegan and gluten-free! It’s also raw, refined-sugar-free, and super easy to make!

","Add cashews to a bowl, cover with very hot water, and let soak 1 hour. Or cover with cool water and let soak for 6-8 hours or overnight. Drain well and set aside.Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Next, add nuts and salt and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more chopped walnuts.Line a standard pie, round cake dish, or 7-inch springform pan (I like this one!) with parchment paper (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Then add crust mixture and carefully press with fingers to distribute.To pack it down, use a flat-edged drinking glass lined with parchment paper and really press it down, pushing some crust up the sides. Place in the freezer to firm up.Add all filling ingredients except matcha to a high-speed blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. If it has trouble blending, add a bit more coconut milk.Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed, adding more coconut yogurt or lemon juice for tang, maple syrup for sweetness, or vanilla for vanilla flavor.Pour 2/3 filling into the crust (see photo) and tap a few times to release any air bubbles. Set aside.To the remaining filling, add the matcha powder, starting with the lesser end of the range (1 1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). Blend until creamy and smooth. Then taste and see if it needs more matcha. I found 1 1/2 to be the perfect amount, as too much can taste bitter. Add to the filling in a swirling motion. Then swirl a few times with a spoon or a chopstick to create more of a swirl. Tap on the counter to release any air bubbles.Cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze until set - about 3-4 hours depending on size of dish. When set, it will be firm to the touch.To serve, set out of the freezer until slightly soft to the touch - about 15-20 minutes. Then slice with a hot knife for easier slicing. Top with a touch of coconut whipped cream and fresh berries, or enjoy as is!Once this cheesecake has been frozen, it can be stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days, but it will become quite soft. For this reason, I recommend storing it in the freezer and setting out for 15-20 minutes before slicing/serving to enjoy the best texture.

It’s time for another easy, plant-based meal that’s flavorful, healthy, and super delicious. Let’s do this!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare!
And it’s inspired by an Indian dish called aloo gobi, which typically consists of curried cauliflower and potatoes. While it can be served on its own, I prefer this more saucy inspired version*. Serious yum.
In place of regular potatoes I went with sweet because sweet potato’s flavor lends itself so well to curry! And instead of cooking the cauliflower with the sweet potatoes, I roasted them with sea salt and curry powder until crispy and golden brown. I find roasted cauliflower to have so much more flavor and such better texture than stewed. Plus, once roasted, it acts as the “rice” in this dish to soak up all of that delicious curry sauce.

For serving, you don’t need much more than some fresh cilantro and lemon juice!
This curry also pairs well with my Vegan Naan if you’re looking for even more heartiness. Or just some classic rice or cauliflower rice would be delicious, too!

I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Flavorful
Hearty
Vegetable-packed
Comforting
Satisfying
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something fresh and hearty on the table fast! It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with this Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri, Curry Roasted Vegetable and Lentil Kale Salad, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, andCurry-Spiced Cashews.

*Update: Some readers commented that aloo gobi traditionally does not include tomatoes or curry paste, which was a new-to-me idea! I based this recipe off a version I tried in an Indian restaurant that did include tomatoes and tasted very similar to this dish. This is definitely an inspired version! I tend to keep curry paste on hand, which is why I recommended using it in this recipe. However, to keep it more traditional you can instead season with spices (such as turmeric and garam masala) and fresh chilies.
","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or more baking sheets if increasing batch size). Add cauliflower and season with oil (or water), curry powder, and sea salt.Toss to combine and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and slightly crispy on the edges. Set aside.In the meantime, heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add water or oil, shallot, ginger, and garlic. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.Add curry paste and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Then add sweet potatoes, curry powder, and salt. Stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes uncovered.Add tomatoes, coconut milk, and coconut sugar and stir to combine. Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a very low boil. Then reduce heat to low or medium low (until simmering). Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally.In the last minutes of cooking, add lemon juice and stir. Then taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, curry powder or paste for intense curry flavor, coconut sugar for sweetness, or more lemon juice for acidity.Remove lid and turn heat off so the mixture can thicken slightly. To serve, divide roasted cauliflower between serving plates and top with desired amount of curry. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish. This dish is great on its own, but it's also delicious with rice, cauliflower rice, or vegan naan.Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop over medium heat (or in the microwave) until hot and bubbly. Cauliflower and curry can be stored together."

So, when I recently ran out of bananas but was still craving a smoothie, I discovered this recipe, which would be perfect for those of you who aren’t in love with bananas but still want a delicious, creamy smoothie.
Let’s do this!

This recipe requires just 6 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes– simple, just the way I like it.
Instead of bananas for a creamy, sweet base, I relied on another favorite: mango!
And for a gorgeous pink hue and dose of antioxidants, I added in a mixture of strawberries and raspberries. Frozen fruit makes the creamiest, dreamiest smoothies. But if yours is fresh, simply add 1-2 cups of ice to chill things down.
Next up are lime for some acidity, ginger for a bit of spice, coconut milk and shredded coconut for a bit of coconut flavor, and a pinch of cayenne to bring a bit of heat (optional but recommended!).

Mmm, look at that creamy goodness. All that’s left to do is enjoy as is or layer and garnish with delicious toppings!
I went for my Easy 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt, but full-fat coconut milk works wonders as well for that sultry swirl effect. And on top, I went with more raspberries, a bit of lime, and a spoonful of coconut flakes. Yes, please.
I hope you all LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Citrusy
Naturally sweet
Gingery + subtly spicy
Nutrient-packed

186,Gluten-Free Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies

Hey, friends! How’s it going?
Things are swimming along over here. Summer is in full bloom (my fave), we’ve been traveling a lot, and I’ve been enjoying being in the kitchen even more than usual lately for some weird but wonderful reason.
Maybe it’s because I’ve been whipping up delicious eats like these healthier oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Let’s bake!

The base for this simple, 10-ingredient recipe is oats, almond flour (or meal), and shredded coconut. Coconut oil adds moisture and crispness, while almond butter adds nuttiness and helps create a tender center.
Lastly, they’re sweetened with muscovado sugar (or coconut or brown sugar) and studded with vegan dark chocolate chips. Swoon.

The binder is aquafaba (method adapted from these Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies!), which helps the cookies puff up and crisp on the edges. Is there anything aquafaba can’t do? I think not.

Just 12-15 minutes in the oven and these babies are ready to go. You can make the dough ahead of time and chill overnight or even scoop out and freeze for future late-night cookie cravings (raise your hand if this happens to you way too often).

I hope you all LOVE cookies! They’re:
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Packed with oats
Studded with chocolate
Healthier than your average cookie
&amp; SO delicious
These would make the perfect cookie to have around to snack on throughout the week. If I were you, I’d throw them (already baked) into the freezer to have a cold, crunchy cookie when your sweet tooth craving strikes. (Trust me, I’m an expert – frozen cookies are where it’s at).

","In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond flour, oats, coconut, vegan chocolate, baking powder, salt, and sugar.In a separate bowl, beat aquafaba (using a handheld mixer or by whisking vigorously) until light and fluffy and loose peaks have formed. (Add a little cream of tartar to help them along if not whipping.)To the aquafaba, add the almond butter, oil, and vanilla (optional) and beat or whisk to combine. (The mixture will deflate a little - that's OK). Then add to dry ingredients and mix until combined. You should have a firm, semi-tacky dough (see photo). Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or overnight.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and either lightly grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Scoop chilled dough into roughly 2-Tablespoon amounts (I like this scoop) and form into small discs (see photo). Place on baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap in between each cookie to allow for spreading. There should be about 12 cookies.Bake for 10 minutes. Then increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 C) and bake for another 2-4 minutes or until the edges are slightly golden brown. Be careful not to burn (especially on the bottoms) - they bake quickly toward the end.Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Then carefully loosen with a spatula - they can stick a little to the bare pan.Store leftovers in a loosely sealed container at room temperature up to 3 days, in the refrigerator for 4 days, or in the freezer for 1 month. These are so delicious when warm and dipped in almond milk or hot cocoa! I recommend storing them in the freezer once cooked to help retain their crispy exterior."
187,Quinoa & Vegetable Stuffed Mushrooms | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa &amp; Vegetable Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms

It’s stuffed mushroom time! This summer-friendly recipe is yet another grill-friendly meal that’s portable, versatile, and super delicious.

It’s not only tasty, it’s also easy to make, requiring just 30 minutes and simple methods.
The base is hearty portobello mushrooms in a balsamic-lime marinade seasoned with smoky spices. You can cook them eitherin the oven or on the grill, which makes them great for taking along to BBQs and dinner parties alike.

The “stuffing” is comprised of cooked quinoa, black beans, sweet potatoes, bell pepper, and cabbage seasoned with salt, lime, and smoky spices.
Once your mushrooms have marinated and been sautéed, they’re ready for the stuffing! Party time.


While your mushrooms finish in the oven or on the grill, you can prepare a sauce of choice, such as Easy Red Salsa, Easy Chimichurri Sauce, or Chipotle Red Salsa.
This is optional, but it takes the recipe to the next level! I personally prefer the chimichurri for its vibrant color and big flavor. It complements the dish perfectly.

I hope you guys love this dish! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Satisfying
Healthy
Versatile
BBQ-friendly
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect plant-based entrée for dinner parties and BBQs! I think it would satisfy vegans and non-vegans alike, and it can be customized to be grain-free andinclude several different sauces (options below).
While they’re delicious on their own, they would also be delicious paired with my Plantain Chips + Garlicky Guacamole, Roasted Sweet Potato Avocado Salad, Raw-Maine Taco Boats, Grilled Veggie Skewers, and Kale Chip Nachos!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and set out a rimmed baking sheet or a large baking dish. (Or, if grilling, heat grill.)If you don't have any cooked quinoa on hand, start by heating a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add avocado oil or coconut oil or water (1 tsp as original recipe is written) and rinsed and drained quinoa (1/2 cup as original recipe is written). Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to toast. Then add 1 cup water and a pinch of salt (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Then reduce heat to simmer and cook until liquid has mostly absorbed and the quinoa is tender (~15-18 minutes). Drain off any excess liquid if needed. Then set off the heat uncovered to let any excess moisture evaporate.In the meantime, add mushrooms to a shallow baking or serving dish and season with oil (or water or vegetable broth), balsamic vinegar, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, and sea salt. Flip/toss to combine and set aside to let marinate.Next, prepare vegetables by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil or water (1 Tbsp (15 ml) as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), sweet potatoes, and bell pepper. Sauté for 3-5 minutes (covered) or until slightly browned, stirring occasionally.Add cabbage, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and 1/4 tsp sea salt (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and sauté for another 3-5 minutes or until all vegetables (especially potato) are tender and slightly golden brown. Set aside.Transfer vegetables from skillet to a large mixing bowl and set aside. Then, to the same skillet over medium heat, add the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes on both sides to brown and soften. Cover to lightly steam for the final minute. Then transfer to a baking sheet face up and set aside.To the mixing bowl with the vegetables, add cooked quinoa, drained black beans, remaining 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp sea salt (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and lime juice and toss to combine.Divide the filling between the mushrooms (some may overflow - that's fine). Bake at 400 degrees (or on the grill, covered) for about 5 minutes or until mushrooms and toppings are hot and slightly browned.Enjoy immediately as is or with a sauce of choice (optional // I think the chimichurri goes awesome with this recipe!). Store leftovers separate from sauce(s) and covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven or the microwave until hot."
188,Best Vegan Matcha Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Best Vegan Matcha Latte

Matcha lattes, you guys. Vegan matcha lattes. Naturally sweetened vegan matcha lattes. Things are getting very hipster over here today and I’m very into it.
Let’s matcha!

I’ve been on and off the caffeine train many times over the last decade. Some days, it’s my superpower. Other days, it makes me feel like an insane person.
So when I’m needing a little pick-me-up these days, I’ve been opting for a gentler source of caffeine that also boasts a flurry of antioxidants: matcha green tea powder!

This 4-ingredient, 5-minute recipe is easy to make, customizable, and super delicious. The first and most important thing is to start with quality matcha.
Townshend’s is local to Portland and I love supporting local brands doing cool things, so I went with Townshend’s this time (which happens to be bright green and so delicious!).
However, if you’re new to matcha and wanting to try a more affordable yet still high-quality brand, tryOrganic Matcha (which I also enjoyed).

For sweetener, I went with maple syrup, but another natural alternative would be stevia, which dissolves easily and adds a subtle amount of sweetness to your latte.
The next important ingredient is dairy-free milk. I tested almond, coconut, and macadamia nut milk, and two stood out as clear winners.
Almond milk doesn’t jive with the flavor of matcha in my opinion, but coconut and macadamia, on the other hand, totally do.
I found my favorite combo to be half coconut milk, half macadamia milk (brand recommendations below // see my Guide to Making Dairy-Free Milks here!). This duo creates a creamy, delicious latte that lets the matcha shine through.

I hope you guys enjoy this latte! It’s:
Creamy
Smooth
Bright green
Naturally sweetened
Antioxidant-rich
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect gentle caffeine boost when you need a little pick-me-up. I enjoy mine warm in the morning with breakfast. But it can also be made cold over ice if you’re in warmer climates or it’s summertime.
If you’re into caffeine boosts, also be sure to check out our Cold Brew Mocha Frappuccino, Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino, Coffee Coconut Ice Cream, Vegan Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches, Vegan Pumpkin Spice Latte Waffles, 3-Ingredient Mocha Milkshake, and Matcha Green Smoothie Bowls.

","Add matcha powder to your serving mug along with sweetener of choice and hot water. (If adding add-ins like maca, ashwaganda, or coconut butter, add at this time.)Whisk with a bamboo whisk or a metal whisk until completely dissolved. If you don't have a bamboo whisk, you can use a spoon or a metal whisk or even blend the latte in a blender. Bamboo whisks are gentle on the matcha and also help it dissolve more completely. So if you like matcha, I recommend investing! Otherwise, use what you have.Once the matcha is completely dissolved, heat* your coconut and macadamia milk (or other dairy-free milks). I added mine to a frothing pitcher and steamed on our espresso machine, but you could also heat in the microwave or on the stovetop until hot and steamy. To get more froth, you can whisk vigorously or use a handheld frother.Pour dairy-free milk into your mug - latte art optional (mine was a little sad - lol). Taste and add more sweetener if needed. I found that, when I used the macadamia nut milk, I only needed a bit of maple syrup or stevia to sweeten. Enjoy immediately."
189,Roasted Rainbow Vegetable Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Rainbow Vegetable Bowl (30 Minutes!)

I shared on Instagram stories recently about a meal I’ve been super into that has a surprising amount of protein despite it being basically 100% vegetables.
Yeah, vegetables are cool like that, bro. Let me show you how!

This 30-minute vegetable bowl is inspired by farmers market produce and the beautiful CSA we’ve been getting this year! I’ve found myself in an abundance of vegetables and loving it – but not always knowing what to do with them.
My easy solution? Roasting. Roasting vegetables makes them easier to digest, enhances their flavor, and takes them to whole new level of delicious. So we start with carrots, beets, radish, potatoes, and sweet potatoes all tossed in sea salt, oil (or water), and curry powder.

Once the root vegetables are 10 minutes in, throw in some cabbage, bell pepper, broccolini, and, last but not least, some greens! And just like that, you have a meal.

So where does the protein come from? Plants! Vegetables have plenty of protein (and other healthy stuff like fiber, vitamins, and minerals).
For instance, did you know 1 potato has 4.3 grams protein,
1 cup kale has nearly 3 grams protein, and
1 cup broccoli has 2.6 grams protein?
And fun fact:1 head cauliflower has 11 grams protein!
Kinda cool, right? Throw on some hemp seeds and tahini and your meal boasts 13.2 grams protein!
Don’t get me wrong – it’s not all about protein. There are many studies that suggest average protein consumption is usually too high. But people often wonder where plant-based eaters get their protein. And I personally love knowing I’m getting plenty just from simple plant sources.

I hope you all LOVE this bowl! It’s:
Wholesome
Satisfying
Colorful
Flavorful
Healthy
Versatile
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect healthy plant-based breakfast, lunch, or dinner! I’ve been loving mine as a late morning brunch alongside a little Golden Milk or lemon water. If you aren’t into tahini, try my Easy 10-Minute Chimichurri Sauceor Garlic Dill Sauce!
And if you’re into simple, wholesome meals, be sure to check out our Baked Sweet Potatoes 2 Ways, Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri, Roasted Sweet Potato &amp; Avocado Green Salad, Raw-Maine Taco Boats, and Grain-Free Tabbouleh Salad(add some crispy baked chickpeas for a meal!).

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or more baking sheets if increasing batch size).To one baking sheet, add the potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and radishes and drizzle with half of the oil (or water), curry powder, and sea salt (as original recipe is written- 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil (or water), 1/2 tsp curry powder, and 1/4 tsp sea salt). Toss to combine. Bake for a total of 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and tender.To the second baking sheet, add the cabbage, bell pepper, and broccolini. Drizzle with with the remaining half of the oil (or water), curry powder, and sea salt (as original recipe is written- 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil (or water), 1/2 tsp curry powder, and 1/4 tsp sea salt). Toss to combine.When the potatoes/carrots hit the 10-minute mark, add the second pan to the oven and bake for a total of 15-20 minutes. In the last 5 minutes of baking, add the collard greens or kale to either pan and roast until tender and bright green.To serve, divide vegetables between serving plates and garnish with avocado (optional) and season with lemon juice, tahini, hemp seeds, and another pinch of sea salt (optional). You could also garnish with any fresh herbs you have!Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.

191,Garlicky Alfredo Sweet Potato Noodles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta (8 Ingredients)

Friends, are you ready for some next-level alfredo pasta? I know – who isn’t? Let’s do this!

The base and inspiration for this recipe is sweet potato noodles!
I’ve only shared a few veggie noodle pastas on the blog (Carrot Noodle Chickpea Bolognese,Zucchini Pasta with Lentil Sauce and Noodle-Free Pad Thai). But, because it’s summer and I’ve found myself in an abundance of zucchini and potatoes, it seemed like the right time to share another “pasta-free” pasta dish!

This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 8 ingredientsand simple methods to prepare.
The base is spiralized sweet potato noodles, which cook up quickly until tender and provide the perfect amount of sweetness to offset the garlicky, cheesy cashew alfredo sauce.
This garlicky alfredo sauce is on point! Cashews blend with garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and almond milk. Arrowroot adds a little more thickness to the sauce but isn’t necessary.
Yes, that’s it! So easy and so creamy, garlicky, and delicious. Look at that thickness though!

I hope you all LOVE this veggie noodle pasta. It’s:
Garlicky
Creamy
Savory-sweet
Satisfying
Versatile
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something healthy but satisfying.

*Recipe updated 6/6/18 to speed cook time and improve method for cooking sweet potatoes!
","Add cashews to a small mixing bowl and cover with very hot water to soak for 30 minutes. Then drain thoroughly and set aside. (Or soak cashews overnight or 6-8 hours in cool water).If serving with kale chips or sautéed kale (or crispy chickpeas), prepare now and set aside until serving.While cashews finish soaking, peel and spiralize potatoes using a veggie spiralizer on the thinnest blade. Or if you don't own a spiralizer, you can use a vegetable peeler or julienne peeler instead. Set aside.Add soaked and drained cashews to a high-speed blender. Then add remaining ingredients: garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, arrowroot starch, and almond or rice milk.Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic for zing/kick, nutritional yeast for ""cheesiness,"" salt for saltiness, or a pinch of red pepper flake (optional) for heat. The sauce should be creamy, smooth, and pourable. If too thick, thin with a bit more almond milk.Transfer sauce to a large, rimmed pan or pot and heat over medium-low heat until it just starts to bubble. Whisk as it heats, as it will thicken. Once bubbling reduce heat to a very low simmer to keep warm. The sauce will thicken, so thin with more almond or rice milk as needed.Add 1 inch water to a large pot and top with a steamer basket (if you don't have a steamer basket, see notes). Heat over medium-high heat and once bubbling, add potato noodles. Cover to let steam for 3-5 minutes or until al dente or a little softer (depending on taste). Be careful not to steam too long or the noodles can become soggy. Add your sweet potatoes to your sauce and gently toss to combine. If adding kale or other add-ins, add at this time.Serve as is or garnish with fresh parsley, crispy chickpeas, kale, vegan parmesan, or red pepper flake (optional).This dish is best when fresh, as the noodles tend to get soggy after reheating, but the flavor is still delicious! If storing for later, I recommend keeping kale and other toppings separate. Will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or microwave."
192,Peanut Butter & Jelly Açaí Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Açaí Bowls

On a recent trip to Kansas to visit friends and family, we stopped at a local juice shop called Songbird that had the delicious, healthy offerings I was craving when away from home.
Are you surprised to know I went two days in a row? And that I ordered the same thing both days? I’m so predictable it’s not even funny.
This was one of my first açaí bowl experiences, and the flavor combination of banana peanut butter finally compelled me to create an inspired version for the blog. Let’s do this!

This recipe is SO simple, requiring just 10 minutes, 4 ingredients, and 1 blender.
The base is açaí, the wonder fruit everyone seems to be raving about, especially when it comes to smoothie bowls.
Açaí is a South American-based berry that’s becoming quite popular in the health community, boasting loads of antioxidants, amino acids, electrolytes, and vitamins.
I personally love it because (depending on the brand you buy – I like Sambazon), it has very low sugar content. Plus, itblends extremely well with other ingredients as it’s quite neutral in flavor, which is what makes it perfect for this banana peanut butter version!

In addition to frozen açaí (which is easy to find at most grocery stores and health markets in the frozen section), I relied on bananas for creamy sweetness, peanut butter powder for a lower-calorie yet high-protein addition, coconut milk, and spinach (hello, fiber and folate).
The result is a creamy, thick smoothie bowl that ends up tasting like a banana peanut butter milkshake!

For toppings, I went with sliced bananas, berries, coconut, and sunflower seeds. Hemp seeds also make a great addition.
I also think this smoothie bowl would be delicious with the addition of your favorite vegan protein powder (chocolate, vanilla, or plain)!

I hope you all LOVE this smoothie bowl! It’s:
Creamy
Perfectly sweet
Peanut buttery
Nutritious
Super healthy
&amp; Mega delicious
This would make the perfect breakfast or snack for days when you don’t have much time or it’s too hot to cook.

","Add frozen acai, frozen banana, peanut butter powder (or butter), and the lesser amount of dairy-free milk (1/4 cup as original recipe is written) to a high-speed blender. If adding spinach, add at this time. I only added berries for purple color and recommend leaving them out for best flavor.Blend on low, using a wand to push the fruit down. Smoothie bowls will be thick, so it takes them longer to blend. Continue blending, scraping down sides as needed, adding only as much dairy-free milk as it takes to help it form a thick smoothie texture.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more peanut butter powder (or butter) for peanut butter flavor, banana for sweetness, or berries for fruity flavor. The flavor should resemble a peanut butter banana smoothie, as the açaí is quite subtle in flavor and slightly tart.Divide between two serving bowls and garnish with desired toppings. I went with coconut, berries, banana, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, and peanut butter.Enjoy immediately - best when fresh! Freeze leftovers up to 2 weeks. Thaw to enjoy."
193,Chia Egg Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make a Chia Egg

What’s a chia egg?
If you’re looking to get into vegan baking, you should know what a chia egg is and how to use it!
It’s simple – just 1 Tbsp chia seeds + 2.5 Tbsp water = a chia egg. But then what? So many uses!

You can use a chia egg (or flax egg) as an egg substitute in many dishes, like quick breads, waffles, cookies, and more!

","Add chia seeds to a small dish and top with water. Stir and let rest for 5 minute to thicken. It should be gel-like and thick.It's not an exact 1:1 substitution in every recipe because it doesn't bind and stiffen during baking quite like an egg does. But, similar to a flax egg, it works well in pancakes, quick breads, muffins, cookies, and many other baked recipes. Chia seeds also make a delicious chia pudding, like this Chocolate Chia Pudding and PB&J Chia Pudding!"

I am writing this post as I’m en route to Kansas City to finish up some work projects and to visit family.
We’ve found ourselves traveling a lot recently between our new home state of Oregon and our former home state Kansas. Sometimes I can’t make up my mind if I’m an Oregonian or a Kansan. I decided this morning I can be both.
Life has been good lately. I’ve started a personal Instagram account (@danainreallife) to share more about things outside of food (like travel, marriage, and natural beauty). So if you’re wanting more behind-the-scenes peeks at our everyday life, you can follow along there.
Otherwise, keep it parked here for a serious dose of plant-based goodness, like these Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Chocolate Chip Pancakes!

This recipe is inspired by and adapted from my Life-Changing Banana Walnut Pancakes! Only this time, I went all in with a double dose of chocolate: cocoa-infused batter speckled with semisweet chocolate chips! Serious swoon.
In just 20 minutes, you’ll have fluffy, tender, wholesome pancakesthat just happen to taste like chocolate cake on your hands. Does life get any better?

Now, for toppings? While these pancakes are delicious on their own, take them to the next level with things like maple syrup, chocolate chips, banana, and coconut butter! These would also be insane with peanut butter (tested and approved).

I hope you all LOVE these pancakes! They’re:
Fluffy

This recipe has been a long time coming.
While doing some experimentation with my diet in the winter, I really missed our weekly takeout order of Pad Thai. Due to some restrictions, I wasn’t able to have it, so I decided to make a version that was friendly to my gut while still tasting delicious.
Spoiler alert: This is my new favorite Pad Thai recipe that trumps takeout every time. It’s that good!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare!
And LOOK at all those veggies! Noodle-free Pad Thai never looked so gorgeous and delicious.
To replace traditional rice noodles, I went with carrot “noodles,” collard greens, thinly sliced bell pepper, and cabbage. Look at all those gorgeous plants you’re going to eat!
And let’s not forget the sauce, which I played around with quite a bit until perfecting: almond butter, lime juice, coconut aminos (or tamari / soy sauce), maple syrup, and chili flake. That’s it! So simple, savory, spicy, sweet, and insanely delicious.


For more “oomph,” I added a bit of crumbled tofu to mock the egg in traditional Pad Thai, but this is completely optional, especially if you’re soy-free. I even included some options below for those looking for soy-free protein sources!

I hope you all LOVE this healthier Pad Thai! It’s:

Savory-spicy-sweet
Super healthy
Satisfying

Then add Pad Thai sauce and freshly grated ginger and turmeric (optional).Sauté over medium heat until warmed through and collards are slightly wilted - about 3 minutes - stirring frequently.Taste and adjust flavor of dish as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, red pepper flake or chili garlic for heat, coconut aminos for saltiness, or lime juice for acidity.Divide between serving plates and enjoy. Serve as is or with peanut sauce, crushed peanuts, cilantro, and lime wedges. Serves 2 as an entrée or 4 as a side."
198,5-Ingredient Vegan Parmesan Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Parmesan Cheese

Nuts can be “cheese,” too, ya know?
I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again.
It was about time for my updated, go-to vegan parmesan cheeserecipe! Let’s do this.

What’s different about this new recipe and my old, go-to recipe? It’s cashew-free!
Many of you have expressed cashew allergies/intolerances and I thought I’d provide an alternative. This version is as easy as ever, requiring just 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, and 1 bowl.

In place of cashews, I went for a blend of hemp seeds, pine nuts (which add a buttery, nutty flavor), and Brazil nuts (which are fairly neutral in flavor).
The “cheese” flavor comes from nutritional yeast (which is super high in vitamin B12), and a pinch of salt. That’s it! Garlic powder and oil are optional, but they add even more depth of flavor.

I hope you all love this cashew-free vegan parmesan! It’s:
Cheesy
Savory
Nutty
Salty
Easy to make
Versatile
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect topper for things like Eggplant Parmesan, My Favorite Vegan Pizza, Roasted Red Pepper Pasta, or Easy Vegan Meatballs. It also works well in things like Pesto and Vegan Mac ‘n’ Cheese Sauces!

","Add brazil nuts, pine nuts, hemp seeds, nutritional yeast, and salt to a food processor or a blender and pulse into a fine meal. If adding garlic powder, add at this time. If adding garlic-infused oil, add after the mixture is a ""meal.""Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for “cheesiness” or salt for saltiness. Garlic powder adds more depth.Store in a covered container in the refrigerator up to 2-3 weeks (sometimes longer). Perfect for toppings things like pizza, pasta, lasagna, vegan meatballs, and more!"
199,Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri

This is an entrée salad if I’ve ever seen one. And it’s what I’ve been noshing on lately for solo-lady dinners and lunches at home.
It makes delicious use of seasonal vegetables, my favorite 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, and my 10-minute Chimichurri as a dressing! Wowza – that’s a gorgeous plate. Let’s make salad!

I’ve been digging roasted vegetables lately because they’re the easiest way to make vegetables tender, delicious,and easier to digest. And even with the roasting time, this remains a 30-minute recipe.
Some of you ask how I work so fast in the kitchen. I suppose I’ve been doing it for a while now, but also, I multitask! While your veggies are roasting, make your dressing. It’s that easy!
Lately, I’ve been throwing whatever roasted vegetables I have on a bed of greens and calling it a meal. Add a little tahini and lemon juice for “dressing.” Or, if you’re feeling fancy, bust out the chimichurri – my new favorite condiment for summer! Not only is it a gorgeous, vibrant green color, but it’s packed with healthy fats, spices, and an extra serving of greens from both parsley and cilantro.
Hello, world’s healthiest dressing (cue waving hand emoji).
I hope you guys LOVE this salad! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Veggie-packed
Satisfying
Super healthy
Versatile
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect meal for an easy at-home lunch or quick weeknight dinner. It travels well, so I could also see it being delicious on picnics, hikes, road trips, or even plane trips!
It’s hearty enough to serve two as an entrée (20+ grams protein!). But it would also make a delicious side to meals like my Grillable Veggie Burgers, Zucchini Lasagna, Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich, or Red Lentil Chili.

200,Vegan Gluten-Free Carrot Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Carrot Cake

Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me… Happy birthday to me!
Hey, guys. It’s my birthday and I made myself a cake, ’cause that’s how I do.
The wait is over – let’s make cake!

This cake is simple, requiring just 1 bowl to make! Plus, it requires basic ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
The recipe is adapted from my Vegan GF Carrot Apple Muffins, but it needed some tweaking to get that cake-like texture.
I tested this recipe for 3 days straight (oy) until I finally ended up with this perfected version. I served it to friends (non-vegan and non-gluten-free folks) and none of them could tell that it was special-diet friendly. Score!

The base of the cake is coconut oil, applesauce, flax eggs, maple syrup, and almond milk. Organic brown sugar and cane sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness while leaving the cake light and fluffy. And for gluten-free flours, I went with almond flour and my go-to gluten-free blend.
The result is a light, airy, fluffy carrot cake that retains its moisture without being mushy (the ultimate goal). Once cooled, it’s frosting time!


For frostings, I included several options. After taking a vote on Twitter, it seemed many of you wanted to see both a vegan buttercream and a cashew buttercream. But guess what? I provide6 frosting options below!
For my cake, I went for classic Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting – I couldn’t resist. But really, any of the options would be amazing! Just depends on how creative and healthy you want to be.

I hope you all LOVE this carrot cake! It’s:
Tender
Fluffy
Moist
Perfectly sweet
Carrot-packed
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect birthday cake or cake for summer celebrations, wedding showers, cookouts, and beyond! It’s insanely flavorful, rich, moist, and undetectably vegan and gluten-free. Those who are gluten-free will be happy to know there isn’t any oat flour in this cake. I also included nut-free, oil-free, and refined-sugar-free options in the notes.
If you’re into cake (who’s not?), be sure to check out our other cakes: Vegan Birthday Cake, The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes, Vegan Chocolate Hazelnut Cake, Vegan Funfetti Cupcakes, Vegan Pumpkin Cake, Vegan Pumpkin Roll, Vegan Apple Gingerbread Cake, and Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Butter and flour two 8-inch, 1 9x13-inch, or 3 6-inch round pans with coconut oil or vegan cooking spray and dust with gluten-free flour (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Shake out excess. Set aside.Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl. To flax eggs, add oil and maple syrup and whisk to combine. Next, add applesauce, sugars, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon and whisk to combine.Add lesser amount of almond milk (3/4 cup or 180 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and stir. Add grated carrot and stir. Then add almond flour and gluten-free flour blend and stir. The batter should be thick but pourable. If too thick, add remaining almond milk 1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If adding walnuts, add at this time and stir.Divide evenly among cake pan(s). Bake for 40-50 minutes or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over-baking! The gluten-free blend just takes a little longer to bake. Also, note that the size of pan you use will vary baking time.Remove from oven and let rest in the pans for 15 minutes. Then carefully run a knife along the edges and gently invert onto cooling racks to let cool completely.NOTE: This cake needs to cool completely. It benefits from plenty of airflow, and the flavors develop as the cooling process goes on. If short on time, you can speed the cooling by placing the cakes in the refrigerator or freezer until very cool to the touch.Once cooled, you can serve as is or frost! For frosting, you have several options! See options above.Store leftovers at room temperature, covered, for 2-3 days, in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, or covered well in the freezer for several weeks. However, it's best when eaten fresh.Do note that, if using vegan cream cheese or yogurt in the frosting, the cake should be stored in the refrigerator. From the refrigerator, let set out for 10-15 minutes before serving so it warms a bit and becomes more tender. Let thaw completely from the freezer."
201,Cashew Buttercream Frosting | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cashew Buttercream Frosting (2 Ways!)

Friends! It’s frosting time because I have a cake coming your way soon that needs it BIG TIME. Shall we?

This frosting is not only simple –8 ingredients required – but it also comes with 2 flavor variations: “Classic” and “Tangy Cream Cheese.”
The first is great for instances when you want a vegan buttercream for things like Funfetti Cupcakes, and the second is preferred for cakes that call for cream cheese frosting like Zucchini Cake!
I know. It’s so exciting I can hardly stand it.

The base for these frostings is soaked cashews.
For the classic, I go with coconut milk and lemon juice. And for the tangy, I go with coconut yogurt(!!) and apple cider vinegar, which provides that cream-cheese-like flavor.
Both versions are naturally sweetened with maple syrup, and they get even more flavor from vanilla extract. The result is a creamy, dreamy cashew cream that chills perfectly into frosting texture!

Your cashew cream just needs some time in the freezer with occasional whisking and then blending to get that quintessential buttercream texture. The transformation is magical.

I hope you all LOVE this frosting! It’s:
Thick
Creamy
Rich
Decadent
Naturally sweetened
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect frosting option for things like cupcakes, cakes, cookies, and more! I think it would be especially delicious on my Vegan Sugar Cookies, 1-Bowl Pumpkin Bread, and my Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake.

","Soak cashews in very hot water for 1 hour or in cool water for 6-8 hours. Drain thoroughly and add to a blender. To the blender, also add remaining ingredients, depending on which style of frosting you're going for.Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. It's important to get the frosting as creamy and smooth as possible, so blend on high with a high-speed blender until the texture is silky and smooth.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, vanilla for vanilla flavor, or (if making the tangy frosting) more apple cider vinegar or lemon zest for tang.Transfer frosting to a medium mixing bowl (with room to blend / whisk) and cover. Place in the freezer and chill for 45 minutes. Then remove from freezer and whisk. Freeze for another 45 minutes - 1 hour and whisk again. Then leave in the freezer until semi-firm to the touch (cheesecake texture // ~ 2-4 hours) and use a hand mixer (or whisk) to blend until creamy and smooth. Depending on how firm your frosting is, this may take a little work at the beginning as it softens. If too thick, microwave in 15-second increments until blendable (or leave out at room temperature to soften).Your frosting is ready to use! Or it can be stored in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days (or the freezer 1 month). The nature of this frosting is like most other frostings in that it will soften out of the refrigerator. So, if serving a cake with this frosting, it's best to keep the cake refrigerated. Once ready to serve, it is fine staying out of the refrigerator for several hours.These frostings would be great on cakes like my Vegan Apple Gingerbread Cake, Vegan Birthday Cake, Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake, Pumpkin Cake, Pumpkin Roll, or even in my Vegan Whoopie Pies!"
202,How to Make Coconut Yogurt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt

Friends, I made yogurt! Coconut yogurt to be exact.
And if I can make yogurt, you can make yogurt – promise. Let’s do this!

There areno fancy tricks or expensive equipment involved here. Just 2 simple ingredients required!
All you need iscoconut milk and probiotic capsules, which (if you’re like me) you probably have in your pantry right now. Score!
This is a 3-step process:
1) Empty coconut milk into a clean glass jar or bowl.
2) Top with probiotic and stir.
3) Cover with cheesecloth and wait.
That’s it! Seriously – it doesn’t get any easier than this. And the result is phenomenal!


I’m sure you’re thinking, “How good can homemade yogurt be?” Trust me, I’ve tried all the store-bought coconut yogurts and this by far is the best!
It’s creamy (almost like Greek yogurt!), rich, and tangy – just like the “real” thing.

Once your yogurt has activated (24-48 hours), simply refrigerate to thicken / cool and then enjoy!
I prefer my yogurt plain, but it is also delicious with maple syrup, lemon, vanilla, or fruit. For serving, I made some of my fruit compote and added some chia seeds to thicken and WOW – it was amazing with the yogurt. Dream big, friends! Just about any flavor combination works here.

I hope you all LOVE this yogurt! It’s:
Thick
Creamy
Coconutty
Probiotic-rich
Gut-healthy
Versatile
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious!
This would make the perfect satisfying snack or breakfast. I like serving mine with some banana, fresh fruit, and a sprinkle of Classic Granola or Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Granola and hemp seeds for added protein and fiber! Talk about an amazing plant-based treat.
This yogurt would also be delicious on top of things like my Life-Changing Banana Pancakes, Best Vegan GF Waffles, Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins, 1-Bowl Banana Bread, and more! And I put it to good use in upcoming recipes, so stay tuned!

Recipe updated 7/24/17 to reflect another round of testing and troubleshooting. Switched recommendation of light coconut milk to full fat! Other considerations:

Please make sure your probiotic is high quality and does not contain PREbiotics.
The combination I have had the most success with: 1 can 365 Whole Foods Full Fat Coconut Milk + 2 Renew Life 50 billion probiotic capsules.
I have not tested this recipe in a yogurt maker or with a yogurt starter/culture. So if you try them this way, let me know how it goes in the comments!
It’s important that you follow the recommendations of coconut milk brands I mention, otherwise I can’t guarantee good results. I believe Whole Foods 365 brand works so well because the flavor and consistency are nearly perfect. It does contain guar gum, which may be why it helps create smooth texture and prevents separation. Brands that do not contain guar gum are more likely to have some separation.
If you have separation, that’s OK! Either stir it in, or put it in the refrigerator separated, then scoop off the creamy top layer.
If your yogurt takes on weird colors or odd smells, something has gone wrong. This never happened to me, but it can. If this happens, throw it out! It should taste tangy, but not spoiled.
If you made this recipe with good results and you tried other brands / methods, please leave a rating and share any tips or tricks that might be useful to other readers!
I have not tested this recipe with any other non-dairy milks and have no further recommendations besides full-fat coconut milk.
Lastly, if you want to thicken your yogurt even more, place two layers of cheesecloth over a fine mesh strainer set over a large mixing bowl and carefully pour in your yogurt. Then loosely cover the top (with a lid or plastic wrap), and refrigerate / let drain for several hours (draining liquid as needed) until desired thickness is reached!

","SEE NOTES ABOVE FOR MORE TIPS! It's important to select a coconut milk that's creamy and smooth (not grainy or clumpy) to ensure that the yogurt is creamy and smooth. My favorite brands are: Thai Kitchen full fat and Whole Foods 365 full fat (BPA-free), which both offer organic options. Native Forest Full Fat(BPA-free) isn't as creamy, but it still makes tasty yogurt. I would not recommend Trader Joe's (BPA-free), which was recently reformulated and is now chunky/grainy. The recommended brands' full-fat coconut milks (and coconut cream) also work well for coconut whipped cream!Shake your coconut milk well. Then open and pour into a clean, sterilized, dry glass jar or bowl. You can easily sterilize clean jars by rinsing throughly with boiling water and letting dry completely. Just let them cool back down to room temperature before adding ingredients. For jars, I like this one from Weck. Sometimes the coconut milk is separated, so after adding it to the jar, I stir with a whisk to get it completely smooth.Empty your probiotic capsules (see brand recommendations below) into the yogurt and (important:) use a wooden or plastic spoon to stir, not metal, as a metal spoon can react negatively with the probiotics. Stir until creamy and smooth, pushing the probiotic up against the side with your spoon to evenly disperse.Cover the mixture with cheesecloth (or a very thin, clean dish towel - something that lets air in but keeps bugs out) and secure with a rubber band.Let the yogurt activate for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours (sometimes longer - 48 hours is my sweet spot for thickness and tang) in a warm place. The longer it rests, the tangier the yogurt will become. In warmer climates and summer it's easy to make yogurt if your house is warm (75 degrees F / 23 C and above). But in cooler climates or seasons, place the yogurt in the oven with the light on (do not turn on the oven), where it should have the right amount of heat to activate.That's it! Once the yogurt has reached the right amount of tanginess and thickness for your liking (be sure to sample with a wooden spoon), cover securely with a lid and refrigerate until cold. Refrigerating will also thicken the yogurt even more, almost to a Greek yogurt consistency (depending on the brand of coconut milk you used)! For even thicker yogurt, line a fine mesh strainer with two layers of cheesecloth and set over a mixing bowl. Pour in the yogurt, then loosely cover with a lid or plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight or for 12+ hours. It should thicken up quite a bit more.You have coconut yogurt (!!), which can be enjoyed plain as I prefer it, with fruit, or even with Fruit Compote. You can also add a bit of sweetener or flavor at this point, such as maple syrup and/or vanilla extract.Store covered in the refrigerator for several days (mine kept for 7 days). You'll know it's gone bad when the smell is off-putting or there is mold."
203,3-Ingredient Plantain Tortillas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Plantain Tortillas

While experimenting with plantain chips and garlicky guac (&lt;- a must-try recipe, btw), I had a few leftover plantains and was up for some experimenting.
Per usual, the big, wide internet didn’t let me down. And, in fact, it led me to discover that, among the many things you can do with plantains, you can make TORTILLAS with them.
I know! It’s crazy. It’s magic. It’s delicious. Let’s do this!

This recipe is so easy, requiring just 3 INGREDIENTS. Again, I know! It’s crazy!
You start by boiling sliced green plantains for 15 minutes to soften and tenderize the fruit. Then you just peel, throw them into a blender or afood processor with salt, and blend until you have a sticky “dough.”

Next, to roll out, I went with tapioca flour to keep this recipe bothgluten-free and grain-free.
You can also try smashing the tortillas between wax paper or plastic bags, but I found this to yield super sticky dough that was unmanageable – tapioca to the rescue!

All that’s left is a quick cook in a skillet (5-6 minutes total) and you have real-life tortillas on your hands!
I know what you’re thinking – they are probably doughy in the middle and gross and not sturdy. But no! They cook all the way through, aren’t doughy in the slightest, and are SO sturdy I would bet money they’d hold more toppings than a traditional corn tortilla.
Yeah, I said it.

I hope you LOVE these plantain tortillas! They’re:
Easy to make
Tender
Customizable (add garlic or herbs!)
Flexible + sturdy
Neutral in flavor
&amp; Super delicious
These would make the perfect vessel for things like Vegan Barbacoa, Vegan “Pulled Pork,” Quinoa Taco Meat, Garlicky Guacamole, Roasted Jalapeño Vegan Queso, Saucy Portobello Mushrooms,and 10-Minute Chimichurri. I also bet they would work wonderfully for enchiladas (next on my list)!
I also think, if baked, they would make a delicious tostada. Or, if sliced and then baked, they would make a delicious chip (see notes)!
If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistaker on Instagram so we can see your tortillas in action. Cheers, friends!

","Slice plantains into 4 sections, and then halve those sections lengthwise (top to bottom // see photo).Bring a pot of water to a boil and add plantains. Boil for 15 minutes to tenderize the plantains. Then drain and let cool slightly.Peel plantains and discard the peel. Then add the plantain and salt to a blender or a food processor. Blend until a ball forms (~30 seconds) - it will be sticky (this is normal).Dust a clean surface with tapioca and take small (~3 Tbsp) amounts of the dough and dust with tapioca. Dust a rolling pin with tapioca and roll out until almost paper thin (see photo). The dough is sticky so add more tapioca as needed. Repeat until all tortillas are formed (~10-12 as original recipe is written).Optional: you can use a knife or pizza cutter to make the edges a perfect circle, but this is optional!To cook, heat a large skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with coconut or avocado oil. Once hot, add one to two tortillas at a time (or however many fit comfortably in the pan) and cook until dried out and slightly browned on either side (~ 3 min per side). Continue until all tortillas are cooked (no need to continue adding more oil). See notes for baking instructions.Enjoy immediately as a vessel for things like Vegan Barbacoa, Quinoa Taco Meat, Guacamole, and more!Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (though best when fresh), or in the freezer up to 1 month. If frozen, thaw before use. Heat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven, or on the stovetop."
204,Mustard Green Cherry Salad & Tahini Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mustard Green Cherry Salad with Nut Cheese &amp; Tahini Dressing

Ah, welcome to my version of summertime eats.
Produce, fruit, and plenty of quick heat-free meals, like this gem of a salad! It’s inspired by ourCSA box, which has been brimming with mustard greens – a new love of mine. Shall we?

I have been envisioning this salad ever since I discovered our macadamia nut cheese! I knew that it would meld perfectly with greens, cherries, and tahini dressing, and I was right!
This salad requires 30 minutes (or less, depending on if you chill your nut “cheese”), 10 healthy ingredients, and no cooking!
The base is mustard greens, which happen to be a favorite of mine this time of year. Mustard greens have the texture of a spinach-kale hybrid, but they taste like mustard! I know – it’s incredible. Plus, they’re super high in vitamins and minerals! Total win-win situation right here.

Next are my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, toasted almonds, cherries, and my go-to, 3-ingredient tahini dressing!
The combination strikes the perfect balance between creamy, savory, and sweet. It was love at first bite.

I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s:
Creamy
Fresh
Nutty
“Cheesy”
Fruity
Insanely satisfying
&amp; Super healthy + delicious

","If making macadamia nut cheese, add macadamia nuts to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, sea salt, and the lesser amount of water (1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Mix/blend, scraping down sides as needed. Then add more water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms. I find I get the best texture results with a food processor, but in a pinch, a blender can work too. It just generally requires more scraping and more liquid.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for saltiness, lemon juice for acidity/brightness, or garlic powder for garlic flavor. Blend again to combine. If adding herbs, add at this time.At this point, the ""cheese"" is ready to eat! But it's better after chilling. Transfer ""cheese"" to cheesecloth (or a thin, clean towel) and rest over a fine mesh strainer set over a mixing bowl. Twist the top of the cheesecloth so it forms a loose ball. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, up to 24-36 hours. The longer it chills, the firmer the ""cheese"" will become.In the meantime, prepare tahini dressing by adding tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup to a small mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Then add water a little at a time until a thick but pourable sauce is achieved (~1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for acidity or maple syrup for sweetness. Set aside.Once cheese is slightly chilled (at least 15-20 minutes), plate salad by adding mustard greens, almonds, and cherries to a serving platter or dividing between serving bowls. Top with half of the macadamia nut cheese (1/2 cup as original recipe is written) spread into dollops (you will have half leftover). Serve with dressing on side.Leftover dressing will keep in the refrigerator up to 5 days. Leftover nut cheese will keep for 7 days, sometimes longer. Leftover (undressed) salad will keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator."
205,Baked Plantain Chips & Garlicky Guacamole | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Plantain Chips + Garlicky Guacamole

I’ve been on a plantain kick lately. Why, you ask?

They’re delicious
They’re healthy
They’re extremely versatile
You can make CHIPS with them!

Need I say more?

This recipe is easy, requiring just 7 ingredients and 30 minutes!
The base is thinly sliced green plantains tossed in a bit of coconut oil and salt and then baked to crispy perfection.
The result is shockingly delicious and perfect for dipping in delicious things like GUACAMOLE. I know – it’s happening. Right now.


I have only posted a Greek Guacamole recipe before, so a more traditional version was necessary.
My go-to guac is pretty basic: avocados, onion, lime, cilantro, and raw garlic for a zesty, spicy punch of flavor (throw in a jalapeño for more spice). Creamy, salty, citrusy, spicy – what more could you ask for?

I hope you all LOVE this version of chips + guac! It’s:
Easy
Quick
Healthy
Crunchy + creamy
Grain-free
Super flavorful
&amp; So delicious
This would make a delicious chip and dip for parties, BBQs, or just lazy days spent snacking. I called it “lunch” two days in a row, so there’s really no judgment in how you want to enjoy this simple dish.

They should be not quite paper thin but close (see photo). I tried using a knife to thinly slice, but the plantains didn’t crisp up as well.Add to a mixing bowl and drizzle with oil* and salt. Gently toss with a spoon to combine. Then arrange in a single layer on the baking sheets, making sure none are overlapping or they won’t crisp up.Bake for 18-25 minutes or until crispy and slightly golden brown, being careful not to burn. Rotate pans at the halfway point to ensure even baking.Once out of the oven, sprinkle with a bit more salt and lime zest (optional) and toss. Let cool.While chips are baking, prepare guacamole by adding all ingredients to a small mixing bowl, mashing with a fork, then stirring to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime for acidity, salt for saltiness, or garlic for bite/zing. Transfer to serving dish.Serve guacamole with chips and enjoy. Store leftover guacamole covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days, placing plastic wrap or parchment paper on the surface (in addition to a lid) to help from browning.

Friends, I’m so excited to share this recipe with you! What started as a “tempeh taco ‘meat'” experiment/flop turned into a major success.
Without further ado, let’s make vegan “barbacoa!”

I was initially hoping to make tempeh taco meat. But because tempeh benefits from some sweetness in a marinade/sauce, I just couldn’t get the flavor right.
So I pivoted and remembered how the mixture of carrots and lentils in my Best Vegan Pulled “Pork” Sandwich blew me away. I decided to try to morph that recipeinto vegan “barbacoa.” Total win!
The base of this 1-pot recipe is onion, garlic, shredded carrots, and cooked lentils (I used canned to save time). The smokiness comes from ground smoked paprika, cumin, and cloves. And the heat comes from chipotle peppers in adobo sauce – a favorite ingredient for adding smoky, earthy spice.
To balance the spice and smokiness, I added some coconut sugar for sweetness, lime juice and apple cider vinegar for acidity, and coconut aminos for that “umami” flavor. Then I let it simmer to deepen in color and flavor until it was tender, delectable, and insanely flavorful. Like whoa.


I hope you guys LOVE this “barbacoa!” It’s:
Tender
Smoky
Flavorful
Spicy
Hearty
Satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect topping for dishes like tacos, taco salads, nachos, and more! And I think it would be insanely delicious inside enchiladas (added to my recipe list!) and taquitos (find a version in our cookbook!).
This barbacoa is delicious on its own, but it would also pair extremely well with things like my 5-Ingredient Ginger Beer Margaritas, 10-Minute Chimichurri Sauce, Mexican Quinoa Salad, Kale Chip Nachos, Vegan Mexican 7-Layer Dip, and Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli. And if you’re into vegan meat substitutes, be sure to check out myEggplant Bacon, Coconut Bacon, Tempeh Breakfast Sausage, and Quinoa Taco Meat!

","Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), onion, and garlic. Sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until tender and slightly browned.Next, add cooked lentils, carrots, coconut sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, cloves, oregano, chipotle peppers + adobo sauce (start with 1 tsp for low spice level), coconut aminos, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, water, and bay leaves (optional). Stir to combine.Cover and cook over medium-low heat for at least 15 minutes (or up to 30-40 minutes on low heat) or until the carrots are tender and the color has deepened. Stir occasionally and add more water as needed if it dries up.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more paprika or cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, coconut sugar for sweetness, lime for acidity, coconut aminos for “umami” flavor, or chipotle peppers for spice. I added more chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, coconut aminos, lime, paprika, and salt.Optional: Scoop half of the mixture into a food processor and (using the ""s""-shaped blade) mix/pulse to mash some of the lentils and carrots together. This creates a more cohesive texture, which I prefer.Serve the mixture on tortillas (I used corn tortillas heated over an open flame for 20 seconds on each side). For toppings, I went with shredded red cabbage, sliced radish, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges or hot sauce for more flavor.Store leftover “barbacoa” covered in the refrigerator for 4-5 days or up to 1 month in the freezer. Reheat on the stovetop until hot, adding water as needed to add moisture back in."
207,Raw Romaine Taco Boats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Rainbow “Raw-maine” Taco Boats

You guys have requested more no-cook / heat-free dinners, and this is the first one that came to mind!
If you’ve never had romaine taco boats, you haven’t lived! OK, maybe you’ve lived, but you haven’t enjoyed the freshest, most satisfying dinner I know.
Let’s make “Raw-maine” tacos!

This recipe is simple, with just 10 ingredients, 15 minutes, and no cooking required!
Romaine leaves replace traditional taco shells for a crunchy, nutritious vessel that’s perfect for all the goodness that’s to come.
I went for beet hummus! But to keep these raw, you could either skip the hummus or find (or make) a sprouted hummus.

Next comes fresh veggies of just about every color for a seriously crunchy, nutritious, and colorful filling.
Hemp seeds are optional, but they add even more protein and health perks. And last but not least, the sauce!
You could go either savory with my 10-Minute Chimichurrior tangy and sweet with my 4-ingredient tahini dressing (recipe below). Personally, I prefer the tahini dressing. But you can’t go wrong either way!

I hope you LOVE these taco boats! They’re:
Fresh
Flavorful
Healthy
Satisfying
Versatile
Easy
&amp; Delicious!
This would make a delicious entrée for two or a side or appetizer for four! While delicious on their own, they would pair well with Easy Vegan Falalel, Creamy Roasted Red Pepper + Tomato Soup, Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowls, 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese + Vegan Crudité, or Sun-Dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers!

","If making hummus, prepare first using either my 5-Minute Plain Hummus, or Roasted Beet Hummus (I used raw beets instead of roasted). To keep this recipe raw, use a raw, sprouted hummus dip (found at most grocery stores).Prepare sauce by adding tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, and salt to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Then add water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a pourable dressing is formed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, lemon for acidity, or maple syrup for sweetness. Transfer to a serving vessel or ramekin or set aside.Arrange lettuce boats on a serving platter and begin filling with 1-2 Tbsp (15-30 g) hummus. Then top with tomatoes, sprouts, carrots, cabbage, avocado, and hemp seeds (optional).Either drizzle with tahini sauce or serve on the side. Best when fresh. Store leftover tacos in the refrigerator up to 3 days (be sure to add lemon or lime juice to avocado to help it from turning). Tahini sauce will keep for 4-5 days."
208,Baked Sweet Potatoes 2 Ways | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Sweet Potatoes 2 Ways!

When I quizzed you all onTwitter about what kind of recipes you want to see more of on Minimalist Baker, the overwhelming majority of you said healthy, savory entrées! You are my kind of people.
Not to worry, there will still be desserts – there will always be room for dessert. But I’m excited to continue adding healthy, easy, plant-based meal ideas, starting with my go-to meal when I don’t feel like cooking: baked sweet potatoes (just 30 minutes required)!

I included two varieties of sweet potatoes: 1 sweet, 1 savory.
For the sweet version, I went with my 4-ingredient Vegan Nutella (!), bananas, berries, coconut, and cinnamon. This is the perfect “dessert for a meal” type of recipe (if you’re into that sort of thing – I certainly am).

And for the savory version, I went with my beloved combo of avocado, nutritional yeast, sea salt, and red pepper flake. I also added hemp seeds for more healthy fats, fiber, and protein.
This is inspired by my go-to Avocado Toast recipe, and it leaves me satisfied every time!

I hope you enjoy this first of many plant-based entrée ideas! These baked sweet potatoes are:
Easy
Sweet + Savory
Healthy
Quick
Satisfying
&amp; Super versatile

Bake for 25-28 minutes or until tender to the touch. Baking time will vary depending on size of sweet potato.Once sweet potatoes are baked, turn faceup and place on serving plate(s). For the sweet version, top with nut butter, banana, blueberries, cinnamon, salt, and a bit of flaked coconut.For the savory version, top with avocado, nutritional yeast, salt, hemp seeds, and red pepper flake.These sweet potatoes make the perfect lazy meal when you don’t feel like cooking. They’re ideal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! You can also make sweet potatoes ahead of time, store in the refrigerator up to a few days, and reheat in a cast-iron skillet on the stovetop, in the microwave, or a 350-degree F (176 C) oven."
209,Sweet Potato Salad With Avocado | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato &amp; Avocado Green Salad

On a recent trip to Kansas for a friend’s wedding, I came to the realization that airplane food is just never going to do it for me.
There are rarely any good vegetarian options that aren’t slathered in five kinds of cheese, and there’s hardly ever a fresh vegetable in sight.
OK, rant over. The solution? Bring your own lunch! And so I did.
This recipe is inspired by my simple airplane salad that requires just 30 minutes to make, and it’s insanely healthy and delicious. Let’s do it!

The base of this salad is organic spinach and mizuna lettuce from ourorganic CSA! However, you can use whatever greens you have on hand. I think kale and green lettuce would also work well.
Next comes sweet potatoes that are roasted until tender and golden brown, as well as a ripe avocado for plenty of plant-based fiber and healthy fat.
Lastly? The dressing! It’s all about the dressing, which is my go-to3-ingredient lemon-maple tahini dressing! It’s creamy, citrusy, and subtly sweet, and it complements this salad perfectly.

That’s really it! It’s light and refreshing yet satisfying.
For added protein, I sprinkled on a healthy dose of hemp seeds, which are a “perfect protein” and contain all 20 amino acids(among other amazing health benefits). Can we say superfood much? However, you can also add something like crispy baked chickpeas for added protein and fiber.

I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s:
Simple
Quick
Fresh
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Crazy delicious
This makes a perfect portable lunch, as it can be served chilled or at room temperature (making it ideal for long flights!). It’s delicious on its own and serves one as an entrée (with 22+ g protein!). And it would also make a delicious side to mains like my Grillable Veggie Burger, Chickpea Bolognese, or 8-Ingredient Zucchini Lasagna!

210,Grain-Free Vegan Berry Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grain-Free Berry Crisp

It’s berry season! And I can’t think of any better way to celebrate than with a crisp.
Because many of you are gluten-free and some grain-free, I decided to tackle a crisp that was completely grain-free! However, if you have a nut allergy, you can easily substitute oats or even coconut. This is a very flexible recipe that also happens to be insanely delicious.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl to prepare.
The berries are added directly to a baking dish then topped with maple syrup, arrowroot starch (to help thicken the berry juice), and lemon juice for a bit of brightness and acidity.

Next comes the crisp, which is kept grain-free with a mixture of almond flour, shredded coconut, and chopped pecans. It’s also naturally sweetened with coconut sugar (!!), which keeps this recipe refined-sugar-free!
Just 40-45 minutes in the oven and this beauty is ready to enjoy. It gets crisp and golden brown on top, and the juices from the berries meddle and create a lovely “sauce.” Oh, mama.


I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Easy to make
Berry-packed
Naturally sweetened
Warm + comforting
Crisp on top
&amp; Entirely delicious
This would make the perfect summertime dessert for dinner parties, BBQs, and celebrations or an easy weeknight treat. It’s delicious on its own, but it would pair perfectly with some Coconut Whipped Cream or Vanilla Coconut Ice Cream.

Then add coconut oil (or vegan butter) and mix again (with a spoon or your hands) until evenly distributed. Taste a little and see if it’s sweet enough for you. Add either more coconut sugar or a little maple syrup (I added 2 Tbsp (30 ml) more maple syrup // amount as original recipe is written).Spread the crisp topping evenly over the fruit. Bake uncovered on the center oven rack for 40-45 minutes or until the fruit is bubbling and the top is golden brown.Let cool 10 minutes before serving. Serve as is, or with Coconut Whipped Cream or Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days."
211,How to Make Nut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How To Make Nut Butter
Consider this your one-stop resource for how to make nut butter at home! It’s so easy, often requires just 1 (or 2) ingredients, and comes together in less than 30 minutes!

First, choose your base.
I love starting with raw, organic almonds. Then I mix in a few walnuts for omega-3s. However, hazelnuts make a delicious butter on their own, as do pecans. So many nuts to choose from!
Or, go for seeds! Sunflower seeds make amazing butter, too. I include links to several recipes below.


Hazelnuts have skins, which often shed during roasting. So it’s best to remove those before blending (see photo below).

Then, it’s nut butter time!
Either use a food processor or high-speed blender to creamy a creamy, delicious nut butter.
Just 1 ingredient – that’s right! No oil, water, or sweetener. In fact, adding in ingredients like oil, water, or even maple syrup tend to disrupt the creamy texture and shouldn’t be added.
The blending processgenerally takes 10-12 minutes, so be patient! It’s worth the wait.

While your nut butter is blending, you can choose a few add-ins (if desired).
My go-tos are sea salt and flax seed. But you could also add hemp seed, chia seed, coconut butter, a dash of vanilla, or even dark chocolate! Dark chocolate + hazelnuts = NUTELLA. I know! It’s amazing.

That’s it! You nut butter made at home. It’s that easy.
Plus, making your own nut butter allows you to create your own blends, add fun mix-ins, control salt content, AND save money! So awesome. See my favorite nut butter recipes below in the recipe.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and add raw nuts to the baking sheet. If sprouted, nuts won't need as long to roast and benefit from a 5-8 minute roast at a lower temperature (325 F or 162 C). Roast raw nuts for 8-12 minutes, or until fragrant and slightly golden brown.If roasting hazelnuts, remove from oven once toasted and transfer to a clean dish towel. Rub the hazelnuts against one another using the towel to remove the skins (see photo). Removing most of the skins is preferred (not all will come off).Add roasted nuts to a food processor or blender and blend / mix until a creamy butter forms. The nuts should go from whole, to meal, to clumps, to creamy nut butter. This can take up to 10-12 or more minutes so be patient. Scrape down sides as needed.Once creamy, add salt (or other add-ins) to taste. Then transfer to a clean jar or container and store in the refrigerator up to 3 weeks (sometimes longer).Some other variations include: Cinnamon Raisin Peanut Butter, Cinnamon Hazelnut Butter, Almond Joy Butter, and our Super Seedy Sunflower Butter!"
212,How to Make Coconut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Coconut Butter

Have you ever wanted to make your own coconut butter but didn’t know how? This is the recipe for you. Bonus? Itrequires just1 bowl, 1 ingredient, and 10 minutes. Shall we?

The 1 ingredient is shredded unsweetened coconut. I find that using desiccated coconut (buying options included below) works best. But I speculate you could also use any unsweetened shredded coconut you can find.
The next important part is equipment! I highly recommend using a food processoras the design of blenders isn’t conducive to blending coconut butter. It tends to kick up the flakes and not allow them to blend, which is how it gets creamy.
So stick with a food processor for best results. Then, it’s just blend, blend, blend until you have creamy, delicious coconut butter on your hands!



Coconut butter is:
Unsweetened
Wholesome
Creamy
Rich
Super coconutty
Delicious
&amp; So easy to make
It’s perfect for snacking on straight out of the jar, but also pairs well with things like baked sweet potatoes, ice cream, smoothies, muffins, banana bread, waffles, pancakes, and more!
I’ve also used it in recipes to make delicious things like Vegan Fudge, Peanut Butter Fudge, Vegan White Chocolate Truffles, and Vegan White Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs!

","Add lesser amount of shredded coconut (3 cups or 240 g as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) into a food processor. If your food processor is larger than 7 or 8 cups, you may have to add the additional  shredded coconut (1 cup or 80 g as original recipe is written // or more // adjust if altering batch size) so there's enough content to grind and churn into ""butter."" In addition, we have tried using a blender and have to say it doesn't work because the blender kicks the coconut up and doesn't allow it to process. It's also important that you have a good quality food processor. We recommend the 7 or 8 cup Cuisinart Prep. We've heard mixed reviews on the Ninja blender / processor being able to churn the coconut into ""butter."" So for this reason, we highly recommend using the Cuisinart food processor, or a similar model.Mix until a creamy butter forms - sometimes up to 10 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. Mine usually takes about 8-10 minutes, and I scrape down the sides 2-3 times to ensure the coconut is getting processed well.Once it's gone liquid and creamy, you can add things such as salt, vanilla extract, or stevia. But it doesn't need anything at all in my experience! If you still don't have coconut butter at this point, it's likely you either a) didn't add enough coconut flakes to the food processor ,or b) your food processor likely isn't designed for this type of recipe or isn't powerful enough. The main issue with making coconut butter tends to be an issue of equipment rather than method.Store at room temperature up to 2 weeks (sometimes more). Depending on the temperature of your home, it will likely harden once cooled. To use, you can either heat it up in the microwave, or place in a shallow pot of very hot water and it will soften. Alternatively, if placing on hot food, scoop out and it should melt quite easily on the food.I love putting coconut butter on things like baked sweet potatoes, bananas, muffins, waffles, pancakes, smoothies,ice cream, and oats, and especially just eating it straight from the jar!"
213,Easy Vegan Macaroons | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Macaroons (6 ingredients!)

Does aquafaba know any limits? No, it does not.
Have you tried using it yet? It may seem intimidating at first, but once you do it once, it’s like second nature.
Ever since discovering the magic of aquafaba, I’ve saved every drop of chickpea brine from my canned chickpeas to put to good use in recipes like THESE aquafaba macaroons! Let’s do this!


This recipe is simple, requiring just 6 ingredients. Plus, from start to finish, it requires about45 minutes.
The base is toasted shredded coconut (not to be confused with desiccated coconut, which is much stiffer).
When it comes to shredded coconut, you want it as light and fluffy as possible. I included two brand recommendations in the notes!


The other important element in this recipe is aquafaba. The structure and the makeup of this magical brine allow it to be whipped into things like meringue andmayonnaiseand used as a fluffy egg substitute in things like donuts, cakes, and cookies!
In this recipe, the aquafaba is whipped into semi-stiff peaks. Then you simply add a little salt, vanilla, coconut oil, and maple syrup – which keeps this recipe naturally sweetened!

All that’s left to do is stir your maple-sweetened coconut into your aquafaba base, scoop, and bake.
The dough should be wet but scoopable. This is key! If it’s too dry, the macaroons will be crumbly. If it’s too wet, they won’t fluff up in the oven. I include some tips in the instructions to help you achieve the right texture.

The name of the baking game here is slow and low. I bake these for 20 minutes at 325 degrees F (162 C) and then 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F (176 C). This allows the macaroons to firm up, and the higher temperature adds a beautiful golden-brown exterior.
YUM. You can enjoy these macaroons as is or create a quick, 2-ingredient chocolate coating to dip and drizzle them with. This is completely optional, but it takes them to the next level for sure!

I hope you all LOVE these macaroons! They’re:
Fluffy
Crisp on the outside
Tender on the inside
Coconutty
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Insanely delicious
These would make the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand during the week or for road trips and picnics. They’re extremely portable, which makes them ideal gifts or treats to bring along to baby showers, bridal showers, BBQs, and more.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and spread coconut on a baking sheet (or more baking sheets if making a larger batch). Toast for 2-4 minutes or until just slightly golden brown (be careful not to burn // see photo). Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (162 C).Transfer coconut to a food processor (or a mixing bowl) and add just under half of the maple syrup (3 Tbsp or 45 ml maple syrup as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Pulse a few times (or stir) to combine, being careful not to overmix. This will slightly moisten and sweeten the coconut (see photo). Set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add aquafaba and cream of tartar (optional), and whip with a hand or stand mixer (you can whisk by hand, but it takes longer).Once fluffy and semi-stiff peaks have formed (see photo), add remaining maple syrup (4 Tbsp or 60 ml maple syrup as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), vanilla, and salt and whip again to combine. Lastly, pour in melted coconut oil and whip again to combine. At this point, taste your aquafaba and see if it needs any more sweetness. You can add either a little stevia or a bit more maple syrup. But don’t go overboard with the maple syrup or it may deflate your aquafaba.Start with adding 3/4 of your coconut to the aquafaba and fold/stir to combine. If it looks too wet, add more coconut flakes a little at a time until you get a very moist “dough” (see photo). If the dough is too wet, they won't rise in the oven. If it's too dry, they will be crumbly. So be sure to add a little at a time until the proper texture is achieved. If you add all of the coconut and it still appears too wet, it's fine to add a little untoasted coconut!Measure out heaping 1 Tbsp amounts (I like this scoop) and scoop onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F (162 C) for 25 minutes. Then increase heat to 350 degrees F (176 C) and bake for 8-10 min more or until golden brown and semi-firm to the touch (see photo).Let cool. Then enjoy. For a chocolate coating (optional), melt vegan dark chocolate and coconut oil over a double boiler (or in the microwave in 30 second increments) until smooth and creamy. Then dip the macaroons into the chocolate and place on a parchment- or wax paper-lined baking sheet or serving platter. Drizzle the tops with remaining chocolate and set in the refrigerator (or freezer) to cool until the chocolate is firm to the touch.Store leftover macaroons covered and at room temperature up to 3 days, in the refrigerator up to 5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. They are crispy the first day and then tend to soften, which is normal. They are still delicious though! Just best when fresh."
214,Blueberry Sweet Potato Breakfast Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Savory Breakfast Salad

During a recent trip to wine country,we stayed at one of our favorite hotels and I was so delighted to see a “breakfast salad” option on their morning menu. Salad &gt; donuts almost any day (unless it’s Sunday).
You better believe I ordered it all threedays (with my own modifications) and loved every bite. The minute we got home and picked up our first CSA of the year (!!), I got to work recreating my own version of the salad with beautiful greens and organic produce. I can’t wait to share this gorgeous salad with you. Shall we?

The base of this 20-minute, 9-ingredient salad is a bed of greens. I went with organic mustard greens (!) and endive. However, you can really use whatever you have on hand.
Next is sweet (or baby red) potatoes cooked to perfection on the stovetop, as well as blueberries and avocado for plenty of antioxidants, healthy fats, and plant-based fiber.
For a bit of protein, I went with hummus and hemp seeds – a lovely combination that pairs well with just about any salad.
For dressing, I kept things simple with a basic lemon vinaigrette. But you could easily sub in balsamic vinegar if that’s more your style or even just a drizzle of maple syrup, lemon, and tahini (like in my Detox Salad!).


I hope you all LOVE this summer-friendly salad! It’s:
Fresh
Light
Satisfying
Superfood-packed
Colorful
Delicious
&amp; So easy to make
This would make the perfect weekday or weekend breakfast when you have a bit of time to spare but don’t want to turn the oven on – which makes it summer (and warm-weather) friendly and perfect for using up seasonal produce from farmers markets and CSAs!

If browning too quickly, turn heat down to medium-low. Continue cooking until golden brown on both sides and tender - about 10-15 minutes total.In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper to a small jar or mixing bowl and shaking or whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for acidity, oil for creamy texture, or salt and pepper for overall flavor. Set aside.To serve, divide greens between serving plates and top with roasted sweet potatoes, blueberries, avocado, hummus, hemp seeds (optional), and parsley (optional). Serve with dressing on the side.Enjoy immediately. Leftovers will keep (stored separate from dressing) for 2-3 days, though best when fresh. I like storing my salad dressing at room temperature (up to 2 days)."

Wait. You already knew that, too (obviously). Hmph.
Well, then you won’t be surprised that I’m sharing a recipe for chocolate granola! Besides, who doesn’t want a(healthier) version of Cocoa Puffs in their life?

Pulse a few times (or stir) to combine.In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil and maple syrup until melted and combined. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix or stir well. If using a food processor, this breaks down the oats and nuts a bit more so it's a finer texture, but this is optional.Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet (or more baking sheets if making a larger batch) and bake for 17-24 minutes (or until fragrant and deep golden brown), stirring a bit near the halfway point to ensure even baking.Let cool completely. Then add chocolate (optional). Place in a container that has an air-tight seal, and it should keep for a few weeks. Or store in the freezer up to 1 month or longer."
216,Easy Red Salsa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Red Salsa

How have Igotten 5 years into writing a food blog and not provided a simple red salsa recipe?
How dare I? How could I? I know. Shame, shame. But I realized this recently and am excited to fill the void with this EASY, 10-minute Red Tomato Salsa! Let’s do it!

I did quite a bit of experimenting for this 10-minute, 8-ingredient, 1- bowl recipe.
The dreamy minimalist in me thought, “Cool. I’ll just throw some tomatoes and onion and a pepper in a blender and ‘voila!’ I’ll have salsa!”
Not quite.

While you can go that route, I find that it yields a watery, flavorless salsa, and I’m obviously not down for that. So, instead, I tested multiple canned-tomato varieties as a base and found fire-roasted tomatoes to be the best fit!
They’re extremely smoky and complex, and they add a rich tomato flavor to this salsa. Supporting ingredients like onion, cilantro, lime, garlic, and jalapeño or serrano pepper round the flavors out to yield the perfect red salsa.

I hope you all LOVE this salsa! It’s:
Fresh
Flavorful
Smoky
Spicy
Quick + Easy
&amp; Delicious
This is the perfect salsa for dipping tortilla chips, Frito chips, or even kale chips! It would also make a delicious addition to things like our Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups, Black Bean Butternut Squash Enchiladas, Best Damn Vegan Nachos, Sweet Potato Kale Chip Nachos, or Plantain Black Bean Tacos.

","Add tomatoes, pepper, cilantro, lime, onion, cumin, salt, and garlic to food processor or blender and pulse to mix. You're looking for a well-blended but semi-chunky salsa.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, lime for acidity, garlic for kick/zing, cilantro for herb flavor, pepper or mild green chilies for heat, or a little stevia or sugar to sweeten/offset heat.Serve immediately with chips of choice, such as DIY Chili Cheeze Fritos, tortilla chips, or kale chips!Store leftovers in a well-sealed container in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month."
217,Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies

On a recent trip to California, I trieda chocolate chip cookie like no other chocolate chip cookie.
It was healthy (like seriously healthy).
It was delicious.
It was chocolaty
It was perfect.
I got straight tothe kitchen when we got home. The code had to be cracked!

These almond butter cookies are insanely delicious, require just 1 bowland9 ingredients, and come together in 1 hour. And although they aren’t exactly like the cookie I tried, this inspired version is legit.
This recipeis slightly adapted from my Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies, but they are more tender and less involved (no whipping required).
The base is coconut oil, coconut sugar, almond butter, and aquafaba! And the “flours” are almond flour and shredded coconut. This creates a light and fluffy cookie infused with almond flavor and studded with chocolate chips!
And because many of you are doing less oil in your diet, I included a lower-oil option in the notes! I got you.


I hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender
Fluffy
Grain-free
Chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Super delicious
These would make the perfect healthier cookie to snack on throughout the week or to bring to BBQs and parties. They are delicious on their own, but they would pair so well with some homemade almond milk!

218,Macadamia Nut Cheese and Vegan Crudité | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Macadamia Cheese + Vegan Crudité!

I asked you allon Twitterrecently what kindsof recipes you wanted to see this month and many of you requestedroom-temperature meals that didn’t require much heat and were portable for picnics, BBQs, and dinner parties.
I like the way you think! And I have asolution. Let’s do this!

The star of this (30-minute) vegan crudité is my 5-minute Macadamia Nut Cheese! Yes, 5 minutes.
Unlike most other nuts, macadamia nuts don’t require soaking because they’re already so tender and soft. They blend up beautifully with just thehelp of a littlewater.
Inspired by my Macadamia Ricotta, the cheesy flavor in this recipe comes from nutritional yeast, which is a vibrant yellow yeast that’s packed with vitamin B12. Delicious and healthy? Yes, please.

Beyond nutritional yeast, you just need a little lemon juice, salt, and garlic powder. Fresh herbs add a hint of color and flavor, but they are not necessary.


Once blended, your macadamia nut “cheese” is ready to enjoy! Yes, vegan cheese in 5 minutes – this is real life. It does, however, benefit from some time in the fridge, where it will stiffen and the flavors will develop.
While that’s happening, prepare the rest of your vegetables. I LOVE the flavor and texture of the nut cheese with roasted vegetables, so I went with beets and carrots, which sweeten and caramelize when roasted. But you can also just stick toraw vegetables if you prefer to keep your oven off.

I hope you all LOVE this nut cheese + crudité! It’s:
Easy
Fast
Healthy
Flavorful
Fresh
Portable
&amp; DELICIOUS
This is the perfect meal or appetizer for things like BBQs, picnics, and happy hours. I think it’s a good amount for 4-6 people as a snack. Ortwo people could easily split thisas a meal and be very satisfied.
In addition to the nut cheese, you can also serve this with hummus (I share several recipes below), baba ganoush, crackers, and roasted nuts.

","If roasting vegetables, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or use more baking sheets if making a larger batch.Once preheated, add carrots and beets to the baking sheet and drizzle with oil (or water), salt, and pepper. Toss to combine, and arrange in a single layer. Bake for 17-22 minutes or until slightly golden brown and tender.In the meantime, make your ""cheese."" Add macadamia nuts to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, sea salt, and lesser amount of water (1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Mix/blend, scraping down sides as needed. Then add more water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms. I find I get the best texture results with a food processor, but in a pinch, a blender can work too. It just generally requires more scraping and more liquid.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for saltiness, lemon juice for acidity/brightness, or garlic powder for garlic flavor. Blend again to combine. If adding herbs, add at this time.At this point, the ""cheese"" is ready to eat! But it's better after chilling. Transfer ""cheese"" to cheesecloth (or a thin, clean towel) and rest over a fine mesh strainer set over a mixing bowl. Twist the top of the cheesecloth so it forms a loose ball. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, up to 24-36 hours. The longer it chills, the firmer the ""cheese"" will become.Once vegetables are roasted, assemble crudité platter with macadamia ""cheese,"" vegetables, hummus (optional), and any other desired sides. I personally loved the roasted vegetables with a drizzle of tahini and maple syrup then dipped in the nut cheese - swoon!Best when fresh. Store leftover nut ""cheese"" in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. Serves 2 as an entrée, 4-6 as an appetizer."
219,Grilled Veggie Skewers with Chimichurri Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grilled Veggie Skewers with Chimichurri Sauce

Ahhh, summertime. My favorite seasonof the year has practically arrived and we’ve officially dusted off our grill! Best. Feeling. Ever.
Ourfirst grilling recipe this summer is grilled veggie skewers! This is the perfect, easy side or entrée to enjoy on the patio on hot summer nights or to bring along to BBQs. My10-minute chimichurri sauce adds the perfect, citrusy-spicy touch. Let’s get to grilling!

These skewers are easy to make, especially if you have a grill. But, if you don’t, you can easily broil these in the oven or even use a grill pan and cook them on the stovetop.
They require just 7 ingredients (not including the sauce) and just 30 minutes to prepare.

For vegetables, I went fora mix of savory and sweet: bell peppers, onion, sweet potatoes, baby potatoes, and portobello mushrooms. All they need is a little salt and pepper and the grill does the rest.
The chimichurri sauce – my new favorite sauce– pairs perfectly with these skewers, adding a punch of green color and big, vibrant flavor.

I hope you all LOVE these skewers! They’re:
Easy to make
Super healthy
Fresh
Colorful
Delicious
&amp; Perfect for summer
This isthe ultimate grilling recipe for summer. For even more protein, you could add some seasonedtofu or marinatedtempeh! Or you could serve these over a bed of cooked quinoa.

","Heat up your grill or preheat oven to medium/high broil.Place your chopped sweet potato and potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook or ""parboil"" for about 10 minutes or until almost tender. You want them to be semi-tender - firm enough to stay on a skewer, but tender enough that they won't require too much time on the grill/in the oven. Drain and let cool slightly.Assemble skewers by adding the vegetables in layers to the skewers, leaving enough room at the top and the bottom to help with flipping and preventing vegetables from falling off. Brush with a neutral, high-heat oil such as avocado or coconut oil (or sub water if avoiding oil) and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper on all sides.Grill (or broil) until grill marks are present and vegetables are tender and cooked through - about 10-15 minutes. Flip once at the halfway mark to ensure even cooking. If browning too quickly, move to the perimeter of the grill, where the heat is less intense (or turn oven heat down/move the pan lower in the oven). If grilling corn, place directly on the grill without the husk, or on the broil pan with the other vegetables.While the vegetables are grilling, prepare your chimichurri or BBQ sauce (optional).Enjoy as is or with my Chimichurri Sauce or BBQ sauce! Best when fresh, though leftover grilled vegetables will keep covered in the refrigerator up to a few days. Reheat on the stovetop in a cast-iron or metal skillet or in the oven at 350 degrees F (176 C)."

221,Vegan Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake

We asked you all on Twitter what recipes you wanted to see for May and June, and the most popular request by far was Strawberry Shortcake! I like you guys.
I did quite a bit of research for this recipebut ended up having to do just a couple of tweaks to the recipe before it was perfect.
Let’s not waste any time. On to the shortcakes!

This recipe is simple, usingeasy-to-master methodsand10 basics ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Plus,they come together in less than 1 hour!
The shortcakesare adapted from my Best Damn Vegan Biscuits– a reader favorite. I made a few modifications, including a thicker vegan “buttermilk” of coconut milk instead of almond milk. And I made them gluten-free with a mix of my gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and cornstarch.
The result is a seriously fluffy, tender shortcake that’s perfect for strawberries and coconut whipped cream.

These shortcakes bake up beautifully. I was so happy to see them rise well and brown on the outside. They formed a nice crust on the outside (swoon!), yet remained tender and fluffy on the inside.
All that’s left to do is let these babies cool. Then we get to the important part: toppings!

For toppings, I went withCoconut Whipped Cream and strawberries sprinkled with cane sugar.
But I also tried them later with grilled peaches (!!) and dairy-free ice cream! Both were delicious – you really can’t go wrong with toppings here.

I hope you all LOVE this shortcake! It’s:
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
Vegan &amp; Gluten-Free
&amp; Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect summertime dessert. I brought mine along to a BBQ and they were gone in minutes – a non gluten-free crowd no less!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and grease a baking sheet.In a measuring cup or small mixing bowl, combine coconut milk, lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, and vanilla (optional). Stir to combine and set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, cornstarch, organic cane sugar, sea salt, and baking powder and whisk to combine. Add the coconut oil and use a pastry cutter, whisk, or fork to ""cut"" the oil into the flour until small bits remain.Add ¾ of the coconut buttermilk to the dry mixture and stir with a spoon to combine. You're looking for a semi-sticky dough, and you may not use all of the coconut milk. I used all but 1-2 Tbsp (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).If your mixture looks too dry, add more coconut milk. If it looks too wet, compensate with 1-2 Tbsp at a time of almond flour or gluten-free flour blend. (see photo)Transfer your dough onto a well (gluten-free) floured surface and dust the top with a little gluten-free flour. Handling as little as possible, form into a 1-inch-thick disc with your hands. Then using a well-floured biscuit or cookie cutter (or narrow drinking glass), cut out circles and transfer carefully to a greased baking sheet (arranging the shortcakes so they touch - see photo). Continue, reforming dough as needed, until all of the dough is used - about 6 shortcakes (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Brush the tops of the shortcakes with coconut milk or melted coconut oil and sprinkle with a bit more cane sugar. Oil will help them form more of a crust, whereas coconut milk will help the biscuits remain a bit more moist. Both work great!Bake at 400 F for 15-17 minutes or until the outside is crisp and they are beginning to brown slightly. Then increase heat to 450 F (232 C) and bake for another 3-5 minutes to brown the outside (see photo). Watch carefully and be sure not to burn.During this time, you can prepare your Coconut Whipped Cream (optional) and slice your strawberries. Sprinkle strawberries with sugar or stevia to sweeten + help create a sauce (optional).Remove biscuits from oven and let cool 5 minutes. Then carefully separate the shortcakes so they can cool completely. It's important to let these cool and the steam to release or they can be a bit on the moist side. Room temperature is best for serving.To serve, carefully slice shortcakes in half (optional) and top with sliced strawberries and coconut whipped cream or ice cream.Best when fresh. Store leftover shortcakes covered at room temperature for 3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
222,Green Spirulina Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Green Spirulina Smoothie (5 Ingredients!)

Summer is creepin’ on and I’m craving fresh, green things, like this green spirulina smoothie.
What makes it super green? We’re about to find out. Shall we?

This smoothie is about as easy as it gets: 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, 1 blender.
The base is frozen banana, cucumber (we learned about cucumber’s health benefitsin my Cucumber Smoothie), and coconut milk. I include hemp seed as an optional addition for healthy fats and protein. And last but not least, spirulina!
I asked you guys on Twitter if you’d be interested in seeing any recipes with spirulina, and you said yes! I’ve included tips on where to buy and how to use it in the notes.

Spirulina is an extremely nutritious blue-greenalgaethat’s high in Bvitaminsand minerals like iodine, beta-carotene, antioxidants, iron, and manganese. It’s also 60% protein and a complete protein, containing all essential amino acids – 1 Tablespoon boasts 4 g protein.
So what’s the big deal? Spirulina is a very concentrated source of vitamins and minerals and also very detoxifying and alkalizing to the body, which is why it’s considered a “super food” in many circles. I’ve been incorporating it mainly into my smoothies and loveits intense color, neutral flavor, and health benefits. It’s a great way to get a green smoothie without adding handfuls of kale.
What does it taste like? Eaten directly, it has a somewhat unpleasant taste – kind of like seaweed. But, when thrown into smoothies or desserts, it’s undetectable. Huzzah!

I hope you all LOVE this gorgeous smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Bright green
Perfectly sweet
Insanely nutritious
Quick + Easy
Portable
&amp; Delicious
This smoothiemakes the perfect plant-based breakfast or snack. For even more protein, add more hemp seeds, chia seeds, or your favorite vegan protein powder. And don’t forget your toppings! I went for blueberries, hemp seeds, and granola (which was inspired by my girl @shutthekaleup!).
For more smoothies spirulina would pair well with, check out our Hide Your Kale Smoothie, 5-Ingredient Detox Smoothie, Ginger Colada Green Smoothie, andCreamy Cucumber Pineapple Smoothie!

","To a blender*, add frozen banana, cucumber, coconut milk, spinach, spirulina, and hemp seed (optional). Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides (or using smoothie wand) as needed.If too thick, thin with water or more coconut milk. If too thin, thicken with ice or more frozen banana. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana for sweetness, cucumber for freshness, or greens or spirulina for green color. See note about spirulina (brands + how much to add).Serve immediately as is or in my preferred: top with blueberries, granola, and more hemp seeds. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 2 days or the freezer for 1 week. Thaw to enjoy from freezer."
223,Roasted Jalapeño Vegan Queso | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Jalapeño Vegan Queso (7 ingredients!)
All aboard the queso train – toot toot!
Did you like my cheesy joke? (Get it? Cheesy cuz it’s…queso?)
But, in all seriousness, soak some cashews, roast your peppers, and ready your chips, folks. We’re making vegan queso.

I’ve made vegan queso before, bothfrom eggplant and from a semi-classic “roux” of garlic, oil, starch, and almond milk. But I had yet to tackle cashew queso.
However,after a trip to one of my favorite Portland eateries – Prasad – my friend Jeanette ordered their roasted jalapeño queso and insisted I try it.Things haven’t been the same since. I had to remake this queso.
My version is easy, requiring just 7 ingredients and a little over 1 hour to make. Plus, it’s oil-free for those of you avoiding oil, yet it remains ridiculously creamy thanks to the soaked cashews.
The “cheesy” flavor primarily comes from nutritional yeast, which also adds a hefty serving of B vitamins and a gorgeous golden hue. It’s what we call a win-win situation.
I hope you all LOVE this “cheese” sauce! It’s:
Creamy
Smoky
Spicy
Super flavorful
Rich
Cheesy
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect sauce to add to things like tacos, burritos, enchiladas, nachos, and more. It’s also delicious with straight-up tortilla chips – you can’t beat a classic.
If you give this recipe a try, let us know how it goes! Leave a comment below, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Be sure to soak your cashews overnight in cool water or in very hot water for 1 hour before starting this recipe. Drain and then proceed with recipe.Preheat oven to medium broil and add jalapeños to a baking sheet. Broil on the top oven rack for 4-7 minutes or until slightly blackened on the outside. Wrap in foil to steam for a few minutes. Then carefully peel outside skin away and remove any seeds/stems. (Note: Be sure to wash your hands after peeling to avoid getting any lingering heat on your skin or your eyes.)Add soaked, drained cashews and jalapeños to a blender along with nutritional yeast, water, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and hot sauce (optional).Blend, adding more water as needed to create a creamy, pourable cheese sauce. Scrape down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for depth of flavor and cheesiness, remaining jalapeńo or chili powder for heat, cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or hot sauce for additional heat.Serve immediately. Will be fine at room temperature for several hours. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave."
224,Vegan Breakfast Burrito With Scrambled Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Scrambled Tofu Breakfast Burrito (30 minutes!)
Ah, the vegan breakfast burrito – a thing to behold.
While we have a veganburrito in our cookbook, I’d yet to make one with tofu. And, truth be told, this version is a bit easier to make. No rice, no beans, no slaw. Just spiced, scrambled tofu, roasted vegetables, ripe avocado, and a sauce of your choice.
Now that you’re imagining yourself with a vegan breakfast burrito in hand, let’s get to it!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish. And the ingredients are things you likely have on hand right now! The only thing I didn’t have was tortillas, which can be subbed with many things to keep this recipe gluten-free, such as corn tortillas, gluten-free wraps, or collard greens.
While red peppers and potatoes roast away, scramble up some extra-firm tofu with smoky spices like cumin, chili powder, and garlic. Nutritional yeast and hummus add a bit of “umami” to the tofu that I just love. Nutritional yeastseems to have that effect in recipes.

All that’s left to do is wrap! Simply pile as many toppings as you can fit into a tortilla and roll away. If you’ve ever watched the burrito artists at Chipotle do this, you know it’s possible but not easy. You really have to roll and tuck to get everything inside. But trust me – the end result is worth it.
I hope you all LOVE these burritos! They’re:
Saucy
Smoky
Flavorful
Fast
Healthy
&amp; So delicious
These would make a delicious on-the-go breakfast for kids in the morning or for weekend adventuring like hiking or picnics. They’re delicious on their own, but they are also tasty served with leftover breakfast potatoes, fruit,pinto beans, or Crispy Hash Browns.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (use more baking sheets if increasing batch size). In the meantime, also wrap tofu in a clean towel and set something heavy on top - such as a cast-iron skillet - to press out excess moisture. Then crumble with a fork into fine pieces. Set aside.Add potatoes and red pepper to the baking sheet, drizzle with oil (or water) and spices, and toss to combine. Bake for 15-22 minutes or until fork tender and slightly browned. Add kale in the last 5 minutes of baking to wilt, tossing with the other vegetables to combine seasonings.In the meantime, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water), garlic, and tofu and sauté for 7-10 minutes, stirring frequently, to slightly brown.In the meantime, to a small mixing bowl, add the hummus, chili powder, cumin, nutritional yeast, salt, and cayenne (optional). Stir to combine. Then add water until a pourable sauce is formed (1-3 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then add parsley and stir. Add the spice mixture to the tofu and continue cooking over medium heat until slightly browned - ~3-5 minutes. Set aside.Assemble burritos: Roll out a large tortilla. Add generous portions of the roasted vegetables, scrambled tofu, avocado, cilantro, and a bit of salsa. Roll up and place seam side down (you can wrap in foil to keep warm - optional). Continue until all toppings are used up - about 3-4 large burritos.Enjoy immediately for best results. Alternatively, you can package and refrigerate these up to 4 days (or the freezer for 1 month). Just microwave or heat in the oven before eating (be sure to remove foil if heating in microwave)."

If you follow uson Instagram, you know I’ve been lovingthese banana walnut pancakes from Harlow. In fact, I think they’re what helped me survive our dreary Oregon winter. If I had pancakes to look forward to on Friday mornings, I could make it through the week.
Pancakes are, after all, how my mom used to coax me out of bed as a young child. The obsession continues into adulthood. Thanks, Ma!

After posting these beauties to Instagram, one of the restaurant owners graciously reached out and pointed me in the direction of the recipe. I forgot to ask her if we could be best friends. I’ll keep you posted on the status of our relationship.
I did a little tweaking to the recipe and the result was perfect. These pancakes are easy to make, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish. By the end, you’ll have a mound of delicious, fluffy pancakes to devour. Hello, perfect lazy weekend breakfast.
How are theselife-changing, you ask? They’re completely vegan and gluten-free, made with wholesome ingredients, naturally sweetened, and SO dang delicious. Trust the pancake queen – you need thesein your life.

The base of these beauties is oat flour – 2 whole cups – gluten-free flour, and almond flour. In my experience, oat flour is the best way to keep pancakes gluten free, wholesome, and fluffy!
Next comes two whole bananas mashed, dairy-free milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and coconut oil. I’ll leave modifications in the notes if you can’t tolerate oil, oats, or nuts.

Carefully flip pancakes and cook until browned on the underside (~2 minutes more).Transfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet or plate and keep warm in a 200-degree F (94 C) oven. Continue cooking until all batter is used up - about 14-16 pancakes (as original recipe is written).These pancakes are delicious on their own, but they're amplified with vegan butter or peanut butter, sliced bananas, granola, flaked coconut, and maple syrup. Store cooled leftover pancakes (without toppings) in a container separated with wax or parchment paper to prevent sticking. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the toaster oven or oven until hot."
226,Golden Turmeric Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Golden Goddess (Turmeric) Hummus

You know golden milk, right?
Well, have you met her cousin golden hummus? She’s sort of a diva. She goes by goddess because she’s so vibrant in color and boasts mad anti-inflammatory effects. Give her a crown already (or at least a carrot). Also, you should totally invite her over because she might just change your life.

Golden goddess hummus? Yes, it’s a thing. When your food has fiber, protein, plant power, andtons of anti-inflammatory perks, you can call it a goddess. I checked (sorta).
This 9-ingredient, 10-minute hummus gets its gorgeous golden hue from digestion-promotingfresh ginger, a pinch of metabolism-boosting cayenne pepper, and a generous sprinkle of both fresh and ground turmeric – the ultimate beauty spice.
A little lemon adds brightness, tahini adds creaminess, and salt amplifies the flavor of this dreamy hummus. Trust me, this is your new go-to dip.

I hope you all LOVE this hummus! It’s:
Creamy
Flavorful
Subtly spiced
Super healthy
Quick + Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect side or snack when you’re in a hurry but need something satisfyingandnutritious. It’s so tastywith fresh vegetables, flatbread, pita chips, or even vegan naan! It would also be a delicious sandwich spread for things like my Vegan BLT or Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich.

","Add drained chickpeas, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric, ground turmeric, salt, and cayenne (optional) to a blender or food processor and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides needed.To create a creamier texture, add a bit of oil and/or (if avoiding oil) water. (I used 1 Tbsp oil and 2 Tbsp water).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic or ginger for spice/zing, lemon juice for acidity, salt for saltiness, grated turmeric for earthiness, or cayenne for spice. I added a bit more ground turmeric, lemon juice, and salt.Serve as is or garnish with pine nuts, sesame seeds, or more spices. Parsley would also be a nice addition. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days."
227,Vegetable Pakoras (Gluten-Free and Vegan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mixed Vegetable Pakoras (30 minutes!)

Have you ever had a pakora? If not, you’re missing out.
Think crispy, golden, battered, and pan-fried vegetables with big curryflavor. They’re similar to a classic onion ring but somehow better. And you can use just about any vegetable you have on hand. However,I’ve found this combo to be best.
I even include my go-to, 5-minute green chutney dipping sauce. Shall we?

This recipe comes together in 30 minutes! And the ingredients aresimple. The only thing you may have to get is chickpea flour, which I’m realizing is quite useful to have around for gluten-free cooking.
The batter is a mixture of water, chickpea flour (which makes this recipe vegan and gluten-free!), and spices. And, for the vegetables, I went with thinly sliced red onion, yellow potatoes, and cauliflower. I also tested red bell peppers and zucchini but didn’t enjoy quitethem as much.

Let’s talk cooking methods. I know that some of you are going to prefer a baked (low-fat) method, which I include in the notes.
But, in my opinion, pakoras are an occasional treat worth splurging on.I highly recommend going for pan-fried, which doesn’t call for too much oil. The texture is noticeably crispier, the overall flavor is better, and the cooking process goesmuch faster.
However, if you’d rather go oil-free, baking is great too. While your pakoras are crisping up, all that’s left to do is make my 5-minute, go-to green chutney, which makes this recipe in my opinion. Who wants a naked pakora? Not I.

I hope you LOVE these pakoras! They’re:
Simple
Crispy
Subtly spiced
So flavorful
Easy to make
&amp; Delicious
These would make the perfect snack or side to dishes like my 1-Pot Sweet Potato Kale Curry, Coconut Red Curry with Chickpeas, Yellow Curry with Mango, or 1-Pot Lentil Dal. For more curry snacks, check out my Curried Cashews, Red Curry Cauliflower Wings, or Samosa Potato Cakes.

*Consider this my inspired version of pakoras! I rarely go to the most traditional route when testing my recipes and make substitutions and modifications where I feel it benefits the flavor and texture while keeping special dietary needs in mind.
","Add onion, cauliflower, and potato to a large mixing bowl and season with salt, cayenne, garam masala, curry powder, garlic, and minced cilantro. Toss and set aside.To a separate mixing bowl, add chickpea flour and water and stir until a pourable, pancake-like batter is achieved. Then pour over the vegetables and toss to coat. There should be plenty of batter to generously coat the vegetables. If not, mix together bit more batter and pour over the vegetables.If serving with chutney, prepare at this time by adding all ingredients to a food processor or small blender and blend until well combined, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic for kick/zing, salt for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, pepper for heat, or maple syrup for sweetness. Transfer to a serving vessel and set aside.Heat 2 large skillets over medium high heat (see notes for baking instructions). Once hot, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan and let the oil warm. Add the coated vegetables one at a time, grouping the onions together in small bunches so they cook together (see photo). Reduce heat to low and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. If cooking too quickly, reduce heat to medium / medium-low. Repeat.As the pakoras are cooked, placed on a paper-towel-lined serving plate and set in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm. Repeat until all pakoras are cooked.Serve with chutney and rice (optional), and garnish with fresh cilantro (also optional). Best when fresh. Store leftovers in a well-covered container in the refrigerator up to 2 days. Reheat in a hot skillet or in a 400 degree F (204 C) oven until warmed through."
228,Easy Vegan Naan | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Naan

For as much Indian food as we eat in our home (takeout and homemade), it was about time I knew how to make a good vegan naan. I’ve been working on this recipe for a while now, and it’s finally ready to be released into the world!
I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how easy it is to throw together. Let’s do this!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 basic ingredients you likely have on hand right now. And the method iseasier than baking a loaf of bread. There’s hardly any kneading; just mix, rise, roll, and cook on the stovetop.
You’re so close to having fresh naan at your fingertips. Can you feel it?

This recipe is plant-based but not gluten-free. I tested many gluten-free versionS but couldn’t get them to where I wanted. But, if you give this recipe a try with gluten-free flours, let me know how it goes in the comments!

I hope you all LOVE this naan. It’s:
Tender
Fluffy
Flavorful
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect snack or side to dishes like my Spicy Red Lentil Curry, Lentil Dal,Sweet Potato Kale Curry, or Chana Masala. I could also see this working well as a wrapwithcrispy chickpeasor as flatbread for a quick pizza. And I wouldn’tjudge you if you just slathered it in peanut butter and jelly and went to town (Minimalist Baker approved).

","Measure out warm water (3/4 cup as original recipe is written // ~110 degrees F or 43 C to properly activate yeast) and add yeast and sugar. Stir and set aside until frothy and foamy - about 10 minutes.In the meantime, add flour(s), salt, and baking powder to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.Once the yeast mixture is foaming, add the vegan yogurt and oil* and stir to combine. Add to dry ingredients and use a fork to mix - the dough will be sticky.Turn onto a floured surface and add just enough flour to gently knead for 5 turns and form into a loose ball. Place back in mixing bowl and rub with a bit more oil and turn to coat. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place for at least 2 hours (up to 4 hours). (I like setting it in a sunny spot in the kitchen or in the laundry room.)Remove dough from bowl and turn onto a floured surface. Knead for 30 seconds (adding additional flour if sticky). Then divide into 6 even pieces with hands or a knife.Lightly knead each ball until it forms a loose ball (15 seconds) and set on a clean surface. Repeat until all dough is formed into balls. Then cover with plastic wrap again and let rest for 10 minutes.In the meantime, prepare any garnishes for topping (i.e. melted vegan butter or coconut oil, sea salt, minced garlic, or cilantro).Once the dough has rested, begin heating a cast-iron pan (not non-stick) over medium heat. Take a piece of dough and lay it on a floured surface. Then roll out into an oval or circle with a rolling pin. Carefully flip over and pat the dough with a bit of water so it doesn’t stick to the pan. At this time, press the garlic and cilantro onto one side so it sticks. Then place the wet-side down on the hot pan.Cook for 1 minute or until the edges of the dough look dry and it’s beginning to bubble. Then flip the dough with a spatula and cook until the underside is dark brown. If using a gas range, you can put the naan directly over the flame when cooking the second side, but be careful, as it goes fast and the naan can burn much more easily.Repeat until all naan is cooked. Then brush with melted vegan butter or coconut oil and sprinkle with cilantro and sea salt (optional). Serve immediately.Cover leftovers and store at room temperature for about 2 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through."
229,Easy Chickpea Scramble | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Chickpea Scramble (30 minutes!)

Chickpea scramble! Ever tried one?
It’s the perfect solution when you want something egg scramble-like without eggs or tofu (no shade on tofu, but some folks avoid soy, so this is another workaround).
Chickpeas are a delicious source of plant-based protein and fiber,andthey take on flavors well. The only “problem” with chickpeas as a base is 1) they don’t bind together well,and 2) they don’t quite emulate the fluffy texture of eggs or tofu.
To the drawing board I went. I experimented, I asked your guys’ opinion on Twitter and Instagram, and I experimented some more. And onesuggestion – eggplant – was the golden ticket!

This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make! I even include some workarounds that make it even faster + easierif you’re short on time.
The “secret” to this scramble is baba ganoush, which whips up in less than 15 minutes. It’s what helps bind the chickpeas together whilealso providing provide flavor, creaminess, and a bit of fluffiness!
Eggplant for the win, once again.

While the eggplant is roasting, season your chickpeas! I went with a healthy mix of turmeric (an amazing anti-inflammatory!), ginger (great for digestion), and cumin (also helpful for digestion).
A pinch of salt, pepper, and smoked paprikabring even more flavor to this delicious and wholesome scramble.

I hope you all LOVE this scramble! It’s:
Fluffy
Flavorful
Wholesome
Satisfying
Easy to make
&amp; Super tasty
This would make the perfect breakfast or lunch when you’re craving something satisfying yet healthy. While it does require 30 minutes from scratch, you can usestore-bought baba ganoush to cut that down to 10-15 minutesor make the seasoned chickpeas and baba ganoushahead of time to throw into the skillet throughout the week!

","If using store-bought baba ganoush, skip this step. Otherwise, preheat oven to high broil, move a rack to the top of the oven, and line a baking sheet with foil (foil is best for broiling as parchment paper can burn).Slice the eggplant and arrange on foil-lined baking sheet. Lightly drizzle both sides with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Then broil for 2-3 minutes on each side, watching carefully as it can burn easily. You're going for a deep golden brown, not black.Remove from oven and stack the eggplant. Fold the foil around the eggplant to steam for 5 minutes.In the meantime, add chickpeas and 2-3 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of their cooking liquid to a shallow mixing bowl. To a separate small mixing bowl, add turmeric, cumin, ginger, paprika, salt, pepper, and water to thin and mix into a pourable paste. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more spices for flavor or salt for saltiness.Pour spice mixture over the chickpeas and mash half of them with a fork, evenly distributing the spices until the chickpeas are coated. Sprinkle the chickpeas with a bit more salt for flavor. Set aside.Unwrap the eggplant and peel off most the skin - if well steamed, it should peel right off. Don't fuss too much about getting all of the skin off - a little bit is fine!Transfer eggplant to a food processor (or mixing bowl) and add lemon juice, tahini, garlic, and another healthy pinch of salt. Blend (or mash/whisk) until a paste is formed (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for acidity, garlic for zing/spice, tahini for creaminess, or salt for saltiness. Set aside.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp (15 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) oil and chickpeas. Stir to coat and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add desired amount of baba ganoush - 4-6 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Stir to combine and cook for 3-4 minutes more or until the scramble is slightly drying out and taking on a golden-brown color. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more fresh garlic for garlic flavor/zing, salt for saltiness, or pepper for a little heat. You can also add more baba ganoush for fluffy texture + flavor.Serve the chickpea scramble as is or with desired garnishes / sides. I love roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, cilantro, and extra baba ganoush on the side. Hot sauce is also delicious.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave until warm."

The ultimate plant-based salad is happening. You need this recipein your life.

This saladis simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare.
I hemmed and hawed as to whether or not include both of the dressingsfor this salad. And, after experimentation, I concludedthat both are necessary!

The base of this saladis crunchy kale dressed in a light tahini-lemon-maple dressing. Next comes cooked lentils for plenty of plant-based protein and fiber.
While that’s happening, vegetables tossed in curry powder are roastedaway to perfection and my NEW favorite dressing ismade.
The base is my Green Curry Pastethinned with lemon juice and sweetened with maple syrup. The result is a tangy, sweet, insanely vibrant curry dressing that’s perfect for everything – especially this salad.

I have a thing for curry (exhibitsA, B, C, D, andE). That is the understatement of the year.
I am totally obsessed with curry! The flavor, the aroma, the versatility – I’m hooked.
Since I figured out a DIY curry powder, I figured it was due time I made my own curry paste. Yes, a real jedi-level move. Be impressed.
Friends, I have to say I don’t know what took me so long to try this recipe, because homemade is sooooo much better than store-bought. And it’s easy. Let’s do this!

This recipe requires just 10 minutes to make and 1 food processor or blender.
Just throw all the ingredients in and blend – that’s it! And it makes the most insanely gorgeous green curry paste that tastes incredible.
The base of the paste is green chilies, ginger (or galangal), onion, garlic, and green bell pepper. Flavor comes from a mixture of spices you likely have on hand, lemon juice, and lime zest. If you’re missing a spice or two, don’t be discouraged! As long as you have most of the ingredients, it should turn out well for you.
The other benefit of making your own is you can leave things out if they don’t appeal to you, such as less chilies for a milder curry or more ginger for extra gingery curries!


I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Zesty
Gingery

234,Grilled Jamaican Jerk Eggplant | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Jamaican Jerk Grilled Eggplant (30 Minutes!)

If you like spicy, saucy food, this recipe is for you. And seeing as we are about to enter grilling season (at least in the Pacific Northwest!), it’s the perfect time for another a grillable plant-based recipe.
Shall we?

The inspiration for this recipe came from Jamaican jerk chicken. It’s been so long since I’ve had that dish, but I’ve always been drawn to smoky, spicy, earthy foods. Jerk seasoning fits all of those categories.
This recipe requires 30 minutes from start to finish, and hopefully you have all theingredients you needin your pantryright now! Don’t sweat it if you’re missing a couple of spices. If you’re checking most the boxes, you’re good!


Eggplant is sliced into thick “steaks” and generously brushed with your jerk marinade, which is comprised of tamari, coconut sugar, fresh ginger, garlic, lime juice, chilies, onion, and an array of spices like cinnamon, coriander, and cayenne.
The result is a sauce with BIG flavor that soaks right into the eggplant before they’re grilled to perfection. Mmmm.

For serving, I went for rice (you could also use cauliflower rice!). And I even whipped up an impromptu dippingsauce for serving, which is entirely optional but adds another wave of flavor I adore to this dish.
I hope you LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Hearty
Smoky
Spicy
Tender
Healthy
Quick + easy
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect plant-based dish for grilling this spring and summer. If you don’t have a grill, don’tworry! I relied on my grill pan, which worked just as well without all of the fuss of firing up the grill.

The base is fresh basil, pine nuts, and garlic with a splash of lemon juice for acidity and brightness.
For that cheesy color and flavor, I rely on nutritional yeast, which is a man-made yeast that’s extremely high in B12 (a vitamin especially important for vegans).
Now, we have a paste, but to make it a sauce, I rely on a mix of extra virgin olive oil and water. If you’re trying to avoid oil, feel free to sub the EVOO for vegetable broth or water!

I hope you all love this pesto! It’s:
Creamy
Zesty
Cheesy
Garlicky
Healthy
&amp; SOeasy to make
I love adding pesto to things like white pasta sauce, breadsticks, salad dressings, sauces, and more! This recipe yields about 1 cup, and I’m always surprised how quickly I use it up throughout the week. It also freezes well in ice cube trays, so you can thaw and use a small amount whenever a recipe calls for pesto.

","To a food processor or small blender, add the basil, nuts, garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt and blend/mix on high until a loose paste forms.Add olive oil a little at a time (streaming in while the machine is on if possible) and scrape down sides as needed. Then add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water at a time until the desired consistency is reached - a thick but pourable sauce. (If avoiding oil altogether, sub the oil with vegetable broth or just use all water.)Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for overall flavor, nuts for nuttiness, garlic for bite / zing, or lemon juice for acidity.Perfect for adding to sauces, dressings, breads, and more! My favorite recently has been adding it straight to zucchini or carrot noodles (see photo) for a beautiful, healthy side dish.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week. After that, pour into ice cube molds, freeze, and store up to 1 month or more."
236,White Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs

Vegan white chocolate strikes again! This time in peanut butter form.
It is that time of year when peanut butter eggs are haunting youat the grocery store, eyeing you in the checkout line, begging to be bought up by the dozens.
But resist! Not only do I have aDark Chocolate Peanut Butter Egg recipe (yes, dreams do come true), I also now have a white chocolate version! Is this cause for celebration or what?

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and ~45 minutes to prepare.
The base is peanut butter naturally sweetened with maple syrup and thickened with almond meal (see our Recipe FAQ and the notes for substitutions) before being shaped into “eggs.”
Pop theminto the freezer and it’s onto the good stuff: vegan white chocolate!

The shell is adapted from my 5-Ingredient Vegan White Chocolate Truffles, which are comprisedof macadamia nuts, shredded coconut, and cocoabutter.
The shell is also naturally sweetened and comes together in about 5 minutes! Once your coating is made, it’s time to dip (you dip, I dip, we dip – yes, I did just make an awesome ’90s reference. You’re welcome).

I hope you all LOVE these eggs! They’re:
Tender
Peanut buttery
White chocolate-coated
Naturally sweetened
Easy to make
Surprisingly wholesome
&amp; SO delicious!
These eggs would make the perfect treat for Easter and springtime celebrations! I could also see these making an appearance at baby and bridal showers (and beyond). They are undetectably vegan and gluten-free and masquerade as an indulgent treatthat’s actually healthy (my favorite kind of dessert).

","Add peanut butter to a medium mixing bowl along with maple syrup and stir to combine. This should thicken the peanut butter, depending on the quality/brand of peanut butter you're using.Add almond meal according to how thick the mixture is. If still runny, you may need to add 1 cup (or slightly more). If thick, start with 2/3 cup (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You're going for a thick, moldable dough that's still moist.Use a cookie scoop or Tablespoon (I like this scoop) to scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (see photo)) and gently form into a disc/egg shape. Set on a parchment-lined dish or baking sheet and continue until all dough is formed - about 14-15 eggs (amount as original recipe is written).Transfer to the freezer to chill while making the white chocolate shell.Add macadamia nuts and desiccated coconut to a food processor and blend/mix on high until a smooth paste forms, scraping down sides as needed. Then add melted cocoa butter, maple syrup (or powdered sugar), vanilla, and sea salt (optional). Mix once more to combine.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup (or powdered sugar) for sweetness, vanilla for vanilla flavor, or salt for saltiness. Set aside.Once the peanut butter eggs are slightly firm to the touch, remove from freezer and use a spoon or a fork to gently dip the eggs in white chocolate, making sure all sides are coated. Then tap off excess and return to parchment-lined dish or baking sheet. Repeat until all eggs are dipped. Then place the eggs back in the freezer to set.Once the shell is firm to the touch, remove from freezer and dip the eggs once more (repeating the process above). This makes the shell more opaque and thick, which makes the eggs easier to handle and package. Then place back in the freezer to set once more.Enjoy immediately! Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month."
237,Easy Vegan Golden Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Vegan Golden Milk

We’ve been digging golden milk for a while now, so it was due time to share my go-to recipe.
If you haven’t tried golden milk yet, you’re missing out! It’s a creamy (dairy-free), hot milk drink that’s filled to the brim with nutrients.
Yes, a delicious beverage with health benefits. Dreams do come true.

My version is inspired by the lovely Nutrition Strippedand requires just 8ingredients, 1 pot, and 5 minutes.We’ve been making McKel’sversion for quite some time now with a few modifications, and it’s now a daily obsession.
I’ve found that using a mix of light (canned) coconut milk and unsweetened almond milk creates the perfect creamy base. I’ve tried using both fresh and ground turmeric and have tosay ground is better in terms of flavor!
Coconut oil adds a touch of healthy fat and makes the turmeric more available for our bodies to absorb because it is fat-soluble. So don’t skip the oil! And by some wizardry, black pepper also makes the curcumin in turmeric more bioavailable, so it’s an important addition as well.
To sweeten, you can go any number of ways. I typically go for a spoonful of maple syrup, and if it still needs some sweetness, a dash of stevia is perfect.


I hope you all love our go-to Golden Milk! It’s:
Creamy
Comforting
Coconutty
Turmeric + ginger-infused
Slightly spicy
Perfectly sweet
Super healthy
&amp; Delicious
This is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up when you need something to tide you over till dinner. The health perks alone have made it a daily ritual for us. Anything anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich is a win in my book.
This drinkisdelicious on its own, but it pairs especiallywell with treats like Blueberry Muffin Breakfast Cookies and 1-Bowl Carrot AppleMuffins. And if you’re into golden milk, be sure to check out our Golden Milk Ice Cream and Dark Chocolate Golden Milk Macaroons!

","To a small saucepan, add coconut milk, almond milk, ground turmeric, ground ginger, cinnamon stick, coconut oil, black pepper, and sweetener of choice (I usually add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Whisk to combine and warm over medium heat. Heat until hot to the touch but not boiling - about 4 minutes - whisking frequently.Turn off heat and taste to adjust flavor. Add more sweetener to taste or more turmeric or ginger for intense spice + flavor.Serve immediately, dividing between two glasses and leaving the cinnamon stick behind. Best when fresh, though leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or microwave until hot."
238,Healthy Almond Butter Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Butter Tofu Stir-Fry

If you’ve ever tried my recipe forHow to Make Tofu Taste Good(or the new quicker method),you’ve likely fallen in love with tofu.
Prior to discovering this method – which crisps the tofu up in the oven without any oilor cornstarch – I wasn’t a big fan of tofu. But it’s since become my tried-and-true method for pretty much all things tofu!
The baking method works beautifully in this simple, 9-ingredient vegetable stir-fry infused with almond butter for added protein and nuttiness. Shall we?

This is my new favorite stir-fry recipe because it is so easy to make, is ready in less than 1 hour, and packs plenty of plant-based protein and fiber.
Baked tofu is marinatedin sesame oil, tamari, lime juice, chili garlic sauce, maple syrup, and almond butter, which acts as an extremelyflavorful sauce for the rest of the stir-fry.

Once the tofu is marinated, all that’s left to do is stir-fry the tofu and veggies!
I went with green beans and cherry bomb peppers, but you could use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I think zucchini,asparagus, or even sweet potato would be delicious!

I’m in love with this recipe! It’s:
Simple
Flavorful
Easy to make
Protein-rich (22 g protein / serving!)
Salty-sweet
Perfectlyspiced
&amp; SO delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something hearty yethealthy. It’s extremely customizable: Sub peanut butter for almond butter, cauliflower rice for brown rice, or whatever seasonal vegetablesyou have on hand. And it storeswell, makingit perfect for leftovers the next day!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Also wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top - like a cast-iron skillet - to press out excess moisture.Once oven is preheated, unwrap tofu and cut into small cubes. Arrange on the lined baking sheet in an even layer and bake for 25-30 minutes or until puffy, dried out, and slightly crispy on the edges (see photo). This step helps crisp up the tofu. The longer you bake it, the firmer and crispier it will get, so adjust cooking time accordingly.In the meantime, to a small mixing bowl, add half of the sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), tamari, maple syrup, almond butter, lime juice, and chili garlic sauce/red pepper flake/Thai chilies. Whisk to combine. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more almond butter for creaminess / nuttiness, tamari for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, or chili garlic sauce for heat. Set aside.If serving with rice, prepare at this time (see notes).Add baked tofu to the almond butter-tamari sauce and let marinate for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it marinates, the more intense the flavor, but I find 5-10 minutes to be sufficient.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the tofu, leaving most of the marinade behind (this will be added to the vegetables for flavor).Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides and slightly caramelized. Remove from pan and set aside.To the skillet, add remaining sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), green beans and peppers and 2-3 Tbsp (30-45 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the marinade. Cover to steam for about 4-5 minutes or until green beans are slightly tender. Then remove lid, increase heat to medium high, and add remaining marinade and the tofu. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then remove from heat.Serve as is or over cooked rice or cauliflower rice. For more heat, serve with chili garlic sauce or Sriracha.Best when fresh. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave until hot."
239,Healthy Peanut Butter Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Peanut Butter Fudge (4 Ingredients!)

Peanut. Butter. Fudge.
Yes, I’m on a fudge kick,and no one is gonna stop me.

This fudge was inspired by its chocolate fudge cousin and is somehow even easier to make. Probably because it only requires 4 ingredients and 30 minutes to make.
And yes! It’s still naturally sweetened and surprisingly healthy for you (hello,protein and healthy fats).
The base is made of coconut flakes whirled into coconut butter (a.k.a. nature’s frosting). Then comes a generous amount of creamy, salted peanut butter and melted coconut oil for a super-creamy texture. I tested the recipe without any coconut oil and must say it lacked that fudgy, creamy texture, so don’t skimp! The fourth ingredient is maple syrup for sweetness (and minerals!), but it could also be subbed for stevia if you’re trying to stay away from added sugar.

The result is this creamy, insanely richpeanut butter fudge that will fool anyone into thinking there’s loads of butter and sugar cloaked inside. But, little do they know, they’re basically eating a superfood.

I know you’re going to LOVE this fudge! It’s:
Peanut buttery
Perfectly (+ naturally) sweet
Fudgy
Rich
Salty-sweet
Quick + easy to make
&amp; Insanely delicious
Keep this fudge on hand when you need a healthier dessert throughout the week. It would also make a lovely gift or carefree dessert for hosting. (Imagine your guests’ faces when you bring out a plate of this fudge – talk about coolest-host-in-town vibes!)

Scrape down sides as needed.Then add peanut butter and melted coconut oil and mix once more. Then add maple syrup 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until desired sweetness is reached. If you add too much maple syrup, the mixture can seize up and get thick. If that happens, thin with a bit more melted coconut oil.Optional: Add sea salt and vanilla and mix once more. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more salt or vanilla for overall flavor or maple syrup or stevia for sweetness.Transfer mixture to lined loaf pan and spread into an even layer.

Sometimes, you just need comfort food in your life. But comfort doesn’t have to meanunhealthy. Such is the case with this healthy yet insanely creamy red pepper tomato soup!
If you have 30 minutes, you can make thissimple, nutrient-rich soup that’s perfect for chillier days or when you just need a comforting bowl of soup. Or if you made a grilled cheeze and need a dipping companion. Either way, we’ve got you covered!

This recipe is inspired by my all-time favorite soup – the Creamy Tomato Bisque from our Everyday Cooking Cookbook!
This version is similar to classic tomato soup with the addition of sweet bell pepper. In place of cream, I rely on coconut milk for subtle sweetness. And the flavor comes from rich tomato paste, garlic powder, dill, and basil. Once it’s blended all up, it takes on a deep red-orange hue and silky-smooth texture.
I could boast about the flavor all day, but it’s also so healthy and healing! Tomatoes are rich in lycopene and bell peppers provide plenty of beta carotene, which are bothfree-radical-fighting antioxidants.

I hope you all LOVE this soup! It’s:
Easy to make
Healthy
Creamy
Flavorful
Comforting
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect stand-alone lighter meal if you topped it with hearty croutons (also in our cookbook) or even baked chickpeas! Garnish with full-fat coconut milk for even more creaminess.

241,Coconut Bacon Collard Greens | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Bacon Collard Greens (15 minutes!)

Collard greens are one seriously underappreciated vegetable (hello, health perks).
I used to overlook them all the time. But, once Ifigured out what to do with them, they became a mainstay in ourkitchen. Let me show you how.

This dish is simple, requiring just 1 pan,20 minutes, and 8 ingredients to make!
My version is modeled after traditional, Southern-stylecollard greens, which typically requirebacon or ham.
Instead, I relied on garlic, Coconut Bacon, and red pepper flake. Coconut sugar brings balance to the dish, while lemon juice is the perfect finishing touch for a bit of acidity and brightness.

Sauté for 3-4 minutes, covered, stirring occasionally until bright green in color and slightly soft.Add coconut bacon, vegetable broth (start with lesser end of range- 3 Tbsp or 45 ml as original recipe is written), a bit more salt and pepper, coconut sugar (start with lesser end of range- 1 tsp as original recipe is written), and red pepper flake. Stir, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 4-6 minutes, stirring occasionally.Continue cooking to desired tenderness. I like mine with a little crunch left, so I leave the vegetable broth at 3-4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), but you could continue adding vegetable broth (up to 6 Tbsp // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and simmer up to 15 minutes for more tender collards.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more coconut sugar for sweetness / flavor balance, salt and pepper for overall flavor, red pepper flake for heat, or more coconut bacon for smokiness and crunch.Serve immediately with additional coconut bacon and a squeeze of lemon juice (optional).

I’m sure by now you’ve tried the 1-ingredient magicthat is banana “soft serve” ice cream?
If not, you must. It’s just frozen, ripe bananas whirled into creamy soft serve. In other words, it’s what a healthy foodie’s dessert dreams are made of.
Flavor options are endless! But, forthis particular recipe, I went with a recent favorite: Chocolate tahini!
It’s no secret that I have a thing for tahini and chocolate. But, when I combined the two in my Tahini Stuffed Dates (aka Tahini Bombs), I lost my mind over the flavor combination. Think savory, sweet, chocolaty, and nutty. It’s a real-life flavorlove affair.
Not only is this recipe delicious, it’s also SO easy to make, requiring just 5-10 minutes, 1 bowl, and 4 ingredients to make!

243,Grain-Free Tabbouleh Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grain-Free Tabbouleh Salad (6 Ingredients!)

I make this salad at least once a week. How amI just now sharing the recipe?
It’s such a healthy, easy, and versatile dish that pairs perfectly with all things Mediterranean. Without further ado, my take on tabbouleh salad!

This recipe is so easy, requiring just 6 ingredients, 10 minutes, and 1 bowl to make.
The base is fresh, chopped parsley, red bell pepper, and red onion. I love eating parsley because it’s so healthy for you (hello, antioxidants) and great at detoxifying the body (especially when you throw in lemon!).
I used to add grains to my salad, but it honestly takes too much time and I don’t feel that it was adding much in the way of texture or flavor. But feel free to add cooked, cooled quinoa, bulgur, or couscous!

Traditional tabbouleh calls fortomato. But, after realizingall I had was red bell pepper one night and using it in its place, I haven’t gone back. It adds even more crunch (plus beta carotene!) and a bit of sweetness, which I love.
And I love that this is another no-mix dressing (i.e. dump the dressing over the salad sans mixing). Keep it easy, folks.
I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s:
Fresh
Crunchy
Citrusy
Mega healthy
Delicious
Versatile
&amp; Easy to make
This salad makes a delicious side to Mediterranean mains like Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes, Chickpea Shawarma Sandwiches, and even Curry Lentil Soup! It also makes a great base for Crispy Baked Chickpeas, Lentil Dip, and Falafel!

This is also great as a salad base for things like Crispy Baked Chickpeas."

Hand raised on all three.
If you answered yeson any one of these, you’ve likely experienced a 7-layer salad. Say hello to its vegan cousin.

This recipe was actually a reader request, and seeing as I just mastered Vegan Mayonnaise and Coconut Bacon (and Eggplant Bacon), I figured it was perfect timing.
If you’ve never had a 7-layer salad (or layered salad, as some knowit), it’s a layeringof lettuce, vegetables, cheese, and bacon. The dressing is typically a mixture of mayonnaise (and oftensour cream), and sugar. Healthy, right? ; )
My version mimics the traditional version, only it subs carrots for cheese, coconut bacon for bacon, and naturally sweetened vegan mayo dressing for mayonnaise and sugar.
Did I mention that this is a 30-minute, 10-ingredient recipe? Because it totally is.

I hope you all LOVE this modern take on a classic. It’s:

245,1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Crackers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Crackers

This recipe is for the carb and cracker lover who is ready to up their game and make their own at home. (Trust me. It’s not as scary as it sounds.)
Or, if you ever make your own almond milk,you likely have leftover pulp! You can put it to good use in these crackers. (Yet another reason to try this recipe.)
What I’m saying is: These delicious crackers make excellentuse of ingredients you likely have in your pantry right now. Shall we?

This recipe requiring just a food processor (or bowl!) and 7 ingredients to make.
The base is gluten-free flour blend and almond meal, and the flavor comes from salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. You could also add a littlenutritional yeast for cheesiness if you’d like (see my Vegan Cheez Its for inspiration).

Next comes oil and water to bring moisture to the dough.
The fat adds a bit of flakiness, and water brings crispiness. A perfect balance of the two makes these crackers easy to roll out and form as well as spot-on in texture.
Once they’re rolled out and sliced, a quick trip to the freezer helps them firm up to make transferring to the baking sheet a breeze. Then just 15-20ish minutes in the oven and BAM! You have homemade crackers on your hands!

I hope you all LOVE these crackers! They’re:
Crispy
Tender
Flavorful
Wholesome
Easy to make
&amp; So delicious
These would make the perfect snack to have on hand during the week. They would be especially delicious with Hummus, Nut Butter, Vegan Nutella (do it), Lentil Dip, Chickpea Shawarma Dip, Spicy Pimento Cheese Ball, orSmoky Harissa Eggplant Dip.

Lay another sheet of parchment paper or wax paper on top and use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle slightly less than 1/8th inch thick (see photo).Use a knife, a pizza cutter, or a small cookie cutter to cut the dough into squares (or circles). Makes about 60 squares (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Transfer the dough (still on the wax paper or parchment) to a baking sheet and pop in the freezer for about 10 minutes to stiffen. This will help them firm up and become easier to transfer to the baking sheet.Once firm, use a spatula to carefully transfer the crackers to the parchment-lined baking sheet(s) in a single layer, making sure they aren’t touching to ensure even baking.Bake for 16-22 minutes or until slightly golden brown (be careful not to burn). Remove from oven and let cool.Enjoy immediately. Store leftovers covered at room temp for up to 1 week or in the freezer for 1 month."
246,How to Make Aquafaba | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"A Guide to Aquafaba

If you’ve found this page you’re likely curious about aquafaba!
What is it?

It’s is the liquid leftover from cooked chickpeas. You can obtain it two ways:

1) Drain a can of chickpeas and reserve the liquid. Or,
2) Cook your own chickpeas and reserve the leftover cooking liquid. The second method is less reliable, in my opinion, because the aquafaba can be too thin and you may need to cook it down, making it more time consuming.


Beginners should rely on aquafaba from canned chickpeas for ease!

How do you whip it?

The trick to whipping aquafaba is using a hand or stand mixer! Whisking it by hand takes quite a long time and does not produce as good of results in my experience. I use this hand mixerand it works like a dream.
Whipping aquafaba generally takes 3-6 minutes to get to semi-firm peaks, depending on your equipment and how thick your aquafaba was to begin with. So take your time and don’t be discouraged if it takes some time to reach stiff peaks! It can requirea little practice and patience.

Tips + Tricks?

My main tip? Buy canned chickpeas instead of making your own from cooked chickeas. My favorite brand is Trader Joe’s Organic Chickpeas.
My next tipis to throw in some cream of tartar, which causes the aquafaba to whip up much easier, faster, and makes the peaks firmer. See it at work in this VIDEO!

﻿
How to Use It?
Aquafaba can be used in a number of ways:

It can be added to recipes unwhippedas an egg binder, such as in these Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookies.It can also be used to makeVegan Mayo!
It can be whipped into semi-stiff peaks and added to recipes as a whipped egg white substitute, such as these Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles!
It can be whipped into stiff peaks and made into things like meringues and macaroons (recipes to come!).

247,Vegan Shamrock Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mint Matcha Shamrock Shake

This is my take on the classic shamrock shake! It’s creamy, minty, refreshing, and way healthier than the original! Plus, just 6 ingredients required, it’s 100% plant-based, and is refined sugar-free. Shall we?

The base is made with frozen coconut milk “ice cubes” blended with almond milk and a dash of coconut cream for thick and creamy texture.
The mint flavor comes from fresh mint (!!) and peppermint extract. A handful of spinach adds some nutrients as well as a vibrant green color.
And the shake is naturally sweetened with maple syrup or stevia.

This shake is:
Icy
Creamy
Perfectly sweet
Minty
Surprisingly healthy
&amp; So easy to make
This is the perfect treat to enjoy on St. Patrick’s Day and beyond! You could even make it boozy with some Irish Whiskey, Bailey’s, or Creme de Menthe (just sayin’.)
For more dairy-free shakes, check out my Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake, Bourbon Pumpkin Milkshake,Banana Split Smoothie, 3-Ingredient Mocha Milkshake, Cold Brew Caramel Frappucino, and Cold Brew Mocha Frappuccino.

","To make coconut ice cubes, pour a can of well-shaken light or full fat coconut milk into an ice cube tray and freeze until firm - 4-6 hours, or overnight.Once frozen, put the coconut ""ice"" cubes into a blender, along with peppermint extract, vanilla extract, fresh mint, matcha powder (optional), coconut cream, lesser amount of almond milk (1/2 cup or 120 ml as original recipe is written), maple syrup, and spinach (optional). Blend on high, scraping down sides as needed, until creamy and smooth.If too thick, thin with a bit more almond milk. If too thin, add a little ice. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more peppermint extract for minty flavor, spinach for green color, or maple syrup for sweetness.Divide between two serving glasses and garnish with fresh mint and cacao nibs (optional). Coconut whipped cream would also be a lovely topping!Best when fresh. Leftovers still keep in the freezer (covered) up to 5 days."
248,Easy Vegan Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Vegan Fudge (30 minutes!)

This recipe tested my patience. I almost threw in the towel. Aren’t you glad I didn’t?

This fudgestarted as avocado truffles, which then morphed into avocado fudge, which inevitably ended up being a flop because, as hard as I tried to ignore it, I could always taste (and smell) the avocado in the background. Back to the drawing board.
Next, I went for a vegan chocolate-inspired approach with cocoa butter and coconut oil. But it ended up a bit too waxy and somewhat oily for my liking. Back to the drawing board (again).
Which brings us to the current magic that is this easy 1-bowl, 30-minute vegan fudgemadewith 8ingredients. Let’s dessert, shall we?


The base for this recipe is coconut, cocoa butter, nut butter, and cacao powder. This creates a fudgy, rich texturewith the perfect amount of chocolate flavor.
This recipe is also naturally sweetened (something I really wanted to hang on to) with maple syrup and chopped dates. It all happens in the food processor before being poured into a pan and frozen.
This recipe is not only easy to make, but also quick and virtually foolproof (the best kind of recipes).

I hope you all LOVE this fudge! It’s:
Rich
Dense
Chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Slightly nutty
Subtly infused with coconut
&amp; Insanely satisfying
This is the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand for a weeknight treat. I keepmine in the fridgeand inevitably end up snacking on a piece after lunch and dinner. It’s that good! It’s like having your daily dose of chocolate that’shomemade, healthier, and refined sugar-free.

","Line a standard 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size).Add coconut to a food processor and mix until a creamy ""butter"" or liquidy paste is formed - about 4 minutes - scraping down sides as needed.Next, add nut butter, melted cocoa butter, cacao powder, maple syrup, sea salt, and vanilla. Mix until thoroughly combined, scraping down sides as needed.Lastly, add chopped (pitted) dates and mix once more to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more vanilla for vanilla flavor, cacao powder for chocolate flavor, maple syrup for sweetness, or nut butter for nuttiness.If the mixture appears too thick, simply thin with a bit more maple syrup or melted cocoa butter! It should be semi-thick but pourable (see photo).Transfer the mixture to the parchment-lined loaf pan and spread into an even layer. Then top with cacao nibs (optional). Loosely cover with plastic wrap or another sheet of parchment paper and freeze until firm to the touch - about 15-20 minutes.Remove from freezer and cut into 21 even squares (or desired number // amount as original recipe is written). Enjoy immediately. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month. Best enjoyed at room temperature."
249,Spicy Vegan Breakfast Sausage | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Tempeh Breakfast Sausage

If you follow us on Instagram, you know I’ve been sitting on this recipe for a while now with ample excitement.
I’d been ponderinghow to make thisrecipe work for weeks, and after finally giving it a try, I’mSO pleased with the results.
If you’re plant-based or trying to eat more that way, this vegan breakfast “sausage” is going to satisfy that savory morning protein craving like no other. Let’s do this!

This recipe does require more ingredients than I typically use, but it’s for a good cause. Every spice adds another layer of flavor to make these undetectably vegan “sausages!” The simple factor comes with the 1-bowl prepto save on dishes and clean up time.
The base of this “sausage” is tempeh, which mocks the texture of sausage perfectly. Next comes a mixture of smoky, sweet, and spicy seasonings like smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Vegan Worcestershire sauce adds a “meaty” flavor, while a bit of oil adds moisture. Garlic and onion add texture and even more flavor.
The fun part is the mixing, which I recommend doing with your hands. You can also do this in the food processor, but I prefer mixing in a bowl so you get more of a chunky mixture and less of a puree. Plus, using your hands is more fun – trust me.
I highly recommend cooking these on the stovetop for a crusty outer edge and a tender middle. But I also tried baking these and it works as well if you’re trying to avoid or cut back on oil. Either way, these “sausages” are a major win!

I hope you all LOVE this sausage! It’s:
Hearty
Super flavorful
Smoky
Spicy
Crisp on the outside
Tender on the inside
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious
These are the perfect breakfast companion for things like my Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble, Breakfast Hash,Simple TofuQuiche, and Crispy Hash BrownHaystacks. Not to worry – I am also going to be testing this recipe for an updated Biscuits and Gravy recipe as well as other breakfast entrées, so stay tuned!

","Finely chop tempeh and add to a mixing bowl (or a food processor) along with remaining ingredients.Mix with clean hands (or pulse in the food processor) until very thoroughly combined. The texture should resemble sausage.Taste a small amount and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cayenne pepper or red pepper flake for heat, salt and pepper for overall flavor, brown sugar for sweetness, or paprika for smokiness.Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 24 hours, and up to 3 days to allow the flavors to develop.When ready to cook, line a 1/3 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap and fill with ""sausage."" Fold plastic wrap over the top and pack down. Then gently remove and set on a clean plate. Press down to form a 1/2-inch thick disc. Repeat until the mixture is used up - about 5 ""sausages"" (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp oil (or enough to coat the surface) and add only as many patties as will comfortably fit in the pan. Sprinkle with a bit more salt and pepper. (If trying to cut back on oil, see notes for baking instructions.)Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the underside is browned. Then gently flip (they can be fragile) and cook on the other side for 3-4 minutes more or until the underside is browned.Serve immediately. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. You can also make patties ahead of time (up to 1 month), freeze (uncooked), and then thaw before cooking."
250,Vegan BLT Sandwich with Eggplant Bacon | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan “BLT” Sandwich

As promised, my take on a vegan “BLT” sandwich! Trust me, it was worth the wait.

This sandwich is seriously easy once you have your Eggplant Bacon (or Coconut Bacon) and Vegan Mayo prepared.And it only requires 6 ingredients!
The base for this beauty is bread, such as my Easy Vegan Seeded Whole Grain Bread! Next comes a spread, eithervegan mayo or hummus! Then comes the “B” (bacon), “L” (lettuce), and “T” (tomato) and onion.

It’s as easy as that! I hope you all LOVE this vegan-ized BLT! It’s:
Crunchy
Fresh
Flavorful
Smoky
Saucy
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect lunch or easy weeknight meal. It is deliciouson its own, but it would also pair perfectly with my 5-Minute Detox Salad with No-Mix Dressing, Beet Chips, Vegan Potato Salad, Crispy Baked Garlic Fries, or Cajun Spiced Sweet Potato Fries!

","Toast bread (optional). In the meantime, heat skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add eggplant bacon (if using coconut bacon, no need to heat) and cook for 1-2 minutes. Then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side until warmed through. Remove from heat and set aside.To assemble sandwich, spread vegan mayo (or hummus) on the toasted bread slices. Then top one piece with Eggplant or Coconut Bacon, onion, tomato, and lettuce. Top with other piece of bread, slice (optional), and enjoy.Could be made ahead of time (up to a few hours), but best when fresh."
251,Easy Vegan Mayo with Aquafaba | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Aquafaba Mayo

It’s happening:Easy vegan mayo that’s perfectly creamy, thick, and tangy!You can do this.


This recipe requiresjust 5 minutes,6ingredients, and1-bowl to prepare.
The initial version of this recipe was made with a hand mixer, but I’ve since found that it doesn’t work for everyone, especially depending on the power of your mixer! So I’ve done more testing and now have a couple of ways this recipe works, including with both an immersion blender and a small upright blender (such as a Magic Bullet).


The base is aquafaba – the liquid/brine leftover in a can of chickpeas – which is blended with apple cider vinegar, brown rice syrup, mustard powder, and sea salt for flavor. Next comes a neutral oil for creaminess and body, which is streamed in while mixing. For oil, we found sunflower to work best, but avocado works too (just produces slightly less thick mayo).

I hope you all LOVE this mayo! It’s:
Creamy
Tangy
Rich
Easy to make
&amp; Delicious
This mayo is the beginning of so many wonderful things to come. It’s going to be perfect foraiolis,salad dressings, sandwiches, and more. It’s especially perfect on our Vegan BLT!

*6/22/18 Recipe updated for improved method and tips on how to get creamy, thick, tangy mayo every time.
","Add aquafaba to a tall glass jar (or, if using a Magic Bullet* or something similar, add to a small blender jar) along with ground mustard, sea salt, apple cider vinegar, and brown rice syrup. Blend on high with an immersion blender (or mix on your blender base) for 30 seconds until frothy.Measure the oil in a liquid measuring cup. Then, with the immersion blender on its highest speed, slowly stream the oil in over the course of 1-2 minutes. Doing so supports the immersion process. (If using a Magic Bullet or something similar, add all the oil at once and blend on high until a thick, creamy sauce is achieved - up to 4-5 minutes, scraping down sides / shaking as needed.)Move the immersion blender up and down to incorporate a little air toward the end. If it's looking too thin, add more oil. The more oil you add, the creamier, thicker, and denser the texture will become. You shouldn't need more than the recommended amount. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener of choice for sweetness (keeping in mind maple syrup will make it less thick + fluffy), vinegar for tanginess, salt for saltiness, or ground mustard for mustard flavor. I added a bit more of each. Use immediately or transfer to a sealed container in the refrigerator until cold - about 4 hours. It will thicken even more in the fridge! Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks (sometimes longer). You'll know it's gone bad when mold has formed. Not freezer friendly. Perfect for sandwiches, dressings, sauces, and more!"
252,Crispy Eggplant Bacon | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Eggplant “Bacon”

After trying my hand at coconut bacon and loving the flavor, I was lefthoping for a texture that was closer to the real thing.
Enter: Eggplant.
We’ve used eggplant to make delicious things like Baba Ganoush, Harissa Eggplant Dip, Eggplant Lasagna Roll-Ups, andCashew-Less Vegan Queso, but bacon may perhaps be its most brilliant use yet.
This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients(and it comes together in about 40 minutes).
Thin strips of eggplant are marinatedin a mixture of smoky spices, maple syrup, tamari, and vegan Worcestershire for the ultimate savory, sweet, spicy flavor.
The eggplant is then baked at a low temperature for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.


The result is crispy, smoky bacon-like strips that are 100% vegan and 100% delicious.
I hope you all love this eggplant “bacon.” It’s:
Smoky
Crispy
Salty
Slightly chewy
Easy to make
Insanely flavorful
&amp; SO delicious
How does one use eggplant “bacon,” you ask? Great question. I enjoyed mine directly from the pan (true story), but it would also be delicious mixed into (or served alongside) a tofu scramble, layered on a sandwich (more to come soon!), or atop salads, dips, and so much more.

","Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (107 C) - turn to “convection bake” if you have it to speed cooking time. Line 1 large or 2 small baking sheet(s) with parchment paper (amount/size as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Slice an eggplant in half lengthwise and set one half aside for other uses (such as Baba Ganoush, Vegan Queso, or 1-Pot Pasta). Then cut the remaining eggplant in half lengthwise once more so you have two long, skinny pieces.Use a sharp knife or mandolin to slice into very thin strips (resembling the size/shape of bacon). They should be thicker than paper thin - roughly 1/8th inch. Set aside.Make sauce by adding avocado oil, tamari, Worcestershire sauce, maple syrup, liquid smoke, paprika, sea salt, garlic powder, and black pepper to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine.Use a brush (or a spoon) to brush both sides of the eggplant slices with sauce. Arrange in a single layer on the parchment-lined baking sheet(s) and sprinkle with more black pepper.Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the eggplant is deep red in color, appears dry, and is slightly crispy. If needed, increase heat to 250 (121 C) at the end if not crisping up. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. It will crisp up the more it cools.Use immediately on things such as on sandwiches, in salads, or alongside or mixed into a tofu scramble.Once cooled, store in a sealed container in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. To reheat, heat a skillet over medium heat, add a little oil of choice, then heat bacon on both sides until warmed (be careful not to burn)."
253,Hemp Dark Chocolate Energy Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dark Chocolate Hemp Energy Bites

Fudgy, dark chocolate energy bites made with wholesome ingredients? Yes, please!
Ready your food processors, friends. Let’s make the tastiest snack on the block!

These energy bites are made with 6 simple ingredients in less than 30 minutes!
The base is my favorite natural sweetener: dates!

I love dates because they’re nature’s caramel and boast minerals like zinc, potassium, magnesium, and iron!
Walnuts come next, which add protein and are high in omega 3 fatty acids.
Cacao powder adds rich chocolate flavor as well as phytonutrients, magnesium, and iron.
Almond butter provides even more protein as well as vitamin E, manganese, and biotin.
Andhemp seeds add omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, iron, magnesium, and zinc. Plus, they’re a perfect protein, boasting 20amino acids, including the 9 essential amino acids.

I think we can all agree that this is one healthy snack.

The texture of these bitesis close to a truffle!
They’re so chocolatyand rich and moist. And when you roll them in cacao powder, they even get a little fudgy and sticky. I mean, this is a dreamy scenario.


I hope you all LOVE these energy bites! They’re:
Fudgy
Chocolaty
Rich
Perfectlysweet
Super healthy
Easy to make
&amp; Kind of amazing
These bites would make the perfect snack or a healthier dessert. I love having two (or three) in the afternoon for a little energy boost alongsidea cup of tea. They would also make a great topper forOvernight Oats, 5-Minute Smoothie Bowls, orDark Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowls!

","Add dates to a food processor and pulse/mix until small bites remain or a ball forms. Scoop out and set aside.Add walnuts to the food processor and pulse into a fine meal. Then add cacao powder, hemp seeds and sea salt. Pulse a few more times to combine. (Don't overmix or the walnuts will turn into butter.)Add the dates back in along with the almond butter and melted coconut oil (optional). Mix/pulse to combine. The result should be a moist dough-like mixture. If too wet, add a bit more cacao powder or hemp seeds.Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Then scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (I like this scoop) and carefully form into balls. The dough will be somewhat fragile, so use the warmth of your hands to gently form/roll them into balls. There should be about 20 energy bites total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Roll in extra hemp seeds or cacao powder (optional). Note: The bites get a fudgy, sticky outer texture when rolled in cacao powder - which I liked. But for less sticky energy bites, stick with hemp seeds!Store leftovers in a well-sealed container in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month."

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and arrange oats and almonds on a bare baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until slightly toasted. They shouldn't be browned, just slightly toasted for more flavor. Reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (162 C).In the meantime, add flaxseed meal, desiccated coconut, and sea salt to a large mixing bowl and stir. Set aside.Once oats and almonds are toasted, add to the mixing bowl along with chopped dates. Loosely stir to combine and set aside.Add almond butter, coconut oil, and maple syrup to a small saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Then remove from heat and immediately add to the oats (see photo).Use a mixing spoon (or your hands) to mix thoroughly, ensuring that the dates and the almond butter mixture are evenly dispersed and coating all of the dry ingredients.Add the mixture to a parchment-lined 8x8-inch baking pan (size/number as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and spread into an even layer. Then top with another layer of parchment paper and press down with something flat - such as a measuring cup - to press into an even, uniform layer.Bake at 325 degrees F (162 C) for 20-25 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan. Transfer to the freezer to speed cooling time.Once cooled, lift out of the pan and slice into desired number of bars. I went with 6 bars, but you could easily do 8 bars or 12 squares (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Optional: Melt dark chocolate and coconut oil in a small mixing bowl in the microwave or over a double boiler on the stovetop. Spoon a small amount over the bars in a drizzle pattern or cover half of the bar with chocolate.

255,Gluten-Free Vegan Kale Nachos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Kale Chip Nachos (30 Minutes!)

I used to make these nachosall the time as a “single lady dinner” on nights spent bymyselfor with girlfriends who were also into “hippie dippy” meals. Where my fellow hippies at? (Raise your hands!)
I love this mealbecause it’s healthy, satisfying, and comes together so quickly! Plus, Mexican food for the win. Let’s make nachos, shall we?

These nachos are simple, requiring just 7ingredients and 30 minutes to prepare!
The base is kale chips (!!), lightly seasoned with smoky spices and nutritional yeast. Check out my basic recipe for these, which can modified to include any number of flavors or seasoning, like these 30-Minute Cheesy Kale Chips.
Next comes pan-fried sweet potatoes – my new favorite way to make sweet potatoes super fast without requiringanother pan in the oven (so the kale chips can do their thang). This method allows the potatoesto get crispy on the outside while the inside remainstender, and the whole process takes just 7-8 minutes!
Last but not least, simply heat up some cooked black beans and season with cumin and chili powder. I told you we could do this. Healthy nachos for the win.

All that’s left is assembly!
The beauty of this recipe is that it’s super versatile and can betopped with anything you like. I personally love a little salsa, avocado, and red onion. But you could also make guacamole, throw on some hot sauce, or even add some Saucy Chipotle Tofu, which you can find in our Everyday Cooking Cookbook(under BraisedTofu Tostadas).

I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Crispy
Flavorful
Filling
Healthy
Versatile
Quick + Easy
&amp; Super delicious
This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving something satisfying and healthybut still quick and easy to make.
It’s a great entrée, but can also be an appetizer or side on Mexican night.

You may need to bake them in 2 batches (or more if increasing batch size) depending on size of baking sheets.Bake for 15 minutes. Then remove from oven and toss/stir to ensure even baking. Bake for 5-10 minutes more or until chips are crispy and slightly golden brown.

Then add sliced sweet potatoes in a single layer. Cover to steam.Cook for 3-5 minutes, checking every couple of minutes to see if the undersides are brown. Once brown, flip to the other side, cover, and continue cooking until both sides are brown and potatoes are tender (about 7-8 minutes total). Set aside.To serve, arrange kale chips on a serving platter and top with sweet potatoes, black beans, and any other desired toppings, such as avocado, salsa, cilantro, or red onion. Serves 2 as an entrée or 4 as a side (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Store leftover sweet potatoes and black beans separately in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Store leftover kale chips in a well-sealed container at room temperature up to 3 days (though best when fresh).Serve these as is or with my Chipotle Black Bean Tortilla Soup or 5-Ingredient Ginger Beer Margaritas!"
256,Vegan Chocolate Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffins (GF)

Remember those Vegan Banana Nut Muffins I made recently? If not, you should make them. Like, STAT.
Well, as I was writing the post, I realized I had yet to make my second favorite flavor of muffin in gluten-free form. That had to change, obviously.
Spoiler alert: It totally worked and they’re totally delicious.

This is another 1-bowl recipe! It also requires simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
The base of the batter is flax eggs, applesauce, coconut oil, and almond milk. Good news! These muffins are naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar.
To keep them gluten-free, I useda mixture of gluten-free oat flour, almond flour, and my DIY Gluten-Free Flour Blend. This is my go-to blend in most baked goods for keeping them light, airy, and tender.
The chocolate flavor comes from cocoa powder and vegan dark chocolate chips (my favorites being Enjoy Life or Trader Joe’s). I suggest a modest amount of chocolate chips in the recipe, but then I went ahead and topped them with another hefty handful before baking. Because chocolate is life.

These muffins rise beautifullyand then fall a bit when they’re cooling. But not to worry! That doesn’t mean they’re not perfectly fluffy, tender, and crumbly on the inside.
And I love how the top forms a bit of a crust while the inside remains super moist and chocolaty. Total swoon-fest. You’re gonna want, like, three of these with a glass of almond milk immediately. Trust me.

I hope you all LOVE these muffins! They’re:
Chocolaty
Tender
Moist on the inside
Crumblyon the outside
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
Naturally sweetened (!!)
&amp; So delicious
These would make the perfect healthier treat to accompany a breakfast such as a scramble or asmoothie. They would also make a lovely afternoon snack or dessert.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line 9-10 muffins (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) with paper liners (I prefer these, as they don’t stick to the muffins).Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add applesauce, maple syrup, coconut sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt and whisk again. Then stir in the melted coconut oil and almond milk and whisk to combine.Add cocoa powder, gluten-free flour, oat flour, and almond flour and whisk until just combined. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk. But it should be quite thick and NOT pourable – rather scoopable.Lastly, stir in chocolate chips. Then divide batter evenly between muffin tins, filling all the way full (should be enough for 9-10 // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and top with a few more chocolate chips (optional).Bake for 22-28 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the edges appear dry. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan. Then remove from tins and let cool on a cooling rack. Texture is best when cooled completely.Will keep covered at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month."
257,Brussels Sprout Slaw with Coconut Bacon | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Brussels Sprout Slaw with Coconut Bacon

What’s that? We need yetanother reasonto love Brussels sprouts more than we already do? (Yes, we totally do).
Presenting a warm and savory Brussels sprout slaw that screams winter, is über comforting, and is quick and easy to make.

This recipe requires just 30 minutes and less than 10 ingredients to prepare.
The base is shredded Brussels sprouts, which are tossed in a tangy, slightly sweet mustard sauce. Hubba.

Pecans add nuttiness and a little protein, while coconut bacon (!!) adds a lovely crunch and saltiness to thedish.
This was admittedly my first time trying coconut bacon, and I was super impressed! I played around with a couple of recipes and developed my own version. Find it here!
Coconut bacon doesn’t quite have the texture of bacon (unless you like yours super crispy), but it does mimic the flavors quite well! It’s perfect for adding to salads, sandwiches, and warm slaws like this one.

I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Savory
Crunchy
Vegetable-packed
Comforting
Healthy
&amp; Incredibly flavorful
This would make the perfect side dish to bring along to parties, or it would pair well with mainslike my Portobello Steaks with Avocado Chimichurri, Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls, or Best Vegan Pulled Pork Sandwich.

","If you haven't toasted your pecans or made your coconut bacon yet (optional), do so first. Toast pecans by roasting in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.In the meantime, trim Brussels sprouts and very thinly slice with a knife or use the sliding disc on your food processor to thinly shred.Add sauce ingredients to a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.Heat a large, rimmed metal or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and shallot and sauté for 3-4 minutes or until soft and slightly caramelized.Add Brussels sprouts, stir, and cover. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.Remove lid and add sauce, pecans, and coconut bacon (optional). Continue cooking for 3-4 minutes more, stirring occasionally, or until Brussels sprouts are tender and slightly caramelized.Serve warm as is or garnish with freshly chopped parsley (optional). Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave until hot."
258,Blueberry Almond Butter Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Blueberry Almond Butter Smoothie

This was supposed to be a green smoothie, but when it came time to make it, I was craving blueberries instead.
Fruit and almond butter over greens. Go figure.
But that’s OK! I’m getting better at listeningto my body’s cues. And, when it asks for blueberries, I give it blueberries.

This smoothie requires 6 simple ingredients, a blender, and 5 minutes to make.
The base is frozen ripe banana and wild, organic, frozen blueberries (a wintertime favorite of mine). Next comes almond butter for some plant-based protein and creaminess, and almond milk blends everything together. I also added flax and chia seed for plant-based fiber and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
Not only is this smoothie healthy, it’s insanely delicious. It’s somewhere between a blueberry milkshake and abanana smoothie – my favorite. Trust me, you’re gonna want this smoothie.

I hope you all love this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Bright blue
Blueberry-infused
Perfectly sweet
Super nutritious
&amp; So tasty
This would make the perfect, quick weekday breakfast or afternoon snack. It’s even a suitable dessert!I love adding a little coconut milk to my serving glass before pouring on the smoothie for a “swirl” effect. Makes mealtime more fun (and beautiful).

","Add frozen banana, blueberries, almond butter, flaxseed meal, chia seeds, and almond milk to a high-speed blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth. Protein powder is optional and I skipped it, but it would make a great addition for more staying powder (just know it will affect the flavor/sweetness). See my full Vegan Vanilla Protein Powder Review for recommendations.If it has trouble blending, add a bit more almond milk. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana (or a bit of stevia) for sweetness, blueberries for fruitiness, almond butter for nuttiness/creaminess, or almond milk to thin.To serve: An optional step is to pour a bit of light coconut milk or almond milk into your serving glass(es) first and then top with the smoothie for a swirl effect! Coconut milk is thicker and makes a better swirl, but both work.Garnish with additional chia seeds and/or almond butter (optional) and enjoy! Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2 days, though best when fresh."
259,Vegan White Chocolate Truffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient White Chocolate Truffles

This recipe has been a long time coming because white chocolate can be quite difficult to make vegan.
But, with a little inventiveness and lots of testing, I cracked the code!
Friends, allow me to introduce your new BFF: Vegan White Chocolate Truffles!

Originally, I was testing this recipe with a base of cocoa butter, coconut cream, and cornstarch, but it turned out either like pudding or rock hard and crumbly. Back to the drawing board.
In the midst of all of this, I was snacking on macadamia nuts – serendipitous, eh? – and gotthe idea to use them as a base with cocoa butter! Now, we’re making progress.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients to make!
The method is easy, too: Blend macadamia nuts and coconut into abutter, add remaining ingredients, and mix. Then refrigerate and roll into truffles!
The mixture of the nuts with the coconut creates the perfect creamy base, while cocoa butter adds that rich chocolate flavor and hardens them up so they form truffles! Swoon!


I hope you all LOVE these truffles!
They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Perfectly sweet
White chocolate-infused
Coconutty
Easy to make
&amp; Super dreamy
These would make the perfect vegan-friendly treats for special occasions like Valentine’s Day and beyond! They would also make a lovely gift and are the perfect dessert to make, pop in the fridge or freezer, and enjoy throughout the week!

","Add macadamia nuts and desiccated coconut (1 1/2 cups as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a food processor and mix until a creamy paste is formed, scraping down sides as needed.Add melted cocoa butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and sea salt (optional) and mix once more to combine (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, vanilla for vanilla flavor, or powdered sugar for sweetness.Transfer the mixture to a shallow plate or a bowl and place in the refrigerator to chill for about 1 hour or until firm to the touch (especially in the center). In the meantime, add 3/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) desiccated coconut to a small dish (for rolling). Set aside.Remove mixture from refrigerator and use a Tablespoon or small cookie scoop (I like this one) to scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts. Either leave as a ""disc"" shape or gently roll into balls. If you roll for too long, they can start to melt, so don't fuss too much with the shape.Once formed, add to the desiccated coconut dish and roll to coat. Set on a serving plate. Repeat until all truffles are rolled - about 10.Set back in refrigerator for 5-10 minutes until mostly firm/set. Store leftovers at room temperature up to 3-4 days, in the refrigerator for 1 week, or in the freezer for 1 month. Best enjoyed at room temperature."
260,Smashed Potatoes with Pesto | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Smashed Potatoes with Garlic Pesto

I have a serious thing for potatoes (because carbs), but this recipe elevates it to an obsession.
We’ve all had breakfast potatoes and mashed potatoesand french fries, but what about smashed potatoes? Yeah, get ready for crispy, tender potatoes with a flavor explosion.
Carbs + sauce for the win.

These potatoes are easy to make, requiring just 9 ingredients and about 1 hour to make!
The concept is simple. Boil baby potatoes until tender. Then smash until almost flat and roastuntil crispy and golden brown. The result is a perfectly tender, buttery potato with golden-brown, crispy edges.
While that’s happening, make your creamy, garlic-herb vegan pesto! Just 5 minutes to make, insanely vibrant and flavorful, and such a gorgeous green hue. Now, we’re ready for assembly!

","Add rinsed potatoes to a large pot and cover with water until just submerged. Bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce to medium-high heat to achieve a low boil. Cook uncovered for 15-20 minutes or until tender and a knife easily slides in and out.In the meantime, prepare pesto by adding basil, garlic, nuts, lemon juice, and nutritional yeast to a food processor and blending to combine. Stream in 2-3 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) a little at at time until a thick paste is formed. If trying to reduce fat, thin the sauce with water instead of additional oil. I like adding a little water to mine to make it more of a pourable sauce, but this is optional.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt and pepper for overall flavor, or garlic for zing/bite. Transfer to a small serving dish and set aside.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. When the potatoes are soft and tender, place on the baking sheet and smash down with the bottom of a saucepan. For any larger potatoes, cut in half and then smash so they are still ""bite size.""Drizzle the potatoes with 1 1/2 Tbsp oil and season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) . Roast for 20-25 minutes or until crispy and golden brown.To serve, spoon the pesto over the potatoes (you will have leftovers). Garnish with chopped basil or parsley and additional pine nuts (optional).Best when fresh. Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator. Potatoes will keep for 3-4 days. Pesto will keep for about 1 week (see notes for uses for leftovers). Reheat in a 350-degree oven until hot, then top with any leftover pesto."
261,1-Bowl Vegan Banana Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Banana Nut Muffins (GF)

My very favorite kind of muffin on the planet isbanana walnut. Always has been, (likely) always will be. The only flavor that comes close is Double Chocolate Chip (which I’m officially adding to my gluten-free experimentation list!)
I’ve madeGluten-Free Banana Bread for the blog but have yet todeliver on a solid muffin recipe. That had to change.

This recipe is simple, requiring basic ingredients and just 1 bowl to prepare!
It’s adapted from my 1-Bowl Vegan GF Nutella Banana Bread, which is a total winner if you haven’t tried it yet! Anything with (Vegan) Nutella in it has my heart.
I tested this recipe with aquafaba (chickpea brine), which yielded a super moist muffin. But it was almost too moist. So I went back to my old, trusty flax eggand had much better results.

I hope you all LOVE these muffins! They’re:
Tender
Crumbly
Flavorful
Banana-infused
Nutty
Perfectly sweet
Easyto make
&amp; Kind of perfect
These are officially my favorite banana muffin! The inside is moist and tenderwhile the outside isperfectly crumbly and studded with roasted walnuts. Swoon!
They’redelicious as is or slathered in vegan butter, but they would be even better served alongside a Ginger Latte, Hot Cocoa, or even a Green Smoothie Bowlfor a hearty breakfast.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a standard muffin tin with paper baking cups.

Wait 5 minutes. Then add banana, baking powder, and baking soda and mash until only small chunks remain.Add vanilla, oil, coconut sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, sea salt, and cinnamon (optional) and whisk vigorously to combine.

Remove from oven and let cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then remove from tin and let cool completely on a cooling rack.

262,Chocolate Chip Almond Meal Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies (Vegan + GF)

Say hello to the only cookie you’ll ever need.
No, but seriously.

These really are my new favorite cookie. And, by new, I mean an old favorite (that’s beenveganized)!
If you’ve tried these Almond Meal Cookies with Coconut and Chocolate Chips, you already know how amazing theyare. However, the recipe does require an egg, and a reader recently suggested/asked if I had tried veganizing them. Brilliant idea, reader. Thank you!
Because I’m always testing new recipes, I rarely reach back and remake old ones. But this called fora special retest! Onto the show.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and roughly 1 hour (including chilling)!
The base is shredded coconut and almond meal (I mixed in a little almond flour for added fluffiness). For sweetness, I stuck with organic brown sugar, but I also think coconut sugar would work if you’re trying to go au naturel. And coconut oil and vanilla are the only liquid ingredients, besides…
Aquafaba! In place of the egg is aquafaba.Are you even surprised at this point? Aquafaba never lets me down. (See Peanut Butter Cup Cookies, Fluffy Sugar Cookies, Best-Ever Cornbread, Pumpkin Cake…The list goes on.)
After the dough has been mixed and chilled for 30 minutes, scoop,bake for 12-15 minutes, and BAM. You have chocolate chip cookie perfection.

These cookies are AMAZING. They’re:
Crispy on the outside
Tender + chewy on the inside
Perfectly sweet
Chocolaty
Coconutty
Easy to make
&amp; INSANELY delicious

","In a large mixing bowl, stir together almond meal, dark chocolate chips, coconut, baking powder, salt, and sugar.In a separate bowl, beat aquafaba (using a handheld mixer or whisking vigorously) until light and fluffy and loose peaks have formed. (Add a little cream of tartar to help them along if not whipping.)To the aquafaba, add the melted coconut oil and vanilla and beat or whisk to combine. Then add to dry ingredients and mix until just combined. You should have a firm, semi-tacky dough (see photo).Loosely cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or overnight.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Scoop out 1 /1/2-Tablespoon amounts of dough (I like this scoop) and form into small discs (see photo). Place on a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap in between each cookie to allow for spreading. There should be about 12 cookies (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Be careful not to burn (especially on the bottoms).Remove from oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes. Then carefully loosen with a spatula - they can stick a little to the bare pan.Enjoy immediately or let cool. Store leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature up to 4 days or 1 month in the freezer. These are insanely delicious when warm and dipped in almond milk or hot cocoa!"
263,Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowl (30 Minutes!)

We’ve nearly made it through January (!), and I don’t know about you, but my body is still craving vegetable-rich, healthy entrées.
One of my easy, go-to meals is gado-gado – a traditional Indonesian dish we discovered when we went to Bali way back in 2013. The concept is simple: rice topped with raw or lightly steamed veggies and a spicy peanut sauce.
That’s my kind of meal (and you better believe I ate plenty during our trip). Shall we?

This 30-minute recipe is adapted from my Sweet Potato Gado-Gado Bowl in our 31 Meals eCookbook– a month of healthy dinner recipes, plus a meal plan + grocery lists!
In place of rice, I subbed quinoa for even more plant-based protein. For the vegetables, I kept things light and fresh (even omitting the classic steamed potatoes) for green beans, mung bean sprouts, red pepper, carrots, and cabbage.
I didn’t hold out on the sauce though. When in doubt, add more peanut sauce. (That should totally be my life motto.)

Traditionally gado-gado peanut sauce is on the spicier side, so I add plenty of chili garlic sauce. But, if heat isn’t your thing, hold off and keep it on the sweet and tangy side. No judgments here.
I hope you guys love this bowl! It’s:
Healthy
Hearty
Colorful
Nutritious
Satisfying
Quick + Easy
Customizable
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect plant-based meal when you’re craving tons of veggies but also plenty of staying powder. Each serving boasts more than 20 grams of protein! And it’s so easy to customize. If you’re needing more carbs, add quartered, steamed baby potatoes. If you’re needing more protein, add my 25-Minute Crispy Tofu! Peanut-sensitive? Sub with another nut or seed butter (options listed below). The possibilitiesare endless.
Plus, leftovers store and pack beautifully, making it ideal for lunches throughoutthe week. Total win. And, if you’re looking for even MORE healthy recipes, check out our 12-Recipe Detox Guide(!) – free when you sign up for our email list.

","Heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add rinsed, drained quinoa. ""Toast"" for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, to remove excess liquid and add a nutty flavor to the quinoa. Then add water, stir, and bring to a low boil. Then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 18-20 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Fluff with a fork, remove lid, and set off heat.While quinoa is cooking, steam green beans until just tender. You can do this either in the microwave (covered, in 1-minute increments) or by placing green beans in a steamer basket inside a large saucepan filled with 1 inch of water. Bring the water to a simmer on medium-high heat, cover, and cook until just tender - about 4 minutes.Once steamed, add green beans to a bowl of ice water to ""shock"" them (stop them from cooking).

Then add water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a semi-thick but pourable sauce is formed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tamari for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce/Thai chili/red pepper flake for heat! You want this to be a balance of tangy, sweet, salty, and spicy, so don't be shy with the seasonings!To serve, divide quinoa between 2 serving bowls (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with green beans, red bell pepper, mung bean sprouts, and carrots. Serve with peanut sauce and any additional toppings (optional), such as cilantro, lime wedges, and red pepper flake.Store leftovers separately in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days (peanut sauce keeps for 1+ week).

Sometimes, you just need a classic. Today is one of those days.
Say hello to my vegan-ized version of potato salad. Creamy, savory, and hearty, it requires just 10 ingredients. What’s not to love?

This potato salad is made with red potatoes – my favorite – for the ultimate potato salad texture. (Yellow potatoes tend to get too soft + I love the red skin for a pop of color.)
Fresh, chopped vegetables – I went with bell pepper, celery, and onion – add plenty of crunch and plant-based fiber. And last but not least, my cashew garlic-herb dressing marries everything together.
I hope you all LOVE this potato salad! It’s:

265,Vegan Baked Chocolate Donuts (GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Chocolate Donuts (Vegan + GF)

Did you know there’s been a donut pan saga in our home?
I’ve been contemplating making baked donuts for the blog since the very beginning, but I always had a hard time justifying a donut pan when my recipes require just standard, minimal equipment. I don’t even own a stand mixer! Yes, I take this minimalist stuff seriously.
Fast forward nearly 5 years and practically everyone has a donut pan – except me. I’ve watched as other bloggers put out the most fabulous-looking baked donut recipes, and all the while, I – a longtime donut lover – have sat idly by, thinking they weren’t for me.
Enough!I recently realized that it would be worth it if I put it to good use. Besides,what if I createda donut that was not onlysimple to make, but also undetectably vegan and gluten-free? Clearly, I bought thedonut panand haven’t looked back since. Friends, let’s make DONUTS (finally)!

This recipe is simple, requiring basic ingredients and 30 minutes to prepare! And they’re naturally sweetened and (vegan) butter-free!
The base is adapted from my 1- Bowl VeganGF Chocolate Hazelnut Cake (hubba), only in place of the flax egg, I tested out aquafaba! No surprise – it totally worked. However, I also included some workarounds in the notes if you don’t have (or are afraid of) aquafaba.
While your donuts bake, why not make an optional (but highly recommended) naturally-sweetened coconut oil glaze? That’s what I said! Doooo it! Doooo it!

I hope you all LOVE these donuts! They’re:
Fluffy
Chocolaty
Perfectlysweet
Quickto make
&amp; Undetectably Vegan + GF
These donuts would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast treat or healthier dessert! The optional glaze kind of seals the deal, in my opinion. Plus, it allows for fun toppings like cacao nibs, coconut flakes, and sprinkles!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and lightly grease two donut pans*.To a small mixing bowl, add aquafaba and use a mixer (or whisk) to vigorously blend until soft peaks form - about 1-2 minutes. Set aside. (If yours doesn’t quite whip up into soft peaks, it’s OK. Just get them as fluffy as possible! A sprinkle of cream of tartar helps them firm up.)Warm almond milk in the microwave. This way, it doesn’t harden the coconut oil. Set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add the melted coconut oil. Then add the coconut sugar, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and sea salt and whisk vigorously to combine - about 45 seconds. Then add applesauce and warmed almond milk and whisk once more to combine.Add baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder (sifted if clumpy), almond flour, and gluten-free flour and whisk to combine.Lastly, add the whipped aquafaba and gently stir/whisk in, trying to be as gentle as possible. If the batter appears too thin at this point, add 1 Tbsp each almond flour or gluten-free flour at a time until it thickens up. It should be semi-thick and more scoopable than pourable.Divide batter evenly between donut tins, filling all the way full. There should be 11-12 donuts (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top appears dry and fluffy. Time will vary if you sub ingredients.In the meantime, make glaze (optional). To a small mixing bowl, add melted coconut oil, maple syrup, sifted cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine. You should have a slightly thick glaze. If too thick, thin with a little maple syrup or more coconut oil. If too thin, add cocoa powder.Taste and adjust sweetness if needed by adding more maple syrup. Set aside. Prepare any other toppings, such as coconut flakes, cacao nibs, or sprinkles, at this time.Remove donuts from oven and let cool for 1-2 minutes. Then grab the tins with a towel and tap on the counter 2 times to loosen. Then gently invert onto a cooling rack. Let cool for 5 minutes (the longer they cool, the more they'll firm up).Dip in glaze. Then top with desired toppings, such as sprinkles, coconut flakes, or cacao nibs!Best when fresh. Store cooled leftovers covered at room temperature up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month (best if stored unglazed)."
266,The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles

I have made vegan, gluten-free waffles before, but none compare to these.
These perfectwaffles are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, perfectly sweet, and undetectably vegan and gluten-free. Shall we?

This recipe was a reader request. Someone asked if I’d tested whipped aquafaba (the brine/liquid in a can of chickpeas) in classic waffles, which I hadn’t! So I got to work testing.Obviously, things worked in my favor.
This recipe requires just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make.
And, while pretty much any waffle iron will do, I have to say I recently retired my old waffle iron and replaced it with aBelgian-style waffle maker. Friends. I’m in love. It creates perfect, fluffy, massivewaffles with little effort and zero non-stick spray or greasing.There’s no turning back now. I’m henceforth a Belgian waffle girl.

The batter mixes up pretty much like any traditional waffle, except in place of whipped egg whites, I used whipped aquafaba, which I’ve used in my Fluffy Vegan Sugar Cookies, Peanut Butter Cup Cookies, Best Vegan Gluten Free Cornbread, Vegan Pumpkin Cake, and more!
I think it’s safe to say aquafaba is the coolest egg substitute on the block and super versatile. It can be used straight from the can or whipped, and it mocks an egg beautifully in baked goods. Expect more recipes with it in the future!

I hope you LOVE these waffles! They’re:
Crispy on the outside
Fluffy on the inside
Perfectly sweet
Undetectably vegan + gluten-free
Easy to make
&amp; SOdelicious
These are officially my new go-to waffle. They’ve received rave reviews in my circle of friends (for good reason). Expectflavor variations in the future – because carbs for breakfast for the win.
These waffles are delicious plain, but they’re irresistible with peanut butter, banana, and maple syrup. So good!

","To a large mixing bowl, add gluten-free flour, oat flour, almond flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and organic cane sugar. Whisk to combine. Set aside.To a medium mixing bowl, add coconut milk, vanilla (optional), and melted vegan butter and whisk thoroughly to combine. Set aside.To a small mixing bowl, add aquafaba and whisk vigorously or beat on high until soft peaks form. (It's OK if they don't quite form peaks - just get it as light and foamy as possible.)Add wet ingredients (excluding aquafaba) to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Then add whipped aquafaba and fold into the batter with a mixing spoon until just combined (see photos for guidance).Let the batter rest while your iron preheats - about 5 minutes.Once preheated, add roughly 1 cup batter (or until the surface is almost completely covered) to the waffle iron and close. My new waffle iron (which I love so far) makes Belgium-style waffles, so it flips the waffle over to spread the batter evenly, which helped these puff up and crisp up really well. Depending on your model, cook for 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.Remove cooked waffle from the iron, place on a baking sheet, and keep warm in a 200 degree F (93 C) oven while continuing to cook waffles until batter is used up. The recipes yields about 3 large or 5 small waffles depending on the size of your waffle iron (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve immediately with desired toppings. These are delicious plain or with a little vegan butter and maple syrup. However, my favorite combination is peanut butter and banana plus maple syrup.Store leftovers in the refrigerator for 3 days or the freezer for 1 month. Reheats extremely well in oven on low-medium broil or toaster until hot and crispy."

The base of this salad is a tonof vegetables, including red pepper, cabbage, onions, and carrot “noodles.” Next comes some brown rice vermicelli noodles – because carbs. I also threw in some cilantro and mint for added flavor and green power.
The star of the show is my Marinated Peanut Tempeh, which I am OBSESSED with. I can’t stop making it. If you’re a tempeh hater, this will convert you – guaranteed.
And last but not least, the 6-ingredient peanut sauce, which marries everything together perfectly. If nut-free, sub sunflower butter – it’s so dreamy!

This recipe requires just 7 ingredients to make and involves the easiest preparation ever: Steam tempeh, make marinade, let marinate, BAKE. That’s it!
The only part that takes a little planning is the marinating. I suggest a 2-24-hour window. The longer the better and the more saucy and flavorful your tempeh will be. So go on. Give it a day. Go out and see something, kid. Go explore the city. Go see nature. Let your tempeh do its thang.

","To remove bitterness from the tempeh, add to rimmed skillet or saucepan filled with 1 inch of water and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Steam tempeh for a total of 10-12 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point. Then rinse, pat dry, and cut into thin, bite-size pieces. I prefer slicing the tempeh in half lengthwise then cutting into small triangles. (The smaller the pieces, the better they can soak up the marinade.) Set aside.Mix marinade by adding chili, sesame oil, peanut butter, tamari, lime juice, and maple syrup. Whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more crushed chili for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or tamari for saltiness. Don't be shy - you want this extremely flavorful!Add the sliced tempeh to the marinade and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 24 hours. I found that 24 hours infused the most flavor! While marinating, toss/stir occasionally to ensure even coating. (Pro tip: Just before baking, drizzle with a bit more maple syrup and tamari for extra flavor. Optional but recommended!)Once marinated, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add tempeh and reserve any leftover marinade to brush/coat the tempeh once baked.Bake for 22-30 minutes or until caramelized and deep golden brown. Remove from oven and brush/coat with any remaining marinade.This tempeh is delicious for adding to Asian-inspired dishes like spring rolls, salads, and noodle dishes! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Best when fresh."

We could all use a little diet reframing this time of year, myself included.
December invites moreindulgence than usual, and my body is all, “Hey, lady. Can a sister get some greens or what?”
My body is sassy. I can’t blame her. I’m a lot to deal with.


These are perhaps the prettiest 30-minute spring rolls on the block because the exterior isn’t traditional rice paper – it’s collard greens! I know. So cool.
Before you get intimidated and run the other direction, screaming, “What’s a collard green and what do I do with it?” – don’t. Collard greens make such a nice swap for traditional rice paper because they’re sturdy, bendable, and insanely healthy (plenty of vitamins A, K, + C).

Next comes an array ofsuper fresh, filling ingredients like firm tofu, basil, red pepper, cabbage, carrot, and bean sprout. Roll it up into a spring roll shape – you got this – and then it’s onto the sauce.
The dipping sauce is nut-free (!) because it’s based with sunflower seed butter. If you’d rather, peanut, almond, and cashew butter work well here, too. Look at that saucy goodness.


I hope you all LOVE these rolls. They’re:
Fresh
Filling
Colorful
Vibrant
Insanely healthy
Easy to make (30 minutes!)

","Start by wrapping your tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and setting something heavy on top (such as a cast-iron skillet) to drain the excess liquid.In the meantime, prep the collard greens by chopping the stems off and using a small, sharp knife to slightly shave/trim down the thickness of the stems at the base of the leaf. This isn't a necessary step, but it will allow it to fold/roll more easily.Next, prep vegetables and slice the tofu in long, rectangular cubes. Arrange on a tray or cutting board (see photo).Prepare dipping sauce by adding sunflower seed butter, tamari, maple syrup, lime juice, and chili garlic sauce to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add enough warm water to thin into a thick but pourable sauce. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime juice for acidity, chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or tamari for saltiness.Next, lay a collard green down on a flat surface, and near the stem, layer on basil, tofu, red pepper, cabbage, bean sprout, and carrot (see photo). Use your hands to fold the collard green over once so the fillings are secured inside, and then tuck in the sides of the collard green and continue rolling until you have a loose spring roll. Lay seam-side down on a serving platter and continue until all fillings are used - about 11-12 rolls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).To serve, I sliced my rolls in half and arranged them in a serving bowl with the dipping sauce (see photo). But you can also just leave them whole!These keep extremely well in the refrigerator up to 3 days, and the sauce will keep for up to 5-7 days (stored covered, separately in the fridge)."

This cocktail is inspired by a mimosa served at one of our favorite brunch spots in Portland – Besaw’s.

Toss to combine.Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the fruit is bubbly and most of the cranberries have burst. Transfer mixture to a food processor or small blender and blend/mix on high until a compote consistency is reached. If needed, add more water to thin (see photo).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more orange zest for citrusy flavor or maple syrup for sweetness (I added a little more of both).To remove any residual pulp and give the puree a smoother texture, work through a fine mesh strainer/sieve and into a serving container/jar. This is an optional step that makes the cocktail easier to mix.Transfer the compote to the refrigerator to chill - about 30 minutes to 1 hour or until cool to the touch.To serve, add about 2 Tbsp of the compote into each serving glass (champagne flutes are ideal). Top with a bit of champagne. Then use a spoon or stirrer to blend the two together. This will help the fruit mix with the champagne more seamlessly.Top with more champagne until the flutes or glasses are 3/4 full. Enjoy immediately! You will likely have leftover compote, which will keep for 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator."

Whew. I don’t know about you, but we ate like kings this weekend, and now I’m in need of a healthy reset.
Solution? This salad.


This may appear to be just another salad, but don’t be fooled.
It requires just5 minutes and 1 bowl to make, and the dressing doesn’t require mixing! Oh yeah.
It’s literally a lazy cook’s dream: Dump a bunch of ingredients in a bowl and call it a meal. And it’s healthy! Does it get any better than that?

I created this salad after a spree of testing dessert recipes for the holidays. And after one too many cookies, I was in need of a little detoxing. This did the trick.
A bed of greens is topped withveggies, sunflower seeds, ripe avocado for healthy fats, and dried cranberries for a little sweetness. Then drizzle on tahini, lemon, and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. It makes the salad taste so delicious + the no mixing means one less dish to clean up.
To add more protein to this salad, serve with cooked (and cooled) quinoa, baked chickpeas, or additionalsunflower seeds.

That’s right.No bowl required. Just dumpwalnuts and pecans onto a baking sheet, season, roast for 12-15 minutes, and BAM. You have roasty, toasty, delectable gifts or snacks. Wasn’t that simple?

These nuts truly are so easythey’vebecomemy go-to last-minute snack, salad– and oatmeal-topper, and gift (of course).
They’re:
Insanely crunchy
Perfectly sweet
Subtly spiced
Surprisingly healthy
&amp; Insanely delicious.
Keep them all for yourself or double the recipe and portion out into jars wrapped with twine and a little gift tag. Awe, isn’t that cute? And festive? Yeah, it totally is.
We hope you give this recipe a try. If you do, let us know by leaving a comment, rating it, and tagging a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Add pecans and walnuts to a bare (or parchment-lined) baking sheet (or more baking sheets if increasing batch size) and top with oil, coconut sugar, cinnamon, cayenne, nutmeg, salt, and half of the maple syrup (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Toss to coat.Bake for a total of 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant, tossing/stirring once at the halfway point to ensure even cooking. Then remove from oven and immediately drizzle with remaining maple syrup (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). I also like to sprinkle on a little more salt, cinnamon, and coconut sugar to coat, but this is optional.Stir to combine/coat and enjoy warm or let dry/cool completely on the pan (they'll crisp up as they dry/cool) before storing in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2-3 weeks (or in the freezer up to 1 month).These make an excellent snack or topper for things like smoothies, salads, oats, baked oatmeal, pancakes, and roasted sweet potatoes. They also make a lovely gift! Portion into small jars, tie with ribbon or twine, and give the gift of plant-based goodness."
278,Vegan Peanut Butter Cup Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Cup Cookies (V/GF)

Christmastime has always meant Christmas cookies.
My sister and I used to go to my aunt’s house and decorate sugar cookiesalong withan assortment of other goodies for our family’s Christmas dinner.
If you haven’t guessed yet, I’ve always had a bit of a sweet tooth. The only difference between 30-year-old me and 10-year-old me is a wee bit of self-control. I no longer eat 3 cookies before dinner and 13 after. I enjoy one or two – you know, the way a normal human should indulge.
Making strides, people, one year at a time.

These peanut butter cookies are adapted from my Fluffy Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookies – a must-try for the holiday baking season. This recipe requires just 1 bowl and less than 1 hour to prepare!
While sugar cookies will always have my heart, chocolate and peanut butter will forever be my favorite flavor combination. When you combine that into a cookie, I can barely contain myself. It’s a miracle I was able to hand off more than half of this batch to friends. They’re that good! Undetectably vegan and gluten free.

The base for these gems is peanut butter, aquafaba, vegan butter, and cane sugar. The flours are almond and my DIY gluten free blend, andcornstarch helps bind and puff these babies up into fluffy perfection.
All that’s left is a dairy-free peanut butter cup to smash into the center while they cool off. Then it’s straight into your mouth, where they will bring you so much joy you won’t be able to stand it.

I hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender
Peanut buttery
Chocolaty
Salty-sweet
Super indulgent
Insanely delicious
&amp; PERFECT
This is thee perfect cookie for cookie exchanges, holiday parties, or homemade gifts this holiday season. They won’t last long wherever you take them!

If it is too dry for some reason, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) almond milk and stir. Then transfer dough to the refrigerator and chill for 15 minutes*.Use a cookie scooper (I like this one) or Tablespoon to measure out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts of dough and gently roll into balls - the dough will still be soft, so be gentle. Arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheets and press down gently with the palm of your hand to smash slightly (see photo). The cookies won't spread much, so don't worry about giving them too much room on the baking sheet.Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the cookies appear fluffy and the edges are slightly beginning to dry out. Remove from oven and immediately press an unwrapped peanut butter cup down in the center of the cookies. Don't press too hard or it can crack too much. Be gentle - they only need to be inserted enough to stick in place. Let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely (expedite cooling time by transferring to refrigerator).Enjoy as is or with a glass of DIY Almond Milk or Hot Cocoa!

279,1-Bowl Gluten-Free Ginger Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Ginger Cookies (Gluten-Free)

True story: I was photographing these while our UPS guy was dropping off a package and hesaid, “Wow, those look good.” So I offered him one, and the next day he said, “Those cookies were BOMB.”
That just about sums it up.

These cookies are a play on my Fluffy 1-Bowl Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookiesand require just 1 bowl to make!
To get that quintessential warm holiday spice, they’re infused with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and molasses. Mmm.
Once mixed and chilled for 30 minutes, roll into balls, dip in cinnamon-sugar (my favorite childhood condiment), and bake to perfection. Then drizzle (or don’t, but do) with my simple 2-ingredient powdered sugar frosting.

I hope you all LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Tender
Perfectly spiced
Not too sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Seriously delicious
These would make the perfect treat to have on hand during the holidays and would even make great gifts, as they hold their shape nicely andwould package well.

280,Coconut Green Curry,"Vibrant Coconut Green Curry

When we traveledto Japan,we found this amazing restaurant called Mr. Farmer (recommended by my pal, Erin). It was a hidden gem that had tons of juices, smoothies, salads, and vegan fare, and I was in absolute heaven.
One of the dishes I enjoyed there no less than three times was a green curry so vibrant in color I was instantly obsessed. It was perfectly seasoned, creamy, and supercomforting when we were thousands of miles from home.
You know the rest of the story. Once we got home, I got straight into the kitchen to try my hand at recreating this dish. The results? Kind of amazing.

This recipe requires just 9 ingredients and comes together in roughly 30 minutes (without sides).
The green color in this dish comes from greens! I went with spinach, but I’m guessing you could easily opt for kale or even collard greens – whatever you have on hand.
And for the intense curry flavor I went with my DIY Curry Powder (that I’m putting on everything these days), which gets diffused and slightly sweetened with light coconut milk. Swoon.

Once the flavors simmer together for a while, transfer to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Then place back on the stove to warm until thickened and bubbly.
This curry was always destinedto be paired with brown rice, my Coconut Curried Greens, and my Crispy Tofu seasoned with DIY Curry Powder. How could I resist? The pairing is absolutely phenomenal. I ate the leftovers three nights in a row and was sad for the last bite to come.
If you’d rather, you could also add green lentils to the sauce for protein, vegetables of choice like mushrooms or bell peppers, or even eggplant. The sauce is so flavorful and creamy it would pair well with just about anything you can dreamup.

I hope you all LOVE this curry! It’s:
Creamy
Vibrant in color
Loaded with greens
Insanely flavorful
Versatile
Comforting
Healthy
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal for hosting or when you and your family are craving something a little more substantial yet still incredibly healthy. I highly, highly recommend pairing it with the sides I recommended, but it would also pair well with these Thai SpringRolls with Cashew Dipping Sauce.

","Heat a large, rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, garlic, shallot, and ginger. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until softened and slightly browned.Add curry powder and frozen spinach and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add coconut milk, coconut sugar, and sea salt (about 1/4 tsp to start).Heat over medium-high heat until simmering - about 4 minutes. Then remove from heat and carefully transfer the curry to a high-speed blender (or use an immersion blender). Blend on high, covering with a towel to prevent any leaks. At this time you can add some cornstarch or arrowroot starch to thicken and blend once more to fully combine. This is optional but does provide the sauce with more thickness/body.While still in the blender. taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more curry powder for intense curry flavor, sea salt for overall flavor, or coconut sugar for sweetness.Transfer curry back to the skillet or pot and heat over medium heat until bubbling. Then reduce heat to low and cook until slightly thickened - about 5-10 minutes.While the curry cooks, you can throw in vegetables of choice (i.e. red pepper, cubed sweet potatoes or squash, additional greens such as kale, etc.). But because I was serving mine with my Coconut Curried Kale and Crispy Tofu, I kept it more as a sauce than a stew.Serve curry with brown rice and desired sides/add-ins. Best when fresh, though leftovers store well in the refrigerator up to 4 days. I have not tried freezing this recipe, but I presume the sauce would freeze well up to 1 month."
281,Quick & Easy Crispy Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quick &amp; Easy Crispy Tofu (25 minutes!)

If you follow myInstagram stories you likely already know I’ve been tinkering with my How To Make Tofu Taste Good recipe to make the process even faster (20-25 minutes!).
I thought it wasn’t possibleto make crispy tofu without baking it for at least 30-40 minutes. But, I was wrong.
One night when I was super hungry and desperate for dinner fast, I tried this new-and-improved method and it worked so well I’ve sinceused this one exclusively! It’s that good. I don’t know why I didn’t think of this sooner. Plus, it easily carves5-10 minutes off of the originalmethodand includesthe opportunity to add more seasonings.

Step 1: Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) and wrap your extra firm tofu (this is important – anything less than extra firm won’t crisp up as fast or as well) and set something heavy on top like a cast iron skillet.

Step 2: Cube tofu and add to a mixing bowl. Season with salt and, depending on what type of dish you’re adding it to, season accordingly (i.e. curry powder for a curry dish, or a bit of tamari and/or chili garlic sauce for a stir-fry). I was adding mine to a green curry (coming later this week!), so I went with curry powder.

Step 3: Sauté in oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until browned on all sides (shaking the pan as needed to cook all sides).
Step 4: Finish baking in the oven for about 15 minutes or until crispy and golden brown. Mmmm, yes, please.
Now what? Add it to salads, curries, stir-fries and more! While seasoned well on the outside it will still benefit from a hearty sauce, like my stir-fry glaze,Almond Butter Tofu Glaze, or a NEW green curry sauce coming soon!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and wrap your extra firm tofu in an absorbent towel. Set something heavy on top - like a cast iron skillet - to press out extra moisture for 5 minutes.Unwrap tofu and cut into small cubes (see photo), then add to a medium mixing bowl and season with a pinch of salt and desired seasoning, which will vary depending on your dish. I was adding mine to a curry, so I added curry powder. If adding to a BBQ dish, try a BBQ seasoning blend. Or if adding to a Thai dish, try a Thai curry powder. If you want it to remain neutral in flavor and just crisp up, simply season with salt and skip the extra seasoning.Heat a large oven-safe metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the oil and the seasoned tofu. Sauté for 5 minutes, shaking/flipping occasionally to cook on all sides, until tofu has a slight crust on each side and has begun to brown.Transfer skillet to oven to bake for about 15 minutes, or until the tofu is firm to the touch and has begun to dry out and crisp up. The longer it bakes, the firmer it gets. I found the 15-minute mark to be about right.Now you have crispy tofu to add to virtually any dish you'd like! While the tofu is crispy and slightly seasoned, it does still benefit from a sauce, such as Peanut Sauce, my Almond Butter Glaze, a Curry Sauce, or my Garlic Dill Sauce. Best when fresh, but can be stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in a 375 degree F (190 C) oven until very hot."

You know those dishesthat are so insanely delicious you can’t help but go back for seconds and thirds, and you have to slap your own hand away for takingbites right off the serving plate?
Yeah, this is one of those dishes. Prepare yourselves for my latestcurry obsession: 30-minute AMAZING Coconut Curried Greens!

This recipe is super simple, requiring just 1 pan, 30 minutes and 10 ingredients. I even include a DIY curry powder seeing as I was out of my go-to jar and had to make my own. Spoiler alert: it’s gold dust and I want to put it on everything. Do it!
Besides the curry powder, we’re talking collard greens, kale, sea salt, coconut sugar, and light coconut milk. This combination of ingredients makes by-far the tastiest (and healthiest!) greens I’ve ever tried. These may very well be on weekly rotation in our house moving forward.

I hope you all LOVE this recipe. It’s:
Super flavorful
Loaded with greens
Richin plant-based protein + fiber
Savory-sweet
Insanely healthy
&amp; Absolutely delicious
Although these are great on their own, I think these greens would pair well with any of my curries: Coconut Red Curry with Chickpeas, Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower Wings, 1-Pot Sweet Potato Kale Curry, Green Curry with Chickpeas, Spicy Red Lentil Curry, 30-Minute Coconut Curry, Easy Chana Masala, Thai Yellow Curry with Mango, or my Coconut Curry Ramen. And, I have anothercurry coming next week that is the perfect match for these greens – stay tuned!

283,Fluffy Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy 1-Bowl Sugar Cookies (Vegan + GF)

We’ve officially reached the month of December and I have one thing on the brain: Cookies.
OK, cookies and somehow convincing John to get a real Christmas tree this year. The old fake one is looking real sad.
Send good vibes and tree care tips, please.

You may remember I made vegan gluten free cookies last year. However, with yet another year of recipe development under my belt, I’ve learned a lot since thenand have tried new techniques and gluten free flour blends. The result? I’ve cracked the code onperhaps the most fluffy, perfect gluten free vegan sugar cookies on the planet.
Big claims, I know. But kinda true.
Plus, this recipe is simple requiring just 1 bowl and less than45 minutesstart to finish. Ready to see this wizardly? Onward.

The base of these cookies is vegan butter, organic cane sugar and vanilla extract. For the egg, I went with aquafaba – the liquid left behind in a can of cooked chickpeas, which makes a lovely egg substitute in most vegan baking and whips up like egg whites! Magic, I know.
I hope to do a post on aquafaba soon as I get a lot of questions about it and recipe requests, so stay tuned! But if you follow my instructions below you’ll be fine.
Next comes my special blend of GF flours:
Almond flour (which creates a perfect crumbly texture)
Cornstarch (which puffs them up and providesshape + structure)
Andmy DIY Gluten Free Flour Blend(for extra binding)

The batter only chills for 15 minutes while the oven preheats, during which time you can make your frosting. These little dudes are also quite delicious plain if you’d rather keep things simple.
And may I add that these cookies are undetectably vegan and gluten free and are eerily reminiscent of Lofthouse sugar cookies!? Yeah, I know. Exciting stuff. Give them a try for yourself and let me know how it goes.

Continue adding powdered sugar until you have spreadable frosting (I used about 2 cups powdered sugar // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If you prefer a thinner frosting, add a little almond milk to thin. If it becomes too thin, add more powdered sugar. If it becomes too thick, add more almond milk. Add natural food coloring at this time (optional).Frost cookies or leave plain! I decorated with some naturally-dyed sugar sprinkles like these. Organic cane sugar as a base should ensure vegan friendliness.Storage: Once cooled, store leftover cookies covered at room temperature for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
284,Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garlic &amp; White Wine Pasta with Brussels Sprouts

This. Pasta. Tho.
I’ve made alfredo before, but this, this may be my new favorite.


What sets it apart? Garlic and white wine, which are infused into a classic white sauce paired with al dente pasta and roasted Brussels Sprouts. Now we’re talking.

This recipe requires 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make.
While the sauce is bubbling away and pasta is cooking to perfection, Brussels Sprouts are roasting until golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside. This is comfort food at its finest.


I hope you all LOVE this alfredo pasta! It’s:

Cheesy
Flavorful
Garlicky
Hearty
Comforting
&amp; Oh so delicious
This would make the perfect fancy weeknight dinner, or meal for hosting guests. We made this recently for friends – neither of which aredairy-free – and they devoured their whole plates.

If too thin, increase heat to medium to encourage thickening.Add Brussels sprouts to the oven and cook for 12-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown and tender, stirring once at the 10-minute mark to encourage cooking.Around this time, add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package instructions (mine took about 7-10 minutes, so I did that last. You want the pasta and Brussels to be done around the same time).Once cooked, drained pasta and add directly to the sauce, along with half of the Brussels sprouts and toss to combine.

285,Vegan Cornmeal Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Cornmeal Pancakes (7 Ingredients!)

How was your Thanksgiving? Ours was lovely. We’re visiting friendsand familyback in Kansas this week, eating all the delicious food and hatching our soloChristmas plans. Think sleeping in, PJs, and french toast and mimosas in bed. Mmm, dreamy.
In the meantime, let’s dig intothis seasonal stack of goodness. Fluffy cornmeal pancakes with cranberry orange compote. Let’s get into the kitchen.

These pancakes require just 7 ingredients and the compote comes together while the batter rests, making this a 30-minute recipe as well.
To keep these gluten free, I used a mixture of gluten free oat flour and cornmeal. Melted vegan butter adds decadence and a subtle buttery flavor.You can’t go wrong.
The compote is insanely simple. Just cranberries, orange juice and maple syrup bubbled into a compote and then blended.
Think tart-sweet in taste, and saucy + jammyin texture. Although the compote is optional, I highly recommend trying it out.
 
I hope you all LOVE these pancakes! They’re:

Return back to skillet/saucepan and keep warm over low heat until serving.Preheat your griddle or cast iron skillet over medium/medium-low heat. You want it warm but not screaming hot. Oil should not smoke when added to the pan.Once hot, drizzle the surface with oil or vegan butter and use a paper towel to wipe away excess - you don't want any pools of oil/butter. Then scoop scant 1/4 cup measurements onto the griddle or pan. Cook until bubbles appear and the sides are beginning to dry - about 3-4 minutes. Cook for another 2-4 more minutes on the other side.Place pancakes on a large plate and keep warm in a 200 degree F (93 C) oven until ready for serving - you should have 6 pancakes total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Top with cranberry-orange compote (optional) a drizzle of warm maple syrup.

The base is a double batch of my Perfect Vegan Cornbread or my Best Vegan Gluten Free Cornbread. Having made it with both cornbreads, I must say I slightly prefer the Perfect Vegan Cornbread version because gluten is so damn delicious. But, both work well here!
Next comes sautèed leeks and onions (celery is another nice optional addition), and simple 2-ingredient baked cranberries. The finishing touch is chopped pecans or walnuts for a bit of nuttiness and crunch.

Say hello to the sexiest cornbread on the block. Look at this gorgeousness! I hope you all love this stuffing. It’s:

","Make your double batch (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) cornbread at least 1 day in advance so it can be cooled, cubed, and then left to dry at room temperature uncovered for 24 hours. This keeps the stuffing from becoming mushy, and allows the cornbread to absorb more of the vegetable broth.Once your cornbread has been dried, begin by preheating oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and adding cranberries to a small baking dish. Top with water (or orange juice) and maple syrup. Toss to combine, then bake for 20 minutes, or until bubbly and soft. Set aside and reduce oven heat to 375 F (190 C).While cranberries are baking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil, onion, leeks and a healthy pinch of salt and black pepper. Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft and fragrant. Set aside.Add the dried cornbread to a large mixing bowl along with leeks, thyme, and pecans or walnuts (optional). Then add another healthy pinch each salt and black pepper and the vegetable broth, starting with half (1 cup or 240 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and working your way up to 2, stirring gently as you go. You aren't looking to make a purée out of the mixture, but rather gently toss and incorporate the flavors. I found 2 cups (480 ml) to be the perfect amount (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You want the cornbread to be moistened but not saturated.Add cranberries and gently stir once more (In the photos I added them at the very end, but after more testing found they get better incorporated when stirred in at this point).Transfer a greased 9x13-inch (or similar size // adjust number or amount if altering batch size) baking dish (like this one), and use a spoon or spatula to spread into an even layer. Cover with foil and bake 25 minutes, then uncover and bake another 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown.Let rest 5-10 minutes before serving. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator up to 5 days, though best when fresh."
287,Creamy Chickpea Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Kale Salad with Chickpeas &amp; Shallot

This salad came to my mind right as I wasfalling asleep.
Does your brain ever do crazy stuff like that? My best ideasseem to come when I’m about to doze off anddon’t have a notebook or pen to write things down, so I just make a pact with my brain to remember. And the next daywe both do our best to recallwhat we were thinking.
Thankfully, this one made it through the pipeline! Three cheers for my old lady brain still working!

I’ve made many a kale salad before, but this one is special. This is the answer to the question, “What’s super cozy, flavorful and perfect for Thanksgiving?”
This Mediterranean/Egyptian flavor pairing came to mind, and the recipe is adapted from my all-time favorite Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare!
The base is kale massaged with lemon juice and olive oil. Then comes freshly grated beets (which to me taste like candy in salads!). Next is pan-fried gluten free shallots that literally take 5 minutes, and Mediterranean baked chickpeas.
The final touch? Dukkah! Which is an Egyptian spice blend used to seasonsauces, protein, and things like this delicious salad! Dukkah isa totally optional ingredient but such a fun topper for this dish. It not only adds smoky, nutty flavor, but also a little crunch.

The dressing is SO easy (and dreamy).
Tahini is blended with fresh garlic, lemon juice, and maple syrup. Add water to thin and ‘voila!’ You have a super creamy, lemony dressing ready to coat those gorgeous greens. Look at that salad goodness.

I hope you all LOVE this kale salad! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Fiber- &amp; Protein-rich
Creamy + Crunchy
Super healthy
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect side dish forThanksgiving, or anytime of year, really. It yields two entrée-sized portions or 4 sides, so multiply as needed. Although it’s delicious on its own, it would pair extremely well with my Creamy FallSoup in Acorn Squash Bowls, and my Vegan Thanksgiving Wrap.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and add rinsed, (thoroughly) dried chickpeas to a small mixing bowl. Add oil, cumin, paprika, coconut sugar, oregano, turmeric, cinnamon, sea salt, cardamom and coriander (optional), and stir to combine.Spread on a bare baking sheet and bake for 22-27 minutes, or until deep golden brown and slightly crispy - they'll crisp up more as they cool.In the meantime, add shallot to the same small mixing bowl from earlier and top with brown rice flour and a pinch each salt and black pepper. Toss to coat and heat a cast iron or metal skillet over medium heat.Once hot, add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan and add shallot and all of coating. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until soft and light golden brown - about 4 minutes. Set aside.Make the dressing by adding tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and maple syrup to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add enough water to thin until pourable - about 1/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Whisk until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, salt + pepper for flavor balance, or maple syrup for sweetness. Garlic will add more bite/spice.Add kale to a large mixing bowl and top with oil and lemon juice. Massage with hands to soften and coat the kale for about 1 minute.If serving with dukkah, prepare by adding hazelnuts to a food processor and pulsing into a fine meal. Next, heat a skillet over medium heat and add sesame seeds. Toast/brown, stirring frequently, until the natural oils begin to release and they turn light brown and become fragrant. Then transfer to the food processor. To the still warm skillet add the coriander seed and toast until some of the seeds begin to pop and they are fragrant. Move off the heat and smash with a pestle or wooden spoon. Then add to food processor along with ground cumin, pepper and sea salt, cinnamon and coconut sugar (optional). Process to combine. Set aside. Store completely cooled leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature up to 3 weeks, though best in the first two weeks.To serve, add grated beets, chickpeas and shallot to the kale and top with several spoonfuls of dukkah (optional). Add half of the dressing and toss to combine. Divide between servings plates and serve with additional dukkah and leftover dressing. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days."
288,7-Ingredient Vegan Spelt Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Vegan Spelt Rolls

Carbs! Carbs! They’re here!
Allow me to present recipe #6 of Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza: Easy, Vegan100% Spelt Dinner Rolls. Ready your vegan butter friends – we have bread to bake.

I haven’t posted a recipe that’s not gluten freein a while because I’vebeen trying toavoidglutensince January to see if it’s causing of any of my health concerns (which I also wrote about inthis Cleanse review).
The jury is still out. I feel fine on the few occasions I have eaten it – i.e. no stomach cramps – but I’m still on the fence about whether it really adds any benefit to my diet. So for now, I avoid it.
With that being said,one exception I think I may make moving forward is whole grain, easy-to-digest flours like spelt or fermented sourdough bread on occasion.
Besides, making fluffy, Thanksgiving-worthy rolls gluten free is virtually impossible in my experience. So today, I make exceptions and indulge.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredientsand extremely simple methods!
The dough is a mixture of almond milk, yeast, cane sugar, salt, olive oil and spelt flour. After resting, roll into balls and topwith oats. Just a 1-hour rise before going into the oven where they bakeup to golden perfection (see above)!
I hope you all LOVE these fluffy, tender, slightly nutty spelt rolls that are reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory’s Whole Grain Bread (whichis kind of to die for). These are eerily close in texture and flavor.

","To a large mixing bowl, add 3/4 cup (90 g) spelt flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), yeast, sugar and salt. Whisk to combine.In a separate mixing bowl (or small saucepan over medium heat), microwave the almond milk, water, and olive oil until warm - about 110 - 120 degrees (~55 seconds). It should be the temperature of bath water. If it’s too hot, it can kill the yeast.Add wet to the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously or beat on medium/low for 2 minutes, scraping sides as needed.Add 1/4 cup (30 g) more spelt flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and beat for another 2 minutes. Then add only enough remaining flour to make a soft dough (I used slightly less than the full 2 cups called for // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (~1-2 minutes). Then place back in the mixing bowl, loosely cover, and let rest 10 minutes.Divide the dough into 10-11 equal pieces (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), carefully shape into balls (handling as little as possible), and place in a greased 8x8-inch baking dish or round cake pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place (such as on top of the oven or in a sunny spot) until doubled in size - about 45 minutes - 1 hour. Then sprinkle with oats.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) . Once the rolls have doubled in size (see photo) bake for 18-20 minutes, or until fluffy and light golden brown. Carefully brush with olive oil for a shiny appearance (optional).Let cool a few minutes, then serve as is or with vegan butter and jam of choice. Store leftovers covered at room temperature up to 3 days. See notes for freezing tips."
289,Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Roll | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Pumpkin Roll (GF)

Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza #5: CAKE!
What would Thanksgiving be without dessert (or any holiday for that matter)?
I’ve created so many pies forthe blog (Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spiced Apple Pie, Peanut Butter Cup Pie, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Pie, Chocolate Silk Pie, etc.) that I figured it was due time for an alternative.
Not to worry– it’s still pumpkin and it’s still delicious! Say hello to my latest creation/addiction: 1-Bowl Vegan Pumpkin Roll!

This recipe requiresjust 1 bowl! Yes, it’s that easy. The cake is a moist, pumpkin sheet cake adapted from my 1 Bowl Vegan Pumpkin Bread, meaning this cake is both vegan and gluten free!
Instead of a loaf pan, we bake it in a baking sheet so it’s flat and easy to roll up. But not before we make the filling…

The filling is a mash up of coconut whipped cream and vegan cream cheese!
It’s so insanely fluffy and creamy and sweet with a slight tang. In other words, it’s the perfect fillingfor this dreamy pumpkincake.

I hope you all love this cake! It’s:
Insanely rich
Tender
Pumpkin-infused
Not too sweet
Perfectly spiced
&amp; So satisfying
Enjoythis roll atThanksgiving and beyond. It would makebe the perfect cake for hosting, fall gatherings and holidays. Make it ahead of time and slice and serve, and watch as your friendsare ‘wowed’ by the flavor and your jedi cake rolling skills.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an 11x17-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, making sure the edges are completely covered. It's important to use a baking sheet that's close to these dimensions or the cake will be too thick or thin to roll (amount as original recipe is written // adjust size/number of baking sheets if altering batch size).Add banana to a large mixing bowl and mash. Then add aquafaba and whisk to combine. Next add muscovado sugar, maple syrup, oil, vanilla, and pumpkin purée and whisk to combine.Next add baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice, and mix. Add water and whisk once more.Add almond flour, gluten-free oats, and gluten-free flour blend, and stir until just combined (see photo). The batter should be thick and pourable. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more pumpkin pie spice for pumpkin flavor, or muscovado sugar for sweetness.Transfer batter to the parchment-lined baking sheet and spread into an even layer. It should be about 1/2-inch thick. Bake for 20-24 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the cake springs back to the touch.Let cool for 5 minutes. Then gently roll the cake from short end to short end, rolling the parchment paper up inside the cake and using it as a guide. Be very careful with this step and try to handle the cake as little as possible. Let cool to room temperature (otherwise the filling will melt).While the cake is cooling, quickly rinse your mixing bowl and add your chilled coconut cream. Whip using a hand mixer or whisk attachment until light and fluffy. Then sweeten to taste with powdered sugar. This should yield about 1 1/2 cups coconut whipped cream (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Next, add vegan cream cheese and beat to combine. Then add more organic powdered sugar to taste. I added another 1/4 cup (32 g) total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Cover and place in the refrigerator to chill.Once the cake has cooled to room temperature, carefully unroll and top with all of the coconut cream cheese mixture. Spread evenly over the cake, leaving about a 1/2-inch border along the edge.Very carefully begin rolling the cake back up the same way it was unrolled - from short end to short end - removing the parchment paper as you go (you don't want it inside the cake). Some filling will likely spill over when rolling - that's OK. Continue rolling, using the parchment paper as a guide until the cake is seam side down. Wipe away any excess filling that may have spilled over.Next gently roll/wrap the cake in plastic wrap and carefully transfer to a rectangular dish or cutting board and refrigerate until completely chilled and firm enough to handle easily - about 6 hours.To slice, carefully unroll from the plastic wrap and place on a serving dish. Then use a serrated knife (wiping it clean each slice) to carefully slice the roll into about 10 pieces (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Enjoy as is, or dust with a bit of powdered sugar.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best in the first 24-48 hours. I haven’t tried freezing this roll, but I would imagine it would freeze up to 1 month. Thaw before slicing."
290,Spicy Vegan Cheese Ball | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Vegan Pimento Cheese Ball

You guys. I made a cheese ball.
Yes, another cheese ball. But this one is spicy, so it’s totally my jam.
And guess what? Now you have something delicious to serve your dairy sensitive / vegan guests as they arrive at your party! Isn’t that grand?

This cheese is simple to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and surprisingly simple methods. If you can soak and blend cashews with spices and then wrap it in a towel, you can make this cheese. I believe in you – you got this.
The base is soaked cashews and vegan cream cheese for extra creamy texture and a little tang. The cheesiness comes from nutritional yeast, and the spicecomes from garlic, smoked paprika, pimento peppers, and cayenne pepper.
This combination of ingredients creates a seriously dreamy cheese ball that’s spicy – but not too spicy – and insanely flavorful.

Once the cheese has had some time to rest in the fridge, it becomes semi-firm and moldable, but remains creamy – that’s what you want.
This is an optional step, but I chose to coat mine in a blend of the spices for extra kick: paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne, salt, and chili pepper. Plus, look at that color! I couldn’t resist.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Creamy
Cheesy
Super flavorful
Perfectly spicy
Satisfying
Spreadable
&amp; So delicious
This would make the perfect appetizer for Thanksgiving, or anytime of year! It holds its shape for 2 hours outside of the fridge and keepsup to 5 days making this a great recipe to make ahead of time and set out just as your guests arrive. You so fancy.
Serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a dreamy combination. In my world, cheese +carbs = winning(even when it’s not “real” cheese.)

This is recipe #4 in my Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza – a series where I post a new recipe every day leading up to my Thanksgiving round-up on November 23. That way you’ll be completely covered for the big day. More to come, friends!

","Place cashews in a bowl and cover with cool water. Soak overnight or for at least 6 hours. If you can't get to them right away, drain, place back in bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. They will keep refrigerated for up to 2 days. Although not ideal for this recipe, you can also quick soak the cashews by covering with boiling hot water and soaking for 1 hour, then draining and proceeding with recipe as instructed.Once soaked, drain cashews thoroughly and add to your food processor (or a blender - though it's a little tougher to blend as there's not that much liquid added).Add minced garlic, garlic powder, lemon zest, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, salt and olive oil. Blend until very creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Then add vegan cream cheese, pimento peppers, smoked paprika and cayenne (optional). Blend once more until creamy and smooth.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon zest for tartness, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, garlic for zing, salt for saltiness, paprika for smokiness, or cayenne for heat. I added a bit more nutritional yeast, salt, cayenne and paprika. You want this to be super flavorful, so don't be shy!Place a fine mesh strainer (or colander) over a medium mixing bowl, and lay down two layers of cheesecloth (or a clean, fine, absorbent towel).Use a spatula to scoop all of the cheese over the cheesecloth, then gather the corners and twist the top gently to form the cheese into a ""disc."" Secure with a rubber band.Place in refrigerator to set for at least 6 hours, preferably 12-24, or until semi-firm to the touch. There likely won't be any liquid in the bowl, but the cheesecloth absorbs excess moisture and the cheese hardens in the refrigerator.To serve, unwrap from cheesecloth and gently invert onto a serving platter. Reform with hands or cheesecloth as needed.To make coating (optional), mix together nuts and spices and use hands to gently roll the ball around until coated. It is fragile, so handle gently.Enjoy immediately with crackers, vegetables or tortilla chips. I prefer this cheese with crackers or chips because it pairs better with carbs than vegetables in my opinion!Cheese will hold its form for 1-2 hours out of the refrigerator, but best when chilled. Leftovers keep well covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days."

In case you missed it, Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls and Roasted Squash, Pecan &amp; Pomegranate Salad are already on the table. What’s missing? Pasta salad!Let’s fix that.

Originally I had planned to make a traditional pasta salad modeled after this Vegan Macaroni Salad, but when I made the dressing it just wasn’tthe quite flavor combination I had in mind. I had a cravingfor pesto and decided to switchdirections.
This pasta salad is vegan and gluten free, comes together in about 30 minutes, and requires just 9 ingredients! This could be one of the last things you prepare for your Thanksgiving feast, or you can even makeit ahead of time and let it rest whileeverything else finishes upas the flavors seem to improvethe longer it hangs out.
The base is gluten free penne (I share my favorite brand below!), roasted tomatoes (use parchment paper while roasting unless you want a sad, blackened baking sheet like mine), and an insanely delicious and simple pesto dressing. Classic flavors, easy preparation, big flavor.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Creamy
Hearty
Cheesy
Super flavorful

292,"Roasted Squash, Pecan, & Pomegranate Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Roasted Squash, Pecan, &amp; Pomegranate Salad

Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza recipe #2?Squash!
Do you rememberwhat I didlast year? I made a Butternut Squash Sweet Potato Casserole (yes, a hot dish) for Thanksgiving. And? It was amazing! My aunts even made it at my grandma’s house for the big day! The Midwesterner in me was so proud.
I wanted to incorporate squash and sweet potatoes again this year, because, carbs. But I wanted to simplify and class things up a bit. Hence, a salad (made of mostly carbs)! Shall we?

The base of this 9-ingredient dish is roasted butternut squash and (or) sweet potatoes.
Roastwithcoconut oil, spices, and a little maple syrup and coconut sugar until golden and tender. It’s so delicious you’ll eat half before it’s ever assembled (according to a friend of mine – not me, of course).

While the squash is roasting, toast up some pecans and then – right on the pan – toss them with coconut oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup and spices and roast 5 minutes more until golden brown and crispy and SO DELICIOUS.
Again, my friend said she ate like half of them before serving. I can’tbelieve her. Such a lack of self-control.

For the dressing, I was hemming and hawing between savory, sweet, ortangy, until I remembered pomegranate molasses existed!
Have you ever tried it? It’s tangy and slightly sweet and so flavorful. I use it in my Fesenjanrecipe (find the vegan version in our Cookbook!) and it makes the dish.
You can either buy pomegranate molasses or make it at home by cooking down pomegranate juice into a semi-glaze consistency (like you would balsamic vinegar). It only takes about 20 minutes and you’re left with a 1-ingredient dressing that complements this “salad” beautifully.
For serving, I opted for a bed of arugula and red onion. But to behonest, it was just for color. You can definitely just serve the squash with pecans and pomegranate molasses and this would be a show stopper.
But it never hurts to sneak in more greens when you can (so they say).

I hope you all love this dish! It’s:
Festive
Hearty
Savory-sweet
Vegetable-packed
Nutrient-rich
&amp; So delicious
I’m envisioningthis beingthe “I can’t keep my hands off it” side dish this Thanksgiving (and all fall + winter long for that matter). If you’re more of a traditionalist, give my Butternut Squash Sweet Potato Casserole a try!
If you try this dish, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). If using both sweet potato and butternut squash, spread on different bare baking sheets (as they require different baking times // use more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size).To the squash and sweet potato add the coconut oil, sugar, cayenne, salt, cinnamon, and maple syrup and toss to combine.Bake the squash for 15-20 minutes, and the sweet potato for 25-30 minutes or until both are fork tender, sweet, and golden brown. Toss occasionally to ensure even baking.Add the pecans to a separate baking sheet and bake on a separate rack in the oven for 8 minutes. Then remove and add coconut oil, maple syrup, coconut sugar, cayenne, salt, and cinnamon. Use a spoon to carefully toss until well coated. Then return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes more, or until golden brown and fragrant. Set aside.While the vegetables + pecans are roasting, make the pomegranate molasses (if using store bought, skip this step), by adding pomegranate juice to a small saucepan and bringing to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue simmering until the liquid has reduced into about 1/4 cup. Pour into a serving dish - it will continue to thicken once cooled.To serve, either place the squash and pecans on a serving dish and drizzle with pomegranate molasses OR add the arugula to a serving bowl/platter and drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine. Then add onion, squash and/or sweet potato, pecans, pomegranate arils, and pomegranate molasses. Enjoy immediately. Best when fresh."
293,Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls

We’re in the final countdown to Thanksgiving festivities and I have yet to provide you with an entrée option. Not to worry! Acorn squash to the rescue.
PLUS,I have an exciting announcement! This is the first recipe in a week-long seriesI’m calling Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza, wherein I post a recipe every day leading up to my Thanksgiving Round-Upon November 23!
That’s right: EIGHT recipes that will cover your mains, sides, appetizers, and of course, dessert. Let’s start with this show-stopper of a main, shall we?

Last year when pondering a plant-based Thanksgiving entrée my mind immediately went to: What would I actually make and eat on Thanksgiving? And my Sweet Potato Chickpea Thanksgiving Wrap was the answer.
This year, I was craving something a little more festive, a little more colorful, and a little morecomforting.
So I made the easiest, creamy fall soup (ever) and served it in roasted acorn squash “bowls.” The result is a creamy, decadent, nutrient-rich soup that will “wow” guests and leave you feeling all warm and cozy inside.

Not only is this soup healthy and delicious, but it’s also easy to make, requiring just 10 basic ingredients you likely have on hand right now, and just 1 1/2 hours to prepare (including roasting acorn squash).
The base is a mixture of onion, garlic and your vegetables of choice! I went with a mixture of carrots and butternut squash, but pretty much any winter squash or hearty root vegetable will do here (think pumpkin and beets).

Next comes the fun part. Will you add lentils? Mung beans? Sage? Bay leaf? Or go with a curry adaption? You decide.
To keep things simple I added a little fresh sage and a bay leafto infuse plenty of classic fall soup flavor. And for a bitof protein and fiber I added red lentils because they cook quickly (in the soup!) and absorb flavors well.

While the soup is coming together roast your squash bowls until golden brown, tender and sweet. However, if squash bowls seem a little too over the top for you, you can totally skip this part and the recipe would become a 1-pot, 45-minute wonder. How cool is that?

I hope you all love this soup. It’s:
Creamy
Savory
Vegetable-heavy
Fiber- &amp; protein-rich
Full of flavor
Wholesome
Comforting
&amp; Delicious
I think this would make the perfect alternative Thanksgiving entrée or even a side. You could pair this with my Vegan Thanksgiving Wrap,White Bean KaleSalad with Tahini Dresingor Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, and a little Sangria for a classy, festive meal.
For more Thanksgiving ideas, I’ll be sharing a round-up next week. In the meantime, feel free to check out last year’s! Oh, and don’t forget the Pumpkin Pie or Bars!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and use a sharp knife to carefully halve acorn squash lengthwise. Do so by inserting the tip of the knife in between two ridges and pressing all the way through, then pushing/rocking the knife to slice through one half. Repeat on the other side.Scoop out seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop and drizzle with oil and maple syrup - rub with hands to distribute. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet or 9x13 inch baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then remove foil and bake for 30-40 minutes more, or until squash is fork tender and golden brown on the edges (baking time will vary based on size). Set aside.In the meantime, start soup. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, and garlic. Sauté for 4 minutes or until onion is softened, then add sweet potato, squash and/or carrots (I used butternut squash and carrots).Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper and stir. Sauté for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear slightly softened.Add vegetable broth and herb of choice (I used sage and bay leaf) and bring mixture to a low boil over medium-high heat. If adding lentils, add at this time.Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 20-30 minutes, or until lentils and vegetables are tender. Then use an immersion blender or transfer to the blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Return to pot if blended in blender.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding salt and pepper for flavor balance, herbs for earthiness, or a little maple syrup or coconut sugar for sweetness (I didn't find it needed it).Once acorn squash are baked, divide soup between the squash and garnish with topping(s) of choice - I went for sautéed kale* and red onion, but baked chickpeas, pomegranate, or cornbread (+ cornbread croutons) would work well here."

295,Creamy Pumpkin Pie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pumpkin Pie Bars (V + GF)

It’s pumpkin pieeeeee tiiiiiimme.
Only this version is naturally sweetened, has a no-fuss almond-oat crust, requires just 10 ingredients, and is made entirely in the blender.
Yeah, I’m bringin’ the heat (is that still something the kids say?).

While I do love atraditional pumpkin pie, this one may be slightly better because of the no-fuss crust! Just blend oats and almond flour and press into a baking dish instead of mixing with a pastry cutter, rolling and thentransferring the crust to a pie pan.
Ain’t nobody got time for that.

NEWS! I have an update for my go-to almond oat crust:Almond flour in place of whole almonds/meal.
Almond flour is made of blanched almonds instead of raw almonds and creates a lighter texture and less harsh almond flavor in baked goods. It’s an easy swapthat makes the crust even more perfect and undetectably gluten free!
I’ve found almond flour to be generally more expensive than almond meal, but I’ve found it’s worth it for the better texture and flavor. Plus, I’ve been ordering a 2-lb. bag of WellBee’s from Amazonfor a better price than store-bought and had great success with it! I did a little research and found out that not all almond flours are made equal, so I’d highly recommend trying this brand first!
I plan to use almond flour a little more around here, especially in gluten free baking as it seems to be superior (to almond meal) in gluten-free baked goods.
OK, onto the filling!

I hope you all love these bars! They’re:
Creamy
Pumpkin-y
Subtly spiced
Perfectly sweet
Wholesome
Naturally sweetened
&amp; Crazy delicious
These bars would make the perfect dessert to bring along to holiday gatherings. They’re so much easier to make than a traditional pie, yet deliver the same satisfying results!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper (adjust number/size of dish if altering batch size).Make crust by adding oats to a blender (or food processor) and blending/mixing until you reach the consistency of oat flour (if using raw almonds, mix them with the oats at this time).Add almond flour (not meal*), sea salt, coconut sugar and mix once more. Then add maple syrup and melted coconut oil and mix/pulse to combine. Depending on device, you may need to use a spoon to scrape around the edges to ensure the crust is completely mixed. If it appears or feels too dry, add more coconut oil.Add crust to the parchment-lined baking dish and shake to evenly disperse, then lay down parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object (such as a liquid measuring cup or drinking glass) and pressing down to pack the crust into place, making an even, firmly packed layer.Bake for 20 minutes, then set aside to cool.In the meantime, add all filling ingredients to the blender (or food processor) and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more maple syrup or coconut sugar for sweetness, or pumpkin pie spice for flavor. I also added a pinch of ground cinnamon. Set aside.Once the crust is baked, pour the filling into the crust and tap on counter to remove air bubbles. Bake for 50 minutes - 1 hour. The filling will still be just a bit jiggly, dark orange in color, and have some cracks on the top - this is normal.Remove from oven and let cool completely before loosely covering with plastic wrap or foil and transferring to the refrigerator to fully set for 4-6 hours, preferably overnight.Once cooled, gently lift bars out of dish and slice into 9 bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). I also sliced the edges off mine for appearance, but this is optional.Serve with coconut whipped cream and an additional sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or pumpkin pie spice (optional). Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3 days, though best when fresh."
296,Butternut Squash Portobello Tacos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Saucy Portobello &amp; Butternut Squash Tacos

You guys, there are no words.
These tacos are insane. Spicy, saucy, hearty, and utterly delicious.
This is a must-try!

These tacos were inspired by my love for fall and winter squash – especially butternut squash. Plus, they are easy to make, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare. What’s not to love?

The core ingredients are roasted, spiced butternut squash and saucy, sautéed portobello mushrooms. Black beans are optional but add an extra boost of protein and fiber, which I’m all for.
Let’s talk about the sauce tho.

This sauce is adapted from my Chilaquiles sauce from way, way back, that I’ve since adapted into my go-to enchilada sauce.
It’s smoky, hearty,perfectly spiced and marries the flavor of mushrooms and squash together beautifully.
In other words, yum.

I hope you all love these tacos! They’re:
Hearty
Saucy
Savory
Spicy
Vegetable-packed
Protein- &amp;fiber-rich
Healthy
&amp; So delicious
These would make the perfect dish to serve to guests or to feed your family on nights when you’re all craving a twist on classic tacos.
These are delicious on their own, but would also pair well with my Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups, Chipotle Black Bean Tortilla Soup,and Ginger Beer Margaritas. Just sayin’.

297,Green Pumpkin Pie Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Pie Green Smoothie

‘Tis the season for pumpkin everything.
Yes, even though October is over I’m still going strong with my pumpkin addiction and will be fora while. (Don’t even get me started on pumpkin butter – oy).
I partly blamethis pumpkin pie green smoothie. Can’t stop, won’t stop.

This smoothie comes together in 5 minutes, using1 blender, and requires just 6 ingredients.
And guess what? It tastes like pumpkin pie! You know, without all the crust and coconut whipped cream. But still…
The ingredients are SO simple you likely have them in your pantryright now. Pumpkin purée is blended with frozen, ripe banana, almond + coconut milk, pumpkin pie spice and spinach!
Two things are optional: A greens powder and protein powder (listed below).
Seeing as I’ve just posteda Vegan Protein Powder Review, I suggest two of my favorites for this smoothie. However, protein is optional! The addition just makes it more of a meal than a snack.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Cold
Pumpkiny
Perfectly sweet
Healthy
Refreshing
&amp; Insanely delicious
I couldn’t believe how delicious this smoothie was at first sip. It makes the perfect fall breakfast, post-workout recovery, or afternoon snack. If you aren’t into pumpkin, try it with Cinnamon-SugarApples,Matcha, or Mangoinstead!

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. If too thick, add more almond or coconut milk.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. For more pumpkin flavor, add more pumpkin pie spice. For more sweetness, add more banana, or a bit more vanilla protein powder - optional (or a bit of maple syrup, agave or stevia extract).Serve immediately.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and grease an 8x8-inch baking dish (adjust number/size of baking dish if altering batch size).Prepare flax egg in a small bowl and let set for a few minutes to achieve an ""eggy"" texture. Measure out almond milk and add lemon juice and let curdle for a few minutes. Then add baking soda and stir once more. Set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add melted butter and sugar and whisk vigorously to combine. Then add applesauce, flax egg, and whisk once more. Next add almond milk mixture and whisk vigorously again to combine.Next add salt, cornmeal, flour and stir with a spoon until just incorporated. It will look thin and somewhat lumpy. That's what you're going for.Add batter to prepared dishes and bake for 28-37 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into a center comes out clean.Let rest in the cooking dish for a few minutes before serving. I highly recommend serving these with just a touch of non-dairy butter and maple syrup or honey if not vegan.Will keep in an airtight container for up to a couple days. Store in the freezer to keep longer. These would go excellent with my 1-Pot Red Lentil Chili."
299,Lentil Eggplant Lasagna | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lentil &amp; Eggplant Lasagna

I scream, you scream, we all scream for…LASAGNA!
Isn’t that how it goes?
OK, I know it’s ice cream, but lasagna ranks up there for me on levels of food excitement.
Shall we make yet another healthy, vegan, gluten free version(e.g. – Eggplant RollUps, Zucchini Lasagna, SpaghettiSquash Bake)? Yes, I think we shall.

This lasagna is easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and extremely simple methods.
If you can slice an eggplant, toss lentils in a pot of marinara, and blend basil + tofu, you can master this recipe.

The base is roasted eggplant “noodles,” the “cheese” is my go-to tofu ricotta (although you could substitute macadamia ricotta!), and the sauce is my favorite store-bought marinara with red lentils simmered in for extra fiber and protein (although you could also make your sauce from scratch!).

Assemblyis the bestpart!
Layer sauce, noodles, cheese, sauce, noodles, cheese…..until you get to the top! Finish withsauce, noodles, sauce!
Bake for 45 minutes and you’re ready to dig in.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Hearty
Healthy
Cheezy
Saucy
Vegetable-packed
High in fiber (10.8 g/serving) + protein (10.7 g/serving)
&amp; Perfect for fall
This is the ideal dish to make this fall and winter when you’re craving something hearty yet healthy, ortoserve to guests. No one will miss the actual noodles or cheese!
This would also be an amazing dish to make on the weekend and take for lunch (or enjoy as leftovers) throughout the week. Enjoy as is, or with my favorite Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeasand/orSimple Pumpkin Soup.

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Also set out two baking sheets and one large (9x13-inch or similar) baking dish (sizes/amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Generously salt eggplant slices on both sides and arrange in a colander in the sink to remove excess water/bitterness for 15 minutes. (If using lasagna noodles, boil, drain and set aside.)Rinse salted eggplant slices well and dry thoroughly between two clean absorbent towels. Lay a baking sheet on top and place something heavy on top to absorb excess moisture.Arrange slices on 1-2 baking sheets in an even layer and drizzle with a little olive or grape seed oil. Bake in a 425 degree F oven for 13-15 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).While eggplant is baking, add marinara sauce and water to a large saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Then add rinsed lentils and lower heat to a simmer (low) and cook loosely covered (to prevent splattering), stirring occasionally, for about 15-20 minutes or until lentils are tender.In the meantime, make tofu ricotta. Add all ricotta ingredients to a food processor or blender and pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed. You want a semi-puréed mixture with bits of basil still intact.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, or lemon juice for brightness. I usually add a bit more of all three.Spread a thin layer of lentil marinara sauce into your baking dish. Then layer on a few pieces of eggplant (see photo).Spoon half of the ricotta filling over the eggplant slices and spread into an even layer. Then top with another layer of marinara sauce. Repeat until you have used up all the ricotta. NOTE: The top layers should be: Marinara, eggplant noodles, marinara.Sprinkle the top with vegan parmesan cheese (optional) and cover with foil. Bake at 375 F (190 C) for 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake for 10-15 minutes more, or until the sauce is bubbly and warm and the top layer is very slightly browned (see photo).Let rest for 10-15 minutes. Then slice with a serrated or very sharp knife, and serve with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh basil (optional).Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Reheat in the oven or the microwave until warm. You can freeze the dish up to 1 month: Prepare up until baking and then thaw slightly before baking at 375 F (190 C) until warmed through."
300,Gluten-Free Onion Rings | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Onion Rings

It’s that time of year when weput on our stretchy pants, watch sporty things (or copious amounts of Netflix), and eat all the comfort food.
Care to join?


Anytime we go out to eat I’m tempted by the appetizer menu.
However, I always end up passing because 1) there aren’t many veg/gluten free options and 2) portion sizes are typically mammoth so there’s no way I’ll be able to finish myentrée with a stack of onion rings already down the chute.
But – but – there is a time and a place for comfort food. And that time is now. When myfavorite fall shows return, the weather gets chilly, and I get a serious case of introversion.

These rings are simple to make, requiring just 9 ingredients and 30 minutes to make!
Simply slice onions into rings and dredgein a mixture of brown rice, cornmeal, salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne pepper. It’s as easy as that!
To cook, I went for pan frying, because I never met a baked onion ring I liked. In fact, I tested a baked version of this recipe and it was a total no go. Burnt on the outside, stringy on the inside, and the coating fell off (saddest day).

I hope you all LOVE these rings! They’re:
Crispy, crunchy
Savory on the outside
Sweet on the inside
Perfect spiced
Comforting
Indulgent
&amp; Kind of amazing
These would make the perfect snack or appetizer for a day spent watching sporting events or Netflix re-runs, especially when paired with my Whiskey BBQ Ketchup or Vegan Chipotle Aioli (pictured above)!

","Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (93 C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Place one in the oven (where you'll place cooked onion rings) and one on the counter (where you'll place dipped onion rings). Also set out a plate layered with a few paper towels.In a large shallow bowl, mix together brown rice flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Also add dairy-free milk to a separate small mixing bowl and set aside.One at a time, dip the onion rings in the dry ingredients first, then the dairy-free milk, then back in the dry ingredients until well coated. Place on the parchment-lined baking sheet on the counter and repeat until all rings are dipped. Overlapping them a little is fine.Heat a large cast iron or metal skillet over medium high heat and add enough oil to form a scant 1/2-inch layer. Heat for 3-5 minutes, or until a little flour sprinkled in bubbles and browns. At that point, add only as many onion rings will fit comfortably in the pan.Fry on both sides for 1-2 minutes, turning down heat if browning too quickly. Flip with a fork and handle carefully as the coating can be fragile at this point.Transfer cooked onion rings to the paper-towel lined plate to blot off extra oil, then onto the parchment-lined baking sheet in the oven to keep warm. Continue until all onion rings are cooked.Serve immediately with dip of choice - Whiskey BBQ Ketchup or Vegan Chipotle Aioli. Best when fresh."

Whoa, guys. Like whoa.
Chipotle aioli with 5 ingredients?
This calls for a french fry and veggie burger party.

This dip has been a long time in the making.
Any time we go to a restaurant, my eyes always go to the sauce section. I’m a sauce freak and always hope they have some dairy-free options.
My favorite dip – besides ketchup, obviously – is chipotle aioli. It’s creamy, it’s salty, it’s spicy – it’s everything.
This is my 5-ingredient, vegan, gluten-free restaurant-inspired version.

I tried using chickpea brine as a base to whip up a “mayo-” like texture, but it failed miserably. Trusty cashews never let me down.
The rest is simple: lemon juice, salt, water (or almond milk), and a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.
The result is an insanely creamy, savory, spicy “aioli”perfect for:
Grillable Veggie Burgers
Sweet Potato Black Bean Burgers
Mexican Green Chili Burgers
Sun-dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers
Chickpea + Sunflower Seed Sandwich
Cajun Sweet Potato Fries
Crispy Matchstick Oven Baked Fries

302,Eggplant & Almond Butter Tofu Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sesame Eggplant &amp; Almond Butter Tofu Bowls

It’s been a few months since we’ve been in our new (and first!) home, but I still get nostalgic about our old neighborhood even though it’s just 10 minutesaway, and our new neighborhood is pretty awesome as well.
In our old apartment, we were super close to a Boké Bowl – a healthy, Asian, “fast food” restaurant in Portland. My favorite dish there was definitely the tofu rice bowl. Tender, sticky rice, perfectly fried tofu, seared eggplant, and kimchi.
It was so delicious I knew I had to recreate it at home. Consider this my inspired version.

This dish requires just 30 minutes to make, and it can be modified to taste and what’s in season.
Currently, I’m digging on eggplant (these are little Japanese eggplant!). But you can also go for something like sugar snap peas, squash, or bell pepper if that’s more your thing.
The base is rice, the protein is my go-to almond butter tofu, and the toppings are abundant. Kimchi strongly recommended.


This dish is like a hug from fall. It’s:
Hearty
Comforting
Saucey
Vegetable-packed
Protein- + Fiber-rich
Quick
Healthy
&amp;Insanelydelicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something healthy yet satisfying. It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair especially well with my 20-minute Asian Kale Salad, or these Healthy Spring Rolls!

Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover with a secure lid, and cook for 20-25 minutes. Set aside.Prepare the tofu sauce in a medium mixing bowl by whisking together sesame oil, almond butter, tamari, lime juice, maple syrup, and crushed chili (or chili garlic sauce). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more tamari for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, chili pepper for heat, or maple syrup for sweetness. Set aside.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and cut pressed tofu into small rectangles. Toss in cornstarch (they should be well coated) and sauté in 2 Tbsp sesame oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), flipping once browned on the underside to ensure even browning – about 5 minutes total.Add the almond butter sauce (see photo) and stir to combine. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring gently to ensure even cooking on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside.To the still hot pan - over medium-high heat - add 1 Tbsp sesame oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and once hot, the eggplant. Drizzle with tamari, maple syrup and sesame seeds (optional) and sauté, stirring frequently for 2-3 minutes or until browned on all sides.To assemble, divide rice between serving bowls (2-3 as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with eggplant, tofu and other desired toppings, such as fresh vegetables, Asian pickles, Kimchi, or chili garlic sauce.

As the temperatures dropand the days get shorter, all I craveis tea and soup. Tea and soup.
No literally, just tea and soup. Oh, and hot showers and hot cocoa. I basically hibernate like a bear all winter.

While John and I don’t agree on all food choices (he hates sweet potatoes, but they’re my only love), we do agree that ramen is where it’s at and frequently seek it out for dinner – especially in the fall and winter.
I love how savory and comfortingit is, and how amazingly full I get on broth, rice noodles and vegetables. It’s magic.
I loved makingvegan ramen last year andwanted to try it again. But this time, the broth was inspired by our go-toPortland ramen shop, Boxer Ramen.
Their vegetarian broth is insanely delicious and has a unique flavor profile. Although I was skeptical at first, the coconut curry infusionjust makes sense. It adds a whole other dimension to the broth – warmth, spice, slight sweetness. I’m in love.
Consider this my inspired version that requires just 10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour to make.

I hope you guys LOVE this ramen! It’s:

Then add vegetable broth and coconut milk and stir to deglaze the bottom of the pan.Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding coconut sugar for a little sweetness, turmeric for more intense curry flavor, or more sesame oil for nuttiness.About 10 minutes before serving, prepare any desired toppings/sides, such as noodles, sautéed portobello mushrooms, or green onion (optional).Just before serving, scoop out 1/2 cup of the broth and whisk in the miso paste. Once fully dissolved, add back to the pot and turn off the heat. Stir to combine.Either strain broth through a fine mesh strainer (discard onions and ginger or add back to the soup) or ladle out the broth and leave the onions and mushrooms behind.To serve, divide noodles of choice between serving bowls. Top with broth and desired toppings. Serve with chili garlic sauce or sriracha for added heat.Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separate from sides/toppings) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month."
304,Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Pumpkin Cake (Vegan + GF)

How is it mid-October already and I’m only just now postinga pumpkin recipe? Can you forgive me?
Please say yes. Please say yes. Please be my friend.

This pumpkin cake is inspired by fall and my love for all the pumpkin things and my Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread.
It’s simple, requiring just 1 bowl to make! And it comes together in about 1 hour.How cool is that?

I’ve been doing more experimenting withaquafaba as an “egg” in gluten-free baking and it’s working wonders. This cake is another proud accomplishment in my line of testing vegan/gluten free goods. Oh joy (and more to come).
The base is whipped aquafaba (chickpea brine) and coconut sugar, which keeps this cake entirely naturally sweetened! Cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice amp up the fall flavor, while pumpkin puree and banana add incredibly moist texture and natural sweetness.

The result is a fluffy, tender, pumpkin-infused cake laced with rolled oats and almond flour.
As for the gluten-free blend, Iwent with a light blend I’ve been loving lately. But I feel pretty confident that, as long as it’s a rice-based blend, it should do well here! And of course, if you’re not gluten-free, feel free to sub spelt flour, whole-wheat flour, or unbleached all-purpose for the gluten-free blend.

I hope you all LOVE this cake! It’s:
Tender
Fluffy
Wholesome
Naturally sweetened
Pumpkiny
Perfectly-spiced
Hearty
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect cake for entertaining this fall or if you just want something special on hand for a lazy weekend.

Whoa. Like whoa.
Guys, you’ve never had lasagna like this before. Trust me.

What sets this 8-ingredient lasagna apart from the rest is two things: Veggie ‘noodles’ and a brand new-to-me vegan ‘ricotta cheese.’
Have you guys tried macadamia nut ‘cheese’ yet? You know how I love my tofu ricotta, but this macadamia version is ridiculously easy (no soaking required!) and very close in flavor and texture to the real thing!
Plus, it turns out all fluffy and cheesy and green from fresh basil. Ooh mama.

In place of noodles, I opted for ribboned (thinly sliced) zucchini squash, but you could also sub eggplant,sweet potatoes or gluten-free lasagna noodles.
You could also use the macadamia ricotta to adapt my Spaghetti Squash Lasagna Bakefor another delicious lasagna-inspired dish!

306,Vegan Gluten-Free Cornbread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Cornbread

Growing up, cornbread was one of my favorite side dishes, especially alongside chili. My mom would serve it with butter and maple syrup and I would go nuts. It’s no wonder – I’ve always loved carbs.

In the past few yearsI’ve attempted vegancornbreadwith success. However, I had yet to crack the code on vegan, gluten-free cornbread.
Without eggs, gluten-free baked goods tend not to rise and miss that crumbly texture necessaryin cakes and quick breads.
However, recently I hopped on the aquafaba bandwagon and things have changed. Unless you’ve been napping for the last year, you’ve likely heard of aquafaba – the starchy brine left behind in a can of chickpeas (or other beans, such as white and kidney beans).
The brine has the protein and wizardry necessary to mock an egg and even whip up and bake into things like meringues and pavlova! It’s kind of amazing.
While I haven’t perfected my meringue or played around much with aquafaba as a stand-alone ingredient (yet), I have been loving it as an egg substitute in gluten-free baking.

This recipe is easy, requiring just 10 basic ingredients. Plus, it’s extremely simple if you know how to turn on a hand mixer and whip up egg whites.
Aquafaba behavesthe exact same as egg whites, creating a stable base and binding agent for this fluffy, perfect cornbread.

I know some of you may be temptedto sub out the organic cane sugar for a more natural sweetener, but I would beg you not to do so.
The texture and flavor of the cornbread is compromised when things like coconut sugar or maple syrup are subbed in and I know this by experience. The only thing that might work is subbing stevia for 1/4 cup of the sugar. Otherwise, I hope you’ll try it and love it as is!

I hope you all LOVE this cornbread! It’s:
Fluffy
Tender
Crumbly
Perfectly sweet
Easy to make
&amp; Ideal for fall + winter!
This is the perfect hearty comfort food to have on hand this fall and winter to pair alongside dishes like 1-Pot Vegan Chili, Vegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich, and Vegan Sloppy Joe’s! In my opinion, it’s almost undetectably vegan and gluten-free so everyone can enjoy (but no one will be able tell the difference). If not gluten free, try my Best Vegan Cornbread for 2!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease a standard 9-inch round cake pan or 8x8-inch baking dish and dust with gluten-free flour. Shake out excess and set aside. (I also think you could use an 9-inch cast iron skillet, but it wouldn't come out as easily and will likely have to be served directly from the pan).In a liquid measuring cup, measure out non-dairy milk and add vinegar or lemon juice. Set aside.Add chickpea brine to a medium mixing bowl and begin whipping until loose peaks form. Then add sugar in a little at a time and beat until the texture is glossy and white and semi-firm peaks form.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then add almond milk mixture and oil and whisk once more. Lastly, add the whipped chickpea brine (with sugar) and gently whisk/fold in until a thick but pourable batter is formed.The batter should be thick but pourable. Add more cornmeal or gluten-free flour if too wet or almond milk if too thick. I added 1 Tbsp more cornmeal and 2 Tbsp more light gluten-free flour blend (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add batter to prepared cake pan and bake on a center rack for 25-35 minutes, or until the edges are light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean.Let cool completely in the pan - set on a wire rack to speed cooling process. To remove, run a dull knife around the edge of the cake pan to loosen, then slice and serve. Alternatively, place a plate on top and quickly invert. It will be upside down so flip onto another serving platter to get it right side up.Serve with vegan butter and maple syrup. Pairs extremely well with hearty dishes like Vegan Lentil Chili.Store covered at room temperature for 2-3 days, or in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Freeze up to 1 month."
307,Vegan and GF Apple Pie Crumble Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Apple Pie Crumble Bars (Vegan + GF)

Wow. Apple season is here (at least in the Pacific Northwest!) and I couldn’t be more thrilled.
When I worked at a sandwich shop in college, I used tobring a granny smith apple in every day for my mid-morning snack. I literally ate an apple a day everyday for, like, two years. That’s love!

This recipe takes my love for apples into new territory. They remind me of apple crisp and apple pie and apple strudel all wrapped into one! Plus, just 10 ingredients and 1 hour required before these delicious Apple Pie Crumble bars are on your plate. Let’s do this!

The crust is my go-to almond oat crust that knows no bounds. I’ve now used it to make Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble Bars, Baked Vegan Cheesecake, Peanut Butter and Jelly Snack Bars and soon-to-be more fall treats! Stay tuned.
I love it because it’s simple: Oats, almonds, coconut sugar, salt, and coconut oil. That’s it! And when it bakes up it’s reminiscent of graham cracker crust but without all the weird ingredients and preservatives.

The apples are tossed in cinnamon, lemon juice, and coconut sugar before they’re pre-baked for that quintessential tender, tart-sweet apple pie texture.
And the topping is easy, too! Simply mix coconut sugar, oats, gluten-free flour, and coconut oil together and crumble over the top for a crumbly, slightly crisp topping.

All that’s left is slicing and topping with an optional 2-ingredient powdered sugar and almond milk glaze! In my opinion, this really sends these bars over the top.
But they would be equally delicious as is or topped with Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream or Coconut Whipped Cream! I think they would also be amazing with my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from the cookbook!

Toss to combine.Cover with foil and bake for 18 minutes. Then remove foil and bake for 4-5 minutes more or until apples appear slightly caramelized and are tender to the touch.While the apples finish baking, add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a food processor or high speed blender and pulse into a fine meal, making sure no large pieces remain.Add melted coconut oil and pulse a few more times until a crumbly dough forms that resembles wet sand and sticks together when squeezed between two fingers.Spread the mixture into the baking dish and press down into an even layer with your fingers or a flat object (such as a drinking glass or liquid measuring cup).Bake for 15 minutes at 350 (176C), then increase heat to 375 degrees F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more, or until the crust is fragrant and the edges are light golden brown.

308,1-Pot Chickpea Shakshuka | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Chickpea Shakshuka

During our time in Vancouver, we tried lots of delicious restaurants, one beingMedina – famous for its brunch.
The long line was worth the wait on a cold dreary morning and all I was craving was a hot beverage and a comforting pot of something warm and delicious. One bite into thetagine (a close cousin to the North African dish known as “shakshuka”) and the smoky, intenseflavors in the tomato sauce, I was hooked!
I got to work recreating this dish once we returned home.

This 30-minute, 1-pot meal starts with a mixture of onions, garlic, and bell pepper. Next comes tomato puree (or diced tomatoes) and tomato paste for plenty of rich, hearty flavor.
Seasonings can practicallybe whatever you have in your pantry, but I felt thatcumin, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, coriander, and cardamom worked best, giving the dish a smoky, earthy, rich, and comfortingflavor.

Next comes cooked chickpeas and olives to provide a little more saltiness and substance. Plant protein to the rescue!
This dish is quite amazing. It’s:
Smoky
Tomato-y
Rich
Hearty
Spicy
Comforting
Vegetable-forward
Protein- &amp; fiber-rich
&amp; Insanely easy to make!
This is the type of plant-based meal that can be enjoyed at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. From what I gather, shakshuka is traditionally a baked egg dish, but I swapped in chickpeas for the protein. Serve with toasted bread, flatbread, or over rice, cauliflower rice, or gluten-free pasta of choice! I think this pairs especially well with my Garlicky Chickpea Kale Salad.

309,Vegan Chocolate Malt (3 Ingredients!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Vegan Chocolate Malt

You get a malt.
You get a malt.
You get a malt.
Everybody gets as malt!
Don’t mind me. I just think saying things in an Oprah voice will never not be funny.

Did you know I used to bean ice cream scooper? In high school, I worked in a movie theatre witha restaurant inside and I made all the milkshakes, cherry limeades, sundaes, etc. It was a hard job, but someone had to do it (poor, poor me).
One of my favorite things to make waschocolate malts. To behonest, if there was a little extra leftover, it totally went into my cup. Shhh, don’t tell my old boss. I’m sure there’s still some way I’d get in trouble for that.

This, however, isn’t your average malt.
For starters, just 3 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes required.
Second, it’s dairy-free thanks to Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream (hubba).
Third, it’s made with HOMEMADE Vegan Chocolate Syrup (that’s naturally sweetened)!
Lastly, the malt flavor doesn’t come fromsome mystery powder (what is that stuff anyway?). It’s thesuperfood maca.

Maca not only adds antioxidants and amino acids and rainbows and unicorns (I kid, I kid), it also adds a smoky, malty flavor that is reminiscent of a traditional malt. Yipee for healthy swaps!

Look at that swirl, tho.
I hope you all love this malt! It’s:
Creamy
Thick
Perfectly
Super chocolaty
Malty
&amp; Oh-so delicious
This is the perfect dessert to make when you want to indulge while alsoreaping a fewhealth benefits. Not into chocolate (who are you?)? Leave it outandgo for vanilla! Or add some strawberries for a fruity twist. Dream big, people.
This recipe is a great gateway into the world of maca powder, which can also be added to things like coconut yogurt, hot chocolate,chia pudding, and smoothies!
If you try this recipe, let me know! I love your comments, ratings, and (as always) your photos tagged #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!

","Add ice cream, chocolate syrup, and maca powder and blend on low until creamy and smooth. If it has trouble blending, add a bit of almond or coconut milk (I didn't find it necessary and prefer my malts thick).Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chocolate syrup for intense chocolate flavor or maca for a more ""malty"" flavor.Enjoy as is or top with coconut whipped cream and more chocolate syrup (optional). Best when fresh."
310,7 Minute Vegan Chocolate Syrup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Minute Vegan Chocolate Syrup

Oh, hey there, sexy stream of (naturally sweetened) vegan chocolate syrup on my ice cream. How do you do?

Do I need an excuse to make chocolate syrup? I think not, hence the reason I devised a plan to make a simple, homemade, healthier version in just 7 minutes with 5 ingredients in 1 pot. Hooray!

This isn’t just any chocolate sauce. It’snaturally sweetened thanks to maple syrup (or stevia), and cocoa butter in place of dark chocolate. The result is a perfectly sweet, slightly creamy, ultra chocolatey sauce that’s so much better than storebought.

I LOVE this sauce and I hope you do, too! It’s:
Creamy
Chocolaty
Rich
Simple
Naturally sweet

As you may know, I’ve made many curries before (see them here, here, and here), but this may very well be my favorite. Yes, big statement, but very true.
Plus, this is a 1-pot, 30-minute recipe that screams comfort food and fall and all of the cozy things. You know how I feel about fall.

This recipe was inspired by my love for the combination of anything kale and sweet potatoand my intense passion for putting curry paste in and on everything. Get on board.

This recipe starts with coconut oil, ginger, pepper, garlic, and red curry paste. Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness, and maple syrup and turmeric add flavor and balance out the heat.
I love how the sweet potato and kale marry perfectly together to create a tender sweetness with a dose of earthy greens. Talk about two superfoods in one pot.
Next comes a few green peas and cashews for a kick of plant-based protein.

I hope you all love this curry! It’s:
Simple
Savory
Perfectly spiced
Naturally sweet
Hearty
Comforting
Healthy
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something hearty yet healthy.

312,Red Curry Cauliflower Wings | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower “Wings”

OK, guys. This is big.
Have you tried cauliflower wings? They’ve been a thing on the internet for a while, but I only recently gave them a try. And before you roll your eyes and say cauliflower isn’t your wing (get it? It’s a pun) or vegetable of choice, hear me out. This is one recipe you don’t want to miss.

While I haven’t tried the traditional“hot wing” recipe using hot sauce yet, this one by Hot For Food looks amazing and I used it as a basis for developing this recipe.
The original idea for these wingscame from a reader (hi!) who requested a recipe for curry-spiced cauliflower breaded in chickpea flour and served with chimichurri sauce – a beloved dish from a local restaurant in their area.
I tried to wrap my brain around that concept, did a little research on chickpea breading methods, and then got to work. Spoiler alert – the results were mind blowing.

This recipe requires just 9 ingredientsyou likely have on hand right now.
Cauliflower may bea cruciferous veg that gets mixed reviews from people, but I happen to love it (have you tried this masala spiced tofu scramble yet?).
It’s coated in a brown rice- (or chickpea flour-) based batter seasoned with curry powder and tandoori masala spice blend. YUM.

First, it’s baked to roast the cauliflower until slightly softened. And then the fun part – tossing in a curry paste glaze!
It’s simple: red curry paste, maple syrup, coconut oil, and a little water.
The result is abeautiful red sauce that coats the cauliflower before it’s thrown back into the oven and roasted until golden brown, sticky, and all kinds of delicious.

The chutney sauce is optional, but I highly recommend it! Plus, it’s easy and comes together while your wings are roasting.

I hope you guys LOVE these wings. They’re:
Spicy
Saucy
Tender
Sticky
Super flavorful
Easy
&amp; Insanely delicious
How does one enjoy cauliflower wings? As a snack, appetizer, side to curry or salads, when the “big game” is on (or whatever the sporting folks say). I personally devouredthese as a late lunch. However you enjoy them, you can’t go wrong.
If you try this recipe, you have to let me know how it goes! I love seeing your comments, ratings, and your photos tagged #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 450 F (232 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (important or the wings will stick).Next, prepare batter. Mix dry ingredients together, and then add almond milk and lesser amount of water to start (6 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Stir with a whisk or fork until well combined. You want the batter thick but pourable so it can adhere to the cauliflower - too runny and it won't stick. Add only enough water until you reach the right consistency. Add more brown rice flour if it becomes too thin.Once the oven is preheated, add the cauliflower to the batter to coat. Shake off excess and place on baking sheet. Give each piece 1 inch of room to prevent sogginess. Depending on the size of your cauliflower this may require cooking on two baking sheets or in two batches (or more if increasing batch size).Bake for 25 minutes. In the meantime prepare the sauce by whisking together curry paste, coconut oil, and maple syrup. Add just a bit of water to thin so it resembles a glaze consistency.Once the cauliflower has finished baking, remove from oven and dip/toss in the glaze 1-2 pieces at a time. Shake off excess, then place back on baking sheet and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until browned on the edges and the glaze has caramelized.While baking, prepare chutney (optional), by adding all ingredients to a blender and blending until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more garlic for zing, salt for saltiness, maple syrup for sweetness, or water to thin.Let cauliflower cool slightly and then serve immediately. Best when fresh. The wings can be frozen (either at the glazed stage or the glazed and baked stage) and then reheated in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through."

Fall is just around the corner here in the northwest and I can barely contain my excitement for it all. Are you ready for all the apple and pumpkin things?
Let’s get started with an apple piesundae, shall we?

This naturally sweetened apple pie sundae is what I go for when I’m craving apple pie but don’t actually want to make a whole pie (namely the crust).
I learned this technique from my mom (thanks, Mom!). Simply peel and slice apples and cook on the stovetop with a little cinnamon and (coconut) sugar until tender, and then turn up the heat at the end to slightly caramelize. Works like a charm. It’s the perfect way to get your apple pie fix in 30 minutes.

While your apples are cooking, roast up some cinnamon sugar pecans.
This all happens on one baking sheet – the lazy girl’s dream!Simply roastfor a few minutes. Then top with cinnamon, coconut sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt and toss. Roast foranother few minutes and you have insanely gorgeous, roasty, toasty pecans on your hands. Yum.
These are perfect for salads, snacking, or this sundae (I can’t wait, you guys).

All that’s left is scooping upyour Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Creamor Coconut Whipped Cream. We’re so close I can taste it.
Caramel sauce is completely optional but does send this sundaeover the top. Either thin Date Caramel onthe stove top with a little maple syrup or go for my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from our Cookbook! It’s insanely delicious, naturally sweetened, and perfect for just about every dessert you can think of.

I hope you all love this sundae! It’s:
Fruity
Cinnamon-y
Perfectly sweet
Warming
Comforting
Quick to make
&amp; Insanely delicious
Consider this the perfect dessert to welcome fall and make good use of all those apples. Because it comes together so quickly, it would be totally suitable for weeknights, but it is special enough to be reserved for weekends or hosting as well.

Then remove from oven, top with coconut oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt and toss with a spoon or spatula until evenly coated (I like doing this on the pan to save time/mess, but you can also do this in a mixing bowl). Bake for 3-6 minutes more, or until fragrant and deep golden brown. Be careful not to burn. Set aside.While the pecans are baking, add coconut oil and apples to a large, rimmed skillet and begin cooking over medium heat. Add coconut sugar, cinnamon, ginger, lemon juice, and arrowroot or cornstarch (optional) and toss/stir to combine.Cover the apples and reduce heat to medium-low to soften for about 10-15 minutes - stirring occasionally.Once the apples are tender and soft (sample one to check), remove cover and increase heat to medium. Sprinkle on a bit more cinnamon and coconut sugar and stir to coat. Cook for 2-4 minutes more - this will add a slightly sticky, caramelized finish to the apples. Set aside.To make sundaes, divide apples between serving dishes and top each with 1-2 scoops of Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream (homemade or storebought). Garnish with pecans and sprinkle with pecans.Optional: Serve with Date Caramel, heated on the skillet and slightly thinned with maple syrup OR my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from our Everyday Cooking Cookbook!Best when fresh.

However, I don’t like the words “casserole” or“hot dish.” Hearing them conjures up images of church basements and mystery potlucks. So, instead, why don’t wecall this a bake? Glad you’re on board.

This recipe screams fall and the holidays. Am I jumping the gun on fall-themed dishes? I say no.
Cauliflower and broccoli are in my part of the world at the moment and I’m puttingthem to good use recreating one of my favorite side dishes.
Anything with broccoli covered in“cheese” (in this case, vegan parmesan – aka gold dust and my go-to mac ‘n’ cheese sauce) is a winner in my book.

This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and simplemethods. Plus, it comes together in just a little more than an hour.

The base is lightly sautéed cauliflower rice and steamed broccoli tossed in vegan parmesan cheese and my super velvety mac ‘n’ cheese sauce.
Then it’spoured into a baking dish, topped with more vegan parm, and baked! A short30-45 minutes later you have a bubbly, golden brown masterpiece on your hands.

I hope you love this recipe! It’s:

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch (or similar size) baking dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).Prepare your cauliflower rice (either with the shredding attachment on your food processor or a box grater). Set aside.Lightly steam your broccoli - just until it has a slight bite - either in the microwave in 45-second increments or on the stovetop using a steamer basket in a saucepan with 1-2 inch of water). Place in refrigerator for later.Next prepare your sauce. Heat a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and minced garlic. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until light golden brown, then add arrowroot starch and whisk - cook for 1 minute.Slowly add almond milk while whisking, then cook for 2 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently. The sauce will likely look a little clumpy - that’s OK! We’re going to blend it.Transfer mixture to a blender, along with 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), nutritional yeast, and vegan parmesan cheese and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed - you want it pretty well salted + cheesy, so don't be shy with the nutritional yeast, salt, and vegan parmesan cheese.Return sauce back to skillet from earlier and cook over low heat until warmed and slightly thickened - about 2-3 minutes - whisking occasionally. As it warms back up, it will thicken (see photo). For a thicker sauce, leave it as is. To thin slightly, add almond milk 1 Tbsp at a time until desired consistency is achieved. Turn off heat if it starts bubbling too aggressively or gets too thick.Heat a separate skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and cauliflower rice. Season with salt and pepper and stir to coat. Then cover and let cook/steam for 2 minutes. Remove cover, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes more or until slightly softened. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.Add the steamed broccoli to the mixing bowl and season liberally with salt, pepper and half of the vegan parmesan cheese (1/4 cup as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). This step is important to infuse plenty of flavor into the dish. Stir to coat. If adding chickpeas or kale, add at this time (optional).Add all of the sauce to the mixture and stir to coat.

315,Strawberry Coconut Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Coconut Granola

Do you have any embarrassingchildhoodcereal obsessions? My ultimate indulgence was Fruity Pebbles, then came Lucky Charms, and later, Frosted Mini Wheats. And when I was in college I developed a thing for Special K with Strawberries.
Are you sensing a pattern? I got progressively more old lady in my cereal tastes as I got older (appropriately so). And these days I don’t even buy cereal and only make my own – the ultimate grandmamove.
But be I honest, I miss strawberry cereal and was on a mission to recreate an inspired version at home. Spoiler alert: It’s ridiculously easy and crazydelicious.

This granola comes together in about 30 minutes and requires just 8 ingredients!
Rolled oats, nuts, and coconut form the base.
Coconut oil helps everythingcrisp up.
Maple syrup and coconut sugar add natural sweetness.
And the star of the show is freeze-dried strawberries!
Freeze dried fruit isextremely delicious when drowned in a bowl of milk. Ugh. Trust me, I did some testing and the results were conclusive.

I hope you all love this granola! It’s:
Light
Crunchy
Satisfying
Fruity
Naturally sweetened
Fiber- + protein-packed
Simple
&amp; Delicious
Make a batch of this granola to have on hand during the week for breakfast and on-the-go snacks. It’s tasty on its own, but it’s ideal when drowned in almond milk and topped with bananas. Yum.

","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C) .Add oats, nuts, coconut sugar, and salt to a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine.To a small saucepan, add coconut oil and maple syrup. Warm over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, whisking frequently until the two are totally combined and there is no visible separation.Immediately pour over the dry ingredients and stir to combine until all oats and nuts are thoroughly coated. Arrange on a bare large baking sheet and spread into an even layer (use more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size).Bake for 20 minutes. Then remove from oven, add coconut, and stir/toss the granola. Turn the pan around so the other end goes into the oven first (so it bakes evenly) and bake 5-8 minutes more. Watch carefully as to not burn, especially the coconut. You'll know it's done when the granola is deep golden brown and very fragrant.Let cool completely before adding the strawberries. Toss to combine. Enjoy as a plain snack, or top with bananas and dairy-free milk!Store leftovers in a sealed bag or container at room temperature for 2-3 weeks or in the freezer for up to 1 month or longer."
316,Smoky Tempeh Burrito Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky Tempeh Burrito Bowls

Tempeh and I have a rocky relationship. And by that I mean I keep trying to like it and I just don’t.
But (big but) things have changed recently! That’s good news, guys! I finally found a way to enjoy it to the point that I have to stop myself from eating too much of it (the true sign of a food you enjoy).

I’ve tried steaming tempeh before and I’ve tried mixing it into things, but I was never quite happy with the texture or flavor. Then I asked my pal Laurafor some tips and she revealed that her go-tomethodwas sautéing.
It was definitely on my list of things to try, but I’m so glad she suggested it. The key – as I’ve now learned – is to steam your tempeh for 10-15 minutes (in a steamer basket) and then sautée and season. And the seasoning, in this case, is a smoky, 5-ingredient red chipotle sauce.

It may notlook like much, but the taste and texture of the tempeh is spot on!
Plus, this recipe requires just 9 basic ingredients and comes together in the time it takes to prepare your burrito bowl fixings.

I hope you all LOVE these burrito bowls! They’re:
Saucy
Smoky
Super hearty
Flavorful
Protein-packed
&amp; Crazy delicious

","If serving with rice, start using this method from Saveur - my absolute favorite for fluffy (not sticky at all) brown rice! It takes 45 minutes, so start it now to be ready for serving.Next steam tempeh by adding 1 inch of water to a large saucepan and bringing to a simmer. Then insert steamer basket and top with tempeh (still whole or cut into large chunks). Cover and steam for 15 minutes - this will soften the texture slightly and most importantly, draw out some of the bitterness. Once steamed, cube and set aside.Make sauce by heating a medium cast iron or metal skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft and slightly browned - 3 minutes. Then add garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes more.Add tomato sauce, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce and stir. Heat until bubbly, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 3-4 minutes.Transfer sauce to a blender and blend on high for a completely smooth sauce. For a chunkier sauce, pulse and leave some texture (I prefer mine smooth). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding a pinch of salt for more flavor or adobo sauce for heat.Transfer sauce back to skillet and heat over low, stirring occasionally, to thicken the sauce and deepen the flavors.Next add black beans to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Once bubbling, reduce heat, add cumin and a pinch of sea salt, stir, and reduce heat to low/simmer (to keep warm until serving). For a refried bean texture, mash with the back of a wooden spoon until thick and paste-like (I left mine whole).Heat another large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and the cubed (steamed) tempeh and crisp and brown on all sides - about 6-8 minutes total. Then add to the red sauce and stir gently to coat.Cover with a lid for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld, then remove lid and continue simmering on very low temperature until serving.To serve, divide the rice, beans, tempeh, and vegetables of choice between 2-3 serving bowls. Garnish with lime and fresh cilantro (optional).Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days."
317,Easy Vegan Protein Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Vegan Protein Bars (4 Ingredients!)

Protein, protein, PROTEIN! (Said in loud, hulkyvoice.)
That’s whatI’ve jokingly been saying recentlyas I shovel mass amounts of food into my mouth.
I’ve been trying to add more protein intomy diet (as always), but it’s hard work! Namely because it’s challengingto remember that you need nutrients more than chocolate (even though chocolate is totally more fun).

I recently realized after a number of failed attempts at vegan protein bars that I shouldtotally just make my own.
So I did.
And they rocked.
And they’re easy.
And they’re way better than store bought (there I said it).
Plus, just 4 ingredients, naturally sweetened, and more than10 grams of protein per bar!
The base is peanut (or almond or sun) butter, then comes maple syrup and your favorite protein powder (I list mine below). And the final touch? POPPED AMARANTH.
Thismighty graincontainsplenty of nutrients and protein and has a neutral, slightly nutty flavor. Not to mention, it popsup beautifully on the stovetop in no time (10 seconds!).

I hope you love these bars! They’re:
Crunchy
Savory-(naturally) sweet
Insanely delicious
Peanut buttery
Protein-packed (10+ g/ bar!)
&amp; Highly portable!
These are the perfect snack to have around when you need a little extra protein during theday. They’re so simple once the amaranth is popped (you can do it, I believe in you). I highly recommend making a big batch and freezing these! They’ll stay forever in the freezer (OK, more like 1 month).
If you make this recipe let me know! Leave a comment, rate it, and tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper (or plastic wrap) and set aside (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).Pop* your amaranth by heating a large pot over medium-high heat. You'll know it's ready to start adding amaranth when a drop of water disperses quickly and balls up.Add about 2-3 Tbsp amaranth at a time and immediately cover. Shake the pot back and forth over the heat (wearing oven mitts is helpful) to move the grain around. It should start popping within 1-3 seconds, and be done popping at the 10-second mark. Be sure to pull them off at around 10 seconds or they'll start to burn.Not every single grain will pop (that's OK!). Very quickly empty into a mixing bowl. This may take a couple tries to dial in your heat and not burn them - it took me 4 tries! But then you'll hit your stride.Continue until you have roughly 1 1/2 cups popped grain (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). As you go, add your popped grain into a small mixing bowl first to ensure none are burnt. Then transfer to a larger bowl so you don't mix any burnt grain with perfectly popped grain. Set aside.Add peanut or almond butter and maple syrup to a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine. Then add protein powder and stir.Add popped amaranth a little at a time until you have a loose ""dough"" texture. Be careful not to add too much or the bars can lose their tackiness and won't stick together. I found roughly 1 1/4 cups to be about right (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Stir with a wooden spoon or use hands to disperse mixture evenly.Transfer the mixture to the baking dish and press down to form an even layer. Lay parchment paper or plastic wrap on top and use a flat-bottom object like a liquid measuring cup to press down and pack the mixture into an even, firmly packed layer.Transfer to freezer to set for 10-15 minutes or until firm to the touch. Then lift out and slice into 9 bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Enjoy as is, or drizzle with a bit of melted dark chocolate (optional).These get a little soft at room temperature, so store in the refrigerator (up to 5 days) or in the freezer (up to 1 month)."
318,Quinoa Chickpea Buddha Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Chickpea Buddha Bowl

This summer has beena glorious mix of amazing weather, trips to the farmers market, and travels to new cities. Sincesummer is on its way out (booo) I thought it appropriateto highlight one of my go-to meals recently: This 7-ingredient kale, quinoa, chickpea Buddha Bowl.
It may seem simpleand just like any other wholesome bowl, but the flavors meld together perfectly, it’s a nutrient powerhouse (with 22 g protein per serving), andits simplicity is the best part (anyone can make it)!
Interested in how this delicious bowl is made? Please follow me.

This recipe is inspired by the Mighty Bowl at Prasad (one of my favorite Portland restaurants) and starts with cooked-from-scratch chickpeas (which are totally easy by the way).
My new go-toquick soak method tenderizes the beans and opens them up nicely, saving you (6-8) hours of overnight soaking. Cook immediately after soaking and you have delicious, tender, nutrient-rich beans in roughly 2 hours flat.

In the final minutes of the beanscooking, it’s time to prepareyour quinoa (a gluten-free, protein powerhouse), make your 3-ingredient Tahini Sauce, and steam your kale (why kale is amazing, in case you aren’t convinced). Then it’s Buddha Bowl building time.

I hope you all LOVE this bowl! It’s:
Simple
Easy to make
Incredibly nutritious
Protein- + fiber-rich
Vegetable-packed
&amp; Crazy delicious

","Either soak chickpeas overnight in cool water (for 6-8 hours) or use the quick-soak method: Add rinsed chickpeas to a large pot and cover with 2 inches water. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil for 1 minute. Then turn off heat, cover, and let soak for 1 hour. Then drain, rinse, and add back to pot.To cook soaked chickpeas, add to a large pot and cover with 2 inches water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer, add salt and stir, and cook uncovered for 40 minutes - 1 hour 20 minutes (depending on the size/freshness of your beans).Sample a bean at the 40-minute mark to see how tender they are. You're looking for a just tender bean with a tiny bit of bite, and the skins will start to show signs of peeling (don't go too mushy!). Once cooked, drain beans and set aside and sprinkle with a bit more salt.In the last 30 minutes of the beans cooking, start your quinoa by heating a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and rinsed quinoa. Toast for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. This will allow some of the water to evaporate and add a nice toasty flavor.Add water and increase heat to medium-high/high to bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low (simmer), cover, and cook for 18-22 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and the water has completely absorbed. Then remove from heat and loosely drape the pot with a towel or paper towel to continue absorbing any excess moisture.Prepare dressing by adding tahini, sea salt and garlic powder to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Then add water a little at a time until it forms a pourable sauce.Lastly, steam kale. Add 1/2 inch water to a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Insert a steamer basket and the kale and cover. Steam for 1-2 minutes, or until kale is vibrant in color and slightly wilted. Immediately remove the kale from the heat and transfer to a small dish for serving.To serve, divide quinoa, chickpeas and kale between serving bowls and top with tahini sauce. Add a splash of fresh lemon juice for more flavor and a bit of acidity (highly recommended).Best when fresh, though leftover sauce, quinoa, and chickpeas can be stored separately in the refrigerator up to 4 days. Kale is best when (steamed) fresh."

Raise your hand if you’re always three years behind trends like me (wave it around, girl).
I’m still trying to figure out whether it’s cool or notto wearflare jeans. Please advise in the comments.
Veggie noodles have been a “thing” since like 2007, but I’m just now getting on board.
Who wants tospiralize things with me?!

Here’s the thing about spiralized noodles. It requires a tool, as in another thingto have lyingaround your kitchen and we tend to be anti “stuff.” We like to keep our kitchen minimal, as you might’ve guessed.(Get it, Minimalist Baker? Sensing a trend? You’re quick, I knew you’d get it.)
However, when your pal sends you her newcookbook and your very own spiralizer to try out, you kind of sort of have to use it. And since the rest of the free world seems to have one in their kitchen – including my mom, my sister, and probably all of my aunts – it’s about time I geton board.
The cool thing about spiralizing noodles – besides vegetables morphing into curly q’s – isthat there are options:
You can buy a countertop spiralizer,
Ahandheld spiralizer,
Or use a good old-fashioned vegetable peeler like I’ve done for the past several years.
And when in doubt, just use pasta. You simply can’t lose with pasta.

This recipe comes together in 30 minutes, you guys. That’s big! Just think: aflavorful, hearty, protein- and fiber-rich dinner on the table in half an hour.
Anyone can do it! Even you. Yes, you. You know I’m talking to you.
The marinarais hearty and rich, and includes carrots for texture and natural sweetness and lentils for plant-based protein (nearly 20 g protein per serving!). Serve over fresh or lightly sautéed zucchini noodles and you’re good to go.

Could there possibly be too many curries in the world? I say, no.
I’ve been super intored curries lately for their spicy, smoky kick. And because chickpeas lend so beautifully to spicy sauces, they are my protein of choice here.
Shall we dig in?

This curry is inspired by one I’ve been ordering from a local Thai shop in our new neighborhood. There’s nothing a little papaya salad, spring rolls, and curry won’t fix after a long day. It’s been our go-to Sunday routine as of late. (I’m not mad about it.)
This recipe is simple, requiring just 1 pot and 30 minutesto prepare!
Plus, the ingredients are simple and versatile. Don’t have eggplant? Omit or sub for mushrooms or zucchini. Don’t have bamboo shoots? Leave ’em out. Looking for more protein? Be sure to include the green peas, which provide 8 grams per cup!

321,20-minute Asian Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Salad,"20-minute Asian Kale Salad

I recently tried doing an elimination diet – emphasis on the “tried.”
I think I lasted about oneweek, but one foodI did manage to do was avoid soy. During that time, I discovereda way to do Asian food without tamari or soy sauce.
Exciting, right? Allow me to demonstrate.

A local grocery store in Portland has this amazing kale “slaw” with carrots and cabbage, and I’ve basically been living off of it for the past month.
It’s the easiest thingto reach into therefrigerator and grab to make quick salads, scrambles, or bowls. And I’ve made my own version for the base of this salad.
The amazing part of this 20-minute recipeis the dressing. It’s a simple mix of cashew butter, chili garlic sauce, maple syrup, and sesame oil (meaning it’s soy-free!). A sprinkle of salt (or tamari) adds a bit of saltiness if needed, but I usually skip! It’s a gorgeous bright orange hue, creamy, and spicy-sweet (my favorite).

This salad makes a delicious snack or side, but to make it an entrée, I added some miso-roasted crispychickpeas! That’s right, I did a little internet research and found a few tips for making chickpeas super crispy and crunchy.

Do you ever look at foods and wonder what else they could be?
I do it all the time. That’s how I comeup with recipes likeVegan “Pulled Pork” Sandwiches, Vegan Pepperoni, Eggplant Queso, and Quinoa Brittle. I think it’s limiting to think of foods as only being enjoyed one way.
Such is the case with watermelon. Think big, people. It isn’t just meant to be cubed and enjoyed at BBQs (although, absolutely delicious).
What if you turned it into “sashimi”?

Just looking at watermelon it has the same hue as tuna or salmon. Kind of weird, right? The texture may be different, but its color and flavor lend to a fun application of sashimi. This plant-based version is oh-so much fun.Plus, it onlyrequires7 ingredients and 10 minutes!
Simply slice watermelon into triangles, wick awaysome of the moisture, and brush with a sesame-tamari glaze. A little wasabi adds a kick, which I thoroughly enjoy with sushi.

Toppings can be modified to what sounds best to you, but to keep things simple I went with avocado, red onion and pickled ginger. A few sesame seeds (black or white) add a nice pop of color and tiny crunch.

I hope you all LOVE this sashimi! It’s:

In most situations, my 4-ingredient Garlic Dill sauce is where it’s at. It’s lemony, herby, and packed with tons of fresh garlic flavor. Recently, however, I’ve been reaching for something more subdued, especially when it comes to myfalafel addiction.
Enter: 3-Ingredient Tahini Sauce for Everything.

This sauce was inspired by Wolf + Bear in Portland (one of my favorite food carts!), which has me hooked on falafel salads with tahini dressing (and Tahini Bombs!). Upon investigating thetexture and flavor of theirsauce, I realized how simple it really was. Consider thismy inspired version.

This recipe couldn’t get any easier. Sprinkle a little salt and garlic powder on tahini and whisk. Then add water and whisk. THAT’S IT. It’s hardly a recipe but it’s too good and simple not to share.
What does one put this tahini sauce on? Everything:
Falafel (!!)
Veggie Burgers
Salads
Chickpea Fritters
Arrancini
Sandwiches

And,one more dish that’s coming at ya soon. Stay tuned! In the meantime, if you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!

","Add tahini, sea salt, and garlic powder to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine.Add water a little at a time, continuing to whisk, until you have a creamy, pourable sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Tahini is meant to be the prominent flavor, but add garlic powder for more garlic flavor or sea salt for saltiness.This sauce is ideal for falafel, salads, veggie burgers, and just about everything in between! It's ideal for dishes that need a creamy sauce that isn't overwhelmingly flavorful.Store in the refrigerator covered for 1-2 weeks."
327,No-Bake Almond Butter Cup Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Almond Butter Cup Bars

We recently made a trip back to Kansas to visit family and friends and during our stayI got to hang out with my pal, Laura, who is my kindred spirit who also eats gluten-free, is super into baking, and even crafted this fine Gluten Free Pizza Crust Recipe. Isn’t she a gem?
We were passing through a health food store, checking out their wares, when I spotted a Hail Merry almond butter tarton the top shelf. The tart and I locked eyes, and I immediately knew its destiny: my stomach. So I snatched one up andwepromptly devoured it.
This is my inspired version.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 basic ingredients and 20 minutes to make!
The chocolate date-nut crust is adapted from my No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecakes. The filling is justalmond butter mixed with a little sea salt and maple syrup. And the top layeris a simplified version of my 2-ingredient Dark Chocolate Truffles!
What’s not to love?


The reason I love these bars so much – besides the fact that they come togetherin 20 minutes – is the salty-sweet combo.
My favorite desserts have always struck a balance between salty and sweet (which explains my obsession with Snickers), and this recipe is no different.
Plus,they’re naturally sweetened (aside from the dark chocolate ganache), and chock-full of protein and fiber thanks to the nuts and almondbutter. Serious love for these gems.

I hope you LOVE these bars! They’re:
Decadent
Rich
Fudgy
Satisfying
Perfectly salty-sweet
Super chocolaty
Quick &amp; easy
&amp; Insanely delicious
These would make the perfect bars to have on hand during the week when you’re craving something sweet but not overly indulgent. They’re also great for entertaining, as they’re sure to please a crowd.
If you try this recipe, you have to let us know! We love your comments, ratings, and – as always – your photos tagged #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!

","Prepare crust by adding nuts, cocoa powder, and sea salt to a food processor and blending into a meal. Remove from bowl and set aside.Add dates to the food processor and mix/pulse until small bits remain or a ball forms. Break up the dates with a spoon so they're not all in one clump. Then add the nut-cocoa mixture back in and blend to combine until a loose dough is formed.Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined 8x8-inch baking dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size) and spread with fingers to evenly distribute. Then top with parchment paper or plastic wrap and use a flat-bottomed object - such as a drinking glass or measuring cup - to press and pack the crust into a solid, even layer. Remove parchment paper and set aside.Add almond butter to a small mixing bowl along with maple syrup and sea salt. Stir to combine. (Depending on the brand, if it is extremely runny you may need to add a little almond meal to thicken until spreadable, but I didn't find this necessary.)Add the almond butter mixture to the crust in spoonfuls. Then top with parchment paper again and use the same object from earlier to spread and pack the mixture down into a flat, uniform layer. Remove parchment paper and set in freezer to chill.Add finely chopped dark chocolate to a medium mixing bowl. Add coconut milk and coconut oil to a separate glass mixing bowl or glass measuring cup and microwave until hot but not boiling (alternatively, heat in a saucepan on the stovetop until very hot). Pour the coconut milk directly over the chocolate, stir to combine, and cover with something (such as plastic wrap) to encourage it to melt.Let set for 5 minutes. Then whisk to combine. The mixture should be entirely melted and smooth. If not, heat in the microwave in 20-30 second increments until entirely smooth and no chunks remain. (Alternatively, set your glass or ceramic mixing bowl over a double boiler on the stovetop to melt).Remove 8x8-inch pan from the freezer and pour the ganache on top. Spread with a spoon until smooth. Then add back to the freezer to set for 5-10 minutes, or until semi-firm to the touch (enough to slice).Slice into desired number of bars: 9-12 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) or even smaller so they're ""bites"" rather than ""bars."" Enjoy immediately. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month."
328,Berry Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Go-To Smoothie Bowl (5 minutes!)

Lately I’ve been a bit obsessed with smoothie bowls (or as I call them, smoodie bowls).
The concept is simple and I’ve done it before here and here! But I believe this is my best version yet, and the trick is all in the blending method.
Come see how!

This recipe only requires 3 ingredients, 1 blender,and 5 minutes. Huzzah!
Simply addfrozen bananas andfrozen mixed berries to a blender and blend on low (this is key!) until it looks like Dip ‘n’ Dots (remember those?!). Then add a little (not too much!) non-dairy milk of choice – I like coconut – and protein powder if you’d like.
Blend some more on low, scraping down the sides until you have SOFT SERVE! Yes, a smoothie bowl is glorified soft serve and it’s so dang delicious. Hence the reason I can’t stop.

The best part about smoothie bowls is the toppings. I’ve been keeping it super simple recently and adding a spoonfuleach coconut flake, hemp seeds,and chia seeds for added nutrients, fiber, and protein.
Fruit makes a pretty addition but isn’t necessary since the entire bowl is made of fruit.

This recipe is so simple, but I hope you give it a try and love it! It’s:
Creamy
Fruity
Naturally sweet
Nutrient-rich
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Quick!
This makesthe perfect breakfast or snack when you’re in a rush but need something substantial (and want something pretty). It’s especially great for the summer months when we’re all looking for another way to cool down and keep time in the kitchen to a minimum.
If you try this bowl, let us know what you think! Leave a comment, rate it, and tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see your smoothie bowls in action. Cheers, friends!

","Add frozen berries and banana to a blender and blend on low until small bits remain - see photo.Add a bit of coconut or almond milk and protein powder (optional), and blend on low again, scraping down sides as needed, until the mixture reaches a soft serve consistency (see photo).Scoop into 1-2 serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I prefer chia seeds, hemp seeds, and coconut, but strawberries, granola, and a nut or seed butter would be great here, too!Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the freezer for 1-2 weeks.

329,Sun-dried Tomato Chickpea Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sun-Dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers

Say hello to my new best friend. I mean, my new favorite veggie burger. (You can’t be friends with a veggie burger, right?)

Ever since I discovered the trick of quick-soaking chickpeasinstead of using canned chickpeas to make the perfect falafel, my mind is spinning with applications.
Don’t worry. This is the firstexperiment of many.
This 10-ingredient version uses chickpeas as a base and is infused with sun-dried tomatoes for a savory, sweet tomato flavor, which is balanced with fresh garlic and herbs (parsley or basil).

The beauty of this burger is that it doesn’t crumble when bitten into like mostveggie burgers. Friends, this is huge! Not only is it delicious and flavorful and full of plant-based protein, but it acts like a “true burger” in texture. Pinch me, I’m dreaming.
I hope you all LOVE this burger! It’s insanely flavorful, hearty, satisfying, grillable, and perfect for cookouts or easy weeknight meals.
If you give these a try, leave a comment, rate it, and tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we know how they turned out! Cheers, friends!

","Rinse (uncooked) chickpeas in a fine mesh strainer and add to a large pot. Cover with 2 inches water and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 1 minute. Then cover, remove from heat, and let set for 1 hour. Then drain and lightly rinse and dry thoroughly (method from the Kitchn).In the meantime, add parsley or basil, onion, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes to a food processor. Mix until well processed. Set aside.Once the chickpeas are slightly cooled, add half to the food processor, along with cumin, turmeric, salt, pepper and tahini. Mix to combine thoroughly, scraping down sides as needed. Then add the rest of the chickpeas and blend until you have a dough that's close to a paste in consistency. This may take up to 4-5 minutes to fully incorporate all of the spices and herbs. Add more tahini or a bit of water if the mixture is looking too crumbly or dry.Sample a small bit and adjust spices/salt/herbs as needed. Then cover and set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes - 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld and the texture to become more firm.Remove from refrigerator and divide into 4-6 even patties (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and gently form into patties using your hands. If the burgers aren't holding together the mixture may need to be blended more thoroughly, or blended with a bit more tahini.To cook, heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium/ medium-high heat (or cook on the grill!). Once hot, add enough oil to create a thin layer on the bottom of the pan and wait 1-2 minutes for the oil to heat up. Then place only as many burgers as will fit comfortably in the pan and cook 2-3 minutes on each side. Once the bottom side is evenly browned, flip gently, as they can be fragile. Continue until all burgers are cooked. Adjust heat as needed if they're browning too quickly, or aren't cooking quickly enough.These burgers are delicious on their own with garlic dill sauce or pesto and desired toppings. They're also great with a bun, but it isn't necessary! Alternatively, serve over greens, in pita, or enjoy as is!To freeze, lay uncooked burgers on a plate or baking sheet and freeze. Once firm, transfer to a freezer safe container and freeze up to one month. Let thaw before cooking on the stovetop or grill."
330,Vegan Pepperoni | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pepperoni

If you follow me on snapchat (@minimalistbaker), you know I’ve been trying to make vegan pepperoni for a while now. It’s been one of those recipes I dreamed up and then struggled to perfect. But, after many failedattempts, I’m happy to report I cracked the code!
Say goodbye to the days of vegetables-only pizza (not that there’s anything wrong with that). Vegan pepperoni to the rescue!

For the base, I experimented with tofu, tempeh, and chickpeas, tryingeach individuallyand mixed to find the right texture.
While tempeh seemed to yield the right texture initially, when baked it gets pretty dry and crumbly. The same goes for chickpeas. Tofu, however, lends itself perfectly to the texture of pepperoni because it bakes up beautifully and holds it shape! Plus, it’s neutral in flavor and does an excellent job at absorbingall of those pepperonispices.
In total, this recipe requires just 10 ingredients and comes together in less than 1 hour! Some versionsI tested required more than 1 full day to prepare, but I knew that wasn’t realistic. I think it’s pretty awesome that you canmake this pepperoni from scratch for dinner tonight! (Pats self on back).

What spices will you need? Excellent question!
A blend of sea salt, black pepper, red pepper flake, paprika, garlic powder, ground anise, fennel (this one’s important!), ground mustard, and coconut sugar for a little sweetness. Ididn’t have all of these spices onhand, but now that I have them, I can’t wait to experiment with other uses.

In addition to being relatively easy to make, these pepperoni are considerably healthier than their animal-based counterpart. They’re very low in fat – less than 1 gram fat per pepperoni – and relatively high in protein – about 1 gram protein per pepperoni! If you ate all the pepperonis (like I did), that would be 30 g protein. That’s a lot of plant-based fuel!

I hope you all try and love this recipe! It’s:
Spicy
Hearty
Smoky
Salty
Perfectly tender +crisp
&amp; Seriously delicious
This is the perfect topper for vegan and gluten-free pizzas, as well as deep dish, portobello, and butternut! I could also see these tucking beautifully inside of calzones! The options are endless. I just love that the texture is so close to the real thing, and they’re addictively salty and spicy.
If you give this recipe a try, let us know what you think! We love your comments, ratings, and especially your photos tagged #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see how yours turn out. Cheers, friends!

","Wrap tofu in a clean towel and set something heavy on top - like a cast-iron skillet - to press out liquid for 10-15 minutes. Also preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Once pressed, cube tofu and add to a food processor along with sea salt, black pepper, red pepper flake, ground mustard, fennel seeds, smoked paprika, garlic powder, coconut sugar, ground anise, and A1 sauce/liquid smoke (optional). Mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed.Sample and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, red pepper flake for heat, paprika for smokiness, or coconut sugar for sweetness.Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined baking sheet (or more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size). Lay a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper on top and use your hands to spread into a uniformly thin layer about 1/4th - 1/8th inch thick (see photo). The more even the layer is, the more evenly it will bake. Spritz with a little nonstick spray or gently brush with a bit of oil to help it crisp up.Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, or until golden brown and slightly dried out. Then use a small or medium circular cookie cutter to cut out “pepperonis” (see photo). Feel free to keep the scrap pieces as well! They're just not as pretty.At this point, the pepperonis are ready to add to a pizza, where they should bake at least another 10-15 minutes. Time accordingly based on how long your crust takes to bake. You'll know they're ready when they're deep red in color and slightly crisp to the touch.If you don't want to add them to a pizza right away, simply let them cool, cover, and refrigerate (up to 4 days) or freeze (up to 1 month) for later use. If frozen, let thaw slightly before adding to the pizza to bake."
331,Best Vegan Pulled Pork Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich!

Yep, this is happening. My latest take on vegan pulled pork that just may be my bestyet.
Let’s BBQ!

My first attempt at vegan pulled pork was successful after jumping on the jackfruit train. I loved it so much that I created a spicier version topped with grilled pineapple forour cookbook! Serious swoon.
While I love using jackfruit as a vegan meat substitute, it has little to no protein. So after making my Vegan Sloppy Joes with lentils I was inspired to try a BBQ flavor. As you might’ve guessed, experimentationwent well. This may be my favorite lentil recipe yet!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients, and it comes together in less than 45 minutes! You likely have everything you need on hand besides BBQ sauce and buns (unless you’re like me and hoard these things in your pantry).
To infuse the lentils and shredded carrots – which add that amazing, stringy texture – with flavor, I relied on smoked paprika, coconut sugar, garlic powder, and sea salt. A little BBQ sauce sealed the deal forthat quintessential smoky BBQ flavor.


I hope you guys LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Hearty
Satisfying
Smoky
BBQ-infused
Packed with protein + fiber
Easy
&amp; So delicious
Even better news? One of four sandwichesboasts 17 grams of protein, making this the perfect plant-based version that will truly satisfy those hearty pulled pork cravings. While this is delicious on its own, it would pair perfectly with my Perfect Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli, Garlicky Chickpea Kale Salad, and Ginger Beer Margaritas!

","To a small saucepan, add water and rinsed lentils and heat over medium-high heat. Bring to a low boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for about 18 minutes, or until tender. The water should have a constant simmer (not boil). Drain off any excess liquid and set aside.When the lentils are almost finished cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and onion and season with a pinch each salt and pepper (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Stir to combine, and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the onions are tender and slightly browned.Next add cooked lentils, carrots, coconut sugar, paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper and BBQ sauce (see photo). Stir to combine.Continue cooking the mixture over medium-low heat until completely warmed through and thick, stirring occasionally - about 5-10 minutes.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more paprika for smokiness, salt for saltiness, coconut sugar for sweetness, or BBQ sauce for depth of flavor.Optional: Scoop half of the mixture into a food processor and (using the ""s"" shaped blade) mix/pulse to mash some of the lentils and carrots together. This creates a more cohesive texture, which I prefer.Serve the mixture on toasted buns of choice with toppings of choice. I went with shredded red cabbage, carrots, and sliced green onions. Serve with extra BBQ sauce for more flavor.Best when fresh, though lentil mixture will keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop until warmed through, adding water if the mixture has dried out."

This recipe is simple, requiring 5 minutes, 1 blender,and 9ingredients (that I now have on hand at all times – it’s serious).
I used to prefer my green smoothies on thesweeter side, but this one has me craving all the ginger and lime juice. It’s the the perfect balance of tart and sweet, healthy thanks to tons of greens, fruit, and coconut milk, and is aflavor combination I’ll never tire of.

I hope you all LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Cool
Perfectly tart-sweet
Loaded with greens
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Delicious
This is our go-to smoothie in the morning if I’m not making a smoothie bowl. It’s perfect as is, but it can alsobe adapted to includevegan protein powder (although I still haven’t found one I like that doesn’t upset my stomach – oy).

333,Tahini Stuffed Dates | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tahini-Stuffed Dates (aka Tahini Bombs!)

Whoa. That’s all I have to say about these babes.
The inspiration for these Tahini-Stuffed Dates came from two places:
1)A local restaurant
2) My 5-ingredient Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Snowballs from the March Bonus Recipe (viewed only by email subscribers!)
Get your taste buds ready. We’re going for a ride.

Inspiration struck after trying Wolf &amp;Bear’s “bunny balls,” which areessentially a date truffle with tahini and cacao powder.
Because the flavors weren’t as pronounced as I’d like, I decidedto deconstruct them. I kept the dates whole, stuffed each one with as much tahini as possible (almost 1 teaspoon each!), and then dunked them in myEasy Vegan Chocolate, which is naturally sweetened to taste and absolutely perfect for these tahini bombs.
I just like saying tahini bombs. Can you tell?

If you’re intimidated by makingchocolate, don’tbe. If I can do it, you can do it.
It does require cocoa butter, which is super easy to work with and also featured in my White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecakes, Easy Vegan Chocolate, and Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons. What I’m saying is: Invest in a block and it won’t go to waste around here (wink wink).
Not to worry if you can’t procurecocoa butter though – I include a workaround in the notes.


These dates require just 8 ingredients and about 30 minutes to make. They’re ready to enjoy right away, or can be frozen or refrigerated to keep fresh up to 1 month. In other words, a little effort for a lot of reward.

I think you guys are going to FLIP over these tahini dates! They’re:
Rich
Tender
Decadent (yet healthy)
Naturally sweetened
Loaded with tahini
Super chocolaty
Caramel-y
&amp; My new favorite thing
These would make the perfect dessert for summer get-togethers, dinner parties, or hosting events. They also make fun gifts! Edible gifts are the best gifts in my opinion.

","Add 2 inches of water to a medium saucepan and bring to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat. Then reduce heat to medium and set a medium glass or ceramic mixing bowl on top, making sure it's not touching the water (this creates a ""double boiler"").To the mixing bowl, add finely chopped cocoa butter and coconut oil and let melt, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon or whisk - about 2-3 minutes.Once melted, carefully remove bowl from heat (turn off stove top) and add the maple syrup and cacao or cocoa powder. Use a whisk or wooden spoon to mix until fluid and thoroughly combined.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added about 2 Tablespoons maple syrup total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), but it’s completely up to how sweet you prefer your chocolate.Because the chocolate is quite thin at this point, set in the refrigerator to chill and slightly thicken and make dipping the dates easier - about 15-20 minutes total, removing to stir/whisk occasionally. You'll know it's ready when it's more like pourable hot fudge than melted coconut oil.Next, carefully remove pits from dates and be careful to keep one side of the date intact, as opposed to splitting it into two separate pieces. You're trying to create a small crevice in the date (see photo) so it's easy to add/contain the tahini. Once pitted, fill with tahini - about 1/2 - 1 tsp depending on size of date.Add dates to a parchment-lined baking sheet and pop in freezer to chill while chocolate thickens.Once chocolate has thickened (if it got too thick, briefly microwave or set back over the double boiler to thin), add one date at a time and flip with a slotted spoon or fork to fully coat, then tap off any excess chocolate. Set back on the parchment baking sheet and immediately sprinkle with a little sea salt and either sesame seeds or coconut. Repeat until all dates are coated.Enjoy immediately. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for 1 week or the freezer for 1 month. Let come to room temperature before enjoying for best flavor/texture."
334,Classic Vegan Falafel (Gluten-Free) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Classic Vegan Falafel (GF)

How many falafel recipes can one person have on their blog?
Five. The answer is five. Proof:1–2–3–4.
Either I’ve lost my mind or I’m getting really good at making falafel. Fingers crossed it’s the latter.

We’ve been exploringour new Portlandneighborhood for about a month now, and we’re getting to know our favorite food spots (very important on ourlist of priorities).
One place I’m loving is Wolf and Bear, which serves up vegetarian and vegan Middle Easternfood with lots of gluten-free options. My go-to has been the gomasio salad with falafel. You can add two but I ask for three, because obviously.
Now that I’ve had this falafel a few times, I’ve studied its flavors and texture and was convincedit was time to up my falafel game. I think you know where this is going.

This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and isexpedited with the help of a quick-soak chickpea method I borrowed from The Kitchn.
The primary differences between this recipe and my previous attempts are that I start with dry chickpeas, and instead of baking, they’repan-fried – two improvements I believe make all the difference.

The ingredients are so simple, andthe flavors are complex and wonderful.
Soaked chickpeas are blended with onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, cardamom, coriander, and sea salt. A little oat flour keeps these gluten free while also helping them bind/form into a dough.After letting the mixturechill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, simply form into balls or discs and pan fry.Look at the crispy, golden perfection. Swoon! Find my selection of go-to sauces in the instructions.

335,Roasted Broccoli Sweet Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Broccoli Sweet Potato Chickpea Salad

We’re kind of boring. We eatMediterranean once or twicea week, usually in the form of a mishmash of spreads, vegetables, and chickpeas wrapped up inall the pita you can possibly stuff in your belly. Hello, stretchy pants.
One evening, I made the Roasted Chickpea Tabouleh Salad from our cookbookbut added some fresh red pepper, roasted broccoli, and sweet potato. I love making old things new again.

The other amazing thing about this recipe? You can pick up 90% of the ingredients at the farmers market.
Grab a beautiful head of broccoli, a sweet potato or two, some fresh dill and garlic, and a bell pepper and you’re pretty much set. All that’s left are chickpeas,hummus, lemon, and spices.
I love 30-minute meals that also happen tohave extremely basic, approachable ingredients.



The dressing, which has become a classic on the blog and in our home, is my go-to 4-ingredient Garlic Dill Sauce.
It’s madewith hummus, garlic, lemon juice, and dill – ingredients youlikelyalways have on hand, which makesit so easy to make up a batch and put it on everything throughout the week, from Chickpea Shawarma Dip to Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes to this salad.

I hope you all love this salad. It’s:
Simple
Fresh
Vegetable-packed
Protein- +fiber-rich
Super healthy
Satisfying

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line two (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if increasing batch size) baking sheets with parchment paper (or grease lightly).Add rinsed dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and season with oil, tandoori spice*, coconut sugar and salt. Toss to combine.Add sweet potatoes and chickpeas to one sheet, and the broccoli to another. Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper - toss to combine. Sprinkle with dill (optional). Then arrange in a single layer.Bake both for a total of 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans once near the halfway point. You can flip the sweet potatoes over to encourage even baking, but it's not necessary. You'll know the broccoli is done when it's golden brown, the sweet potatoes will be tender, and the chickpeas will begin firming up and taking on a slight crunch. Set aside.While vegetables and chickpeas are baking, prepare dressing by adding hummus, garlic, dill, and lemon juice to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Then add only enough water to thin until pourable. Set aside.To serve, divide vegetables and chickpeas between two serving plates and drizzle with dressing, or serve on the side.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep stored separately for 2-3 days in the refrigerator.

336,Vegan Milky Way | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Milky Way

There was a point in time whenmy love for Milky Waysurpassedmy love for Snickers. I know – it was a major shock to me, too.
Somehow, I managed to find room in my heart for one more candy bar. I guess, if I were to admitmy one fault, it’s that I love too much…(candy).

This recipe has been bouncing around in my head for a while now – the challenging part being the nougat.
I already knewhow to whip up a mean date caramel (pats shoulder) and melt chocolate (pats other shoulder), but the perfect nougat had eluded me…until now.
This 6-ingredient, 30-minute recipestarts with a date-based nougat that’s so easy I don’t know how I didn’t think of it before.
Can you find it in your candy-loving heart to forgive me? Please say yes, please say yes.

Dates are blended into a sticky ball, and then coconut flour and almond flour transform it into a perfect, moldable dough that takes on the flavor and characteristics of a (terrible-for-you, corn-syrup-laden) nougat. That’s what I call 4-ingredient magic.
Next comes date caramel. And lastly, melted chocolate with a dash of coconut oil to ensure it’s the perfect consistency for dipping.
We’re getting close. Can you feel it?

I know you guys are going to LOVE these bars! They’re:
Tender
Chocolaty
Caramel-stuffed
Triple-layered
Super rich
Easy to make
&amp; Healthified candy at its finest
These are the perfect treat to make when yourmost intense junk food craving strikes and you need a healthier fix, quick! They come together in about 30 minutes and last for up to 1 month in the freezer! Enjoy them one bar at a time or, if you’re like me, remove a bar from the freezer 5 times throughoutthe day and cut off small bites to make you “feel better” until the whole bar is gone (insert sneaky eyes emoji).

","Make nougat by adding dates to a food processor and blending until small bits remain or it forms a ball. Then add almond and coconut flour and sea salt. Mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed. You're looking for a semi-firm dough that isn't sticky. If too sticky, add in 1 Tbsp each almond flour and coconut flour at a time until you reach the right consistency.Once your dough is formed, add to a parchment-lined standard loaf pan (or more pans, as needed, if increasing batch size) and press down to form a uniform layer. Use something flat - such as a liquid measuring cup or glass - to help flatten. Then lift out of loaf pan and use your hands to shape any areas that are lumpy and compress it slightly until you have a rectangular nougat that is roughly 1/2-inch thick.Slice nougat into 6 even bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and set on a parchment-lined plate or baking sheet and pop in freezer to set.To make date caramel add dates to a food processor or high speed blender and mix until small bits remain or it forms a ball. Then begin adding warm water 1 Tbsp at a time while blending, scraping down sides as needed. You're looking for a spreadable consistency that isn't watery, but also isn't dough-like. Add salt and mix once more. Set aside.Remove nougat from freezer and spread with a generous amount (~2 Tbsp) of date caramel (see photo). You will likely have leftover date caramel*, which you can store in the refrigerator to use for things like ice cream, oatmeal, or other candy bars!Set nougat back in freezer while you prepare chocolate. To melt chocolate and coconut oil, either heat in the microwave in 30-second increments until creamy and smooth, or over a double boiler on the stove top. Transfer to a shallow dish and set aside.Remove nougat from freezer and quickly add one at a time to the melted chocolate. Use a fork to gently flip/roll the bar until completely coated. Then pick it up (nougat side down - caramel side up) and tap off any excess chocolate. Set back on parchment and repeat until all bars are dipped.Either let set at room temperature, or pop in the refrigerator or freezer for 5-10 minutes until the chocolate is firm.Enjoy at room temperature, or straight from the freezer or refrigerator. Will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks, or in the freezer up to 1 month (sometimes longer)."
337,Asian Quinoa Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Asian Quinoa Salad (30 minutes!)

Transition. It’s exciting. It’sscary. It’s a challenge.
We moved into our first home a few weeks backand are starting to feel a little settled. Just this week, we finally have a couch to sit on (little victories!).
The move was fairly painless, but I always findthat figuring out how you fit in a new space is the challengingpart. We have a kitchen that fits morethan one person, new windows that invitedifferentlighting,new angles to work around. I’m feeling more at home one day and one recipe at a time.
This was the first blog recipe in our new space, and I wanted to document it so I’d remember what was going on in my head and in our kitchen during thisnew season of life.

Do you ever see an image thatinspires you to act in some way? This is how the inspiration struckfor this 30-minute Asian-inspired salad.
I don’t remember where but in passing I saw a photo of an Asian-looking salad with quinoa and some savory-sweet looking dressing. YUM, must act. Must have.The rest is history.

The base of this beautiful, crunchy, satisfying salad is protein-rich quinoa, which cooks up in about 25 minutes while the rest of the magic happens.
Steam broccoli and edamame.
Shred cabbage.
Chop red pepper.
Make dressing.
Toss.
Eat.
Yum.
So much goodness in so little time.

I hope you all love this salad. It’s:
Savory
Spicy
Sweet
Crunchy
Flavorful
Healthy
&amp; SO easy to make
This is the perfect salad when you’re craving something satisfying, delicious, and veggie-packed. Half of the recipe boasts 24 grams of protein and 14 grams of fiber! And although it’s delicious enjoyed fresh, something magical happens when it’s chilled and enjoyed the next day for lunch. Leftover game on point!

338,Vegan Nicoise Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Nicoise Salad (30 minutes!)

I’m 12 days away from turning 30.
I despise public speaking, but sometimes,I do it anyway.
Summer is my favorite.
My hair is short, but I wish it werelong.
Life is still good.
My husband is the best.
I wake up every morning in our new house pinching myself over how beautiful it is.
I miss my mom and my dad.
Watermelon is my favorite.
Farmers markets are life.
This salad? Also life. Shall we?

You guys know that turning dishesplant-based is my jam, so this salad has beena long time coming.
This salad was inspired by oneI had a while backwhen we were in France. We’d stopped at a cafe in Nimes and I ordereda Nicoise salad that was quite possibly the best I’d ever had – and probably ever will have – in my life. Nicoise salads are named for theNicoise olives that adorn them, which can be found at most grocery stores (check the olive bar). Truth be told, any quality olive will do – especially green and kalamata.

Simple perks? You betcha. Just 30 minutes required with a little fancy pants multi-tasking.
Blanch green beans while boiling potatoes. Mash chickpeas then make dressing. A little of this, a little of that.
Before you know it, you have a delicious plant-based powerhouse on your hands with more than 16 grams of protein and fiber eachper serving. That’s a lot of plant power.

I hope you guys love this salad. It’s my new favorite. It’s:
Hearty
Fresh
A mix of flavors and textures
Savory
Easy to make
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect lunchtime salad or one to enjoy as dinner when you’re craving something on the lighter side that still satisfies.

Then add green beans or haricot verts and boil for 2-4 minutes, or until bright green in color and only slightly tender - they should still have slight crunch when bitten. While they're cooking, fill a large mixing bowl with ice water. Once the green beans are done cooking, drain thoroughly and immediately add to the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and pat dry - set aside.Add drained, rinsed chickpeas to a small mixing bowl, along with sea salt, mustard, maple syrup, dill, and sunflower seeds. Stir to combine and mash a few chickpeas to create texture. Set aside.Add dressing ingredients to a mason jar (or whisk in a small mixing bowl) and shake vigorously to combine. Set aside.To serve, divide lettuce between two large serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) or plates and top with chickpeas, green beans, potatoes, olives, tomato and beets (optional).

339,Carrot Orange Juice | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super-Powered Orange Juice

While on vacation recently I read a book I enjoyedso much, I read it twice. That’s saying a lot for a girl who used to despise reading.
The book iscalled Modern Rapunzelby Jeanne Powers. The cover looks a little bizarre andout of touch, but don’t let that fool you. Itboasts a ton of information about women’s health and natural beauty, especially for hair and skin (my top two concerns when it comes to aging gracefully – fingers crossed as 30 approaches).

In the book, Jeanne sharesabout atime when she gotvery sick and suffered from hair lossas a result, and she nursed herself back to healthwithnatural remedies, includingcarrot juice. This is my kind of lady.
Carrots are loaded withbeta carotene which doeswonders forthe body and fights off disease-causing free radicals. They’realso extremely high in Vitamins A, B, C, E and K, magnesium, potassium and calcium, and havebeen found to fight inflammation, relieve congestion, andprotect eyesight and brain function among many other benefits. All of these vitamins and minerals boast a tonof benefits for yourskin and hair.
Naturally, they’re my new best friend.

I’m not typically a big juice fan because I prefer smoothies and the fiber they provide. But, for carrots, I make exceptions.
While I was reading this book, we were on vacation in Healdsburg, California, home to a beautiful restaurant calledShed. Their coffee shop offered two fresh daily juices: one green and one orange. The orange boasted carrots. I was in.
I enjoyedan orange juice almost every day we were there, and I’ve since been making my own inspired version at home. Get ready for some good, healthy fun, kids.

This 6-ingredient, 10-minute (juicer-free!) juice is based with carrots and naturally sweetened with orange, nectarine, and apple. Lemon juice adds brightness, and ginger some zing (and anti-inflammatory perks, yo). Mint is optional for an earthy, minty vibe. Do it – you know you want to.
I hope you guys love this beauty elixir. It’s extremely simple, easy to make, loaded with vitamins and minerals, super delicious, and my new go-to morning beverage.

","If using a juicer, add all ingredients to the juicer and press (omit water). Otherwise, squeeze orange and lemon juice into a blender as the pulp can make the juicing process more difficult.Next add nectarine, apple, ginger, carrots, and mint (optional). Top with filtered water (start with the lesser quantity), cover and blend until combined. You don't want your blender to get the juice too hot in temperature so be careful not to over-blend - it shouldn't take more than 30 seconds.Drape a clean, thin towel over a large mixing bowl and carefully pour over the juice and pulp. Then gather the corners and begin extracting the juice, leaving the pulp behind. Continue squeezing until all juice is extracted. You can either compost the pulp or add it to baked goods!Enjoy the juice fresh. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for 2-3 days, though best in the first 12-24 hours for mineral and vitamin content."
340,Sunflower Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Seedy Sunflower Butter

Sunflower butter.
God’s gift to those who cannot have nuts (moment of silence for this delicious treattheincredible hand is modeling).

Although I can have nuts, I have a tendency to overdo it on almond butter (raise hands if you go through 1 jar a week).
Recently, I’ve been enjoying cashew butter and sunflower butter. However, I’ve noticed that many of the sunflower butter brands include added sugar and it ends up being too sweet for my taste. So I wanted to make my own version that I felt better about enjoying every day.

This 6-ingredient, 20-minute sunflower butter gets a serious nutritional boost fromhemp seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds and chia seeds! Theynot only add essential amino acids, protein, fiber, healthy fats, and more, but also a nutty crunch to this creamy spread.
Speaking of spread, what do you spread this butter on? I’m so glad you asked
Banana Bread
Coconut Yogurt Waffles
Gluten-Free Waffles
Vegan Whole-Grain Pancakes
Vegan French Toast
Vegan Pumpkin Bread
Steel-Cut Oats
Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Muffins (in place of PB)
Overnight Oats(in place of PB)

","If your sunflower seeds are roasted (select unsalted if possible), skip this step. Otherwise, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and spread sunflower seeds on a baking sheet.Roast for 10-15 minutes, stirring/turning the pan occasionally, until fragrant and light golden brown.Add roasted sunflower seeds to a food processor (or high speed blender) and blend until a butter forms, scraping down sides as needed. It should take about 5-7 minutes. Resist the urge to add any additional oil (and especially not water, as it will cause the butter to seize up).Add salt, chia seeds, flax seed, hemp seed, and pumpkin seeds and mix/pulse to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt, or a bit of sweetener of choice if desired (avoid using liquid sweeteners, as they can cause the butter to seize up and lose its form).This spread is perfect for toast, baked goods, waffles, pancakes and more! Store at room temperature for 1-2 weeks, or in the refrigerator up to 1 month!"
341,Cauliflower Rice Burrito Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Rice Burrito Bowl

It’s no secretI have a thing for Mexican food. We eat it in some form at least twice a week, and I have countless recipes on the blog for tacos, beans, salads, enchiladas, and nachos on the blog. You’re smart – you can see a pattern.
Another favorite? The burrito bowl. It’s the first thing I cravewhen we come home from a long trip. It’s fast, easy, healthy, delicious.
Ihave my classic take on the 30-minute burrito bowl in our print cookbook (!!). And after trying my hand at Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers (!!) recently, I knew a faster, inspired version of the same meal was in order. I think you know what happened next. (Hint: this deliciousness.)

The base is cauliflower rice, which gets steamed slightly on the stovetop and then packedwith flavor thanks tosalsa, cilantro, lime juice, and spices. I could eat that for lunch on its own, but wait, there’s more.

Guacamole is optional, but the black beans and sautéed peppers and onions are not.
This pairing adds plenty of plant-based protein and fiber, vitamins and minerals, and not to mentiontons of flavor. Yes, please.

I hope you guys love this 30-minute, vegan, GF dinner! It’s:
Fast
Easy
Flavorful
Veggie-packed
Protein- and fiber-rich
Super healthy
Crowd-pleasing
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect meal when you want something substantial but healthy on the table fast (story of my life).

342,Lime Pie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Lime Pie Bars

These creamy lime pie bars are inspired by my Creamy Lemon Bars, which have become a fan favorite since I shared them in February.
I made a few slight adjustments, but they’re still just as simple and delicious as the original, only playing on the tart flavor of limes.

The base is my favorite nut-oat crust that ends up tasting like a nutty graham cracker – I know, it’s magic.
And the filling is a blend of soaked cashews, coconut cream, lime juice and zest, arrowroot for thickening, and maple syrup for sweetness.
All in all, this recipe requires just 10 simple ingredients.

The filling bakes into a custard-like texture that’s so temptingly delicious you’ll want to scoop right in. But, wait for them to chill before slicingfor the best results.
I hope you all love these Lime Pie Bars! They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Summery
Citrusy
Naturally sweet
&amp; Absolutely satisfying
Make these bars for entertaining or to have on hand throughout the week as a healthier dessert. Unlike my raw cheesecakes, which need to stay in the refrigerator to keep their shape, these can sit out at room temperature for hours and remain perfectlyintact anddelicious, making them idealfor dinner parties, cookouts, and picnics.

If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil.Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking sheet and spread evenly. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed. A little may go up the sides, which is good!Bake for 12 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly.

This recipe is a reader request (yay!!).
Plus,it’s actually one I’ve been meaning to take a swing at for a while now because fig newtons are kind of my jam.
I remember being able to get away with eating fig newtons as a kid because they were a “healthier” cookie. Well, at least healthierthan my soft batch chocolate chip cookie addiction.
Oy. Healthier options, for the win.

These cookies are easy to make, requiring just 8ingredients! Plus, they’re naturally sweetened and no-bake (with the exception of toasting your oats and nuts before blending).
The filling is a simple blend of dried figs, cinnamon, dates, and orange zest. And the outer cookie is made of almonds, pecans, oats, and dates.

The result is a perfectly tender, sweet, fig-stuffed cookie that is greatfor snacking, refueling, or when you need a healthier dessert.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and arrange oats and nuts on a baking sheet. Bake for 8-12 minutes, rotating the pan near the the halfway mark to ensure even cooking, until golden brown and fragrant. Set aside.Once slightly cooled, add oats, nuts, and sea salt to a food processor and process into a fine meal with salt. Remove from processor and set aside.Add pitted dates to food processor and mix/pulse until small bits remain or it forms a ball. Scoop out and set aside.Add nuts and oats back to food processor and spoon in the mixed dates. Mix/pulse until a loose dough is formed when squeezed between two fingers.Spread the “dough” onto a clean parchment-lined surface and top flatten down with hands. Then top with another piece of parchment paper and use a rolling pin to flatten into a 1/4-inch thick sheet. Remove top sheet of parchment paper and use hands to form into a rectangle. Then halve with a knife so there are two equal strips.Add figs (stems removed) to a mixing bowl and cover with hot (not boiling) water. Soak for 3 minutes, then drain but reserve fig water for later (to thin filling).Add figs to food processor and blend into a ball (see photo), then add orange zest, ground cinnamon, salt and mix. Add reserved date water a little at a time until it starts to form a paste, but be careful not to add too much - you want it to be thick but spreadable.Next add as many dates and/or coconut sugar as desired to sweeten and blend to combine. I used 10 dates and 1 1/2 Tbsp coconut sugar (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). However, you could also leave it as is.Spread the fig paste (or transfer spread into a plastic or piping bag and “pipe”) into 1-inch-thick lines down the center of your two date-nut strips. Be careful not to add too much filling that your cookie dough can’t fold over. You may have leftover filling (which can be reserved to add to baked goods, oatmeal, or future cookies).Next use the parchment paper to gently roll the edges of the dough over the fig filling until your two dough ends meet. The dough may crack a little, but because it’s moist it will reform as you continue rolling/forming. Like sushi, use the parchment paper to tighten and gently form the seams of the dough together.For ease of transfer, cut both of the cookie logs in half and use a spatula or pie server to gently transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze for at least 30 minutes (up to 1 hour or overnight) to set/firm up. Then use a sharp knife to slice into roughly 1-inch slices. There should be about 22-24 cookies (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Enjoy immediately. Store in the refrigerator in a well-sealed container up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month! They’re delicious and tender right out of the fridge."
344,Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers

Oh the wonders of cauliflower rice.
Perfect in stir fries, arancini, curries… The options are endless.
It was only a matter of time before I stuffed it inside peppers and called it dinner. (And spoiler alert: It’s oh-so delicious.)

This recipe was inspired by my classic Quinoa Stuffed Peppers. I made them for dinner one recent evening, and several bites in, I speculated as to whether a grain-free version would be doable. To the drawing board I went.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 basicingredients and easy methods that yieldbig, flavorful results.
A head of cauliflower is shredded into ‘rice’ and sautéed lightly with green onion (garlic is optional). Then add beans, salsa, lime juice, and plenty of smoky spices to create a savory filling that’s perfect when stuffed into sweet bell peppers. (I’m getting hungry all over again.)

Another perk of this recipe? It could easily be made ahead of time. Simply prepare up untilthe point of baking, refrigerate, and then bake when you need it.
Even if you don’t have time to prep beforehand, the whole thing comes together in about 1 hourwith just 15minutes of hands-on prep time. That gives you plenty of time to whip upa margarita (or two), prepare my Creamy Cilantro Sauce (if you dare)for serving,and read a book (or whatever brings a thrill to your evening).
See? Dinner can bethat easy.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Simple
Savory
Healthy
Vegetable- + fiber-packed
Rich in protein (nearly 10 g protein per serving!)
Entirely plant-based + gluten-free
&amp; So delicious
Stuffed peppers are great for servinga mixed crowd because they’re so filling and flavorful that no one will miss the meat.

It’s so versatile and reminds me so much of graham crackers without all the extraingredients or sugar. More creations to come with this beauty – stay tuned.

Once the pie has set, simply top with more coconut whip and toasted coconut and you’re good to go! I hope you all LOVE this pie. It’s:
Creamy
Cold
Super coconutty
Perfectly sweet
Fluffy, cloud-like
Nestled into a graham cracker-like crust
&amp; Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect pie to have on hand for entertaining guests or to take along to gatheringsand BBQs. Who doesn’t like coconut cream pie (seriously)? Plus, this version is vegan and gluten-free so everyone can enjoy.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and either line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper, or grease a standard pie dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size). Set aside.Add oats, almonds, sea salt (optional), and coconut sugar to a high-speed blender and mix/pulse on high until a fine meal is achieved.Remove lid and add melted coconut oil, starting with 5 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and adding more if it's too dry. Pulse/mix on low until a loose dough is formed, scraping down sides as needed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil.Transfer mixture to prepared pie pan or baking dish and spread evenly to distribute. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed on the bottom and up the sides. If using a pie pan, use your fingers to press it evenly as possible up the sides of the dish.Bake for 17-22 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.In the meantime, prepare pudding by adding cornstarch, coconut sugar, and salt (optional) to a small saucepan and whisk in coconut milk to avoid clumps.Place over medium heat and cook until bubbling, whisking frequently. Then reduce heat to low and continue cooking for 4-6 more minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom almost constantly.Once it appears ""jiggly"" and a visible ribbon forms when you drizzle some over the top with your spatula, remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and coconut flakes (optional - will add a 'crunchier' texture) and transfer to a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic wrap is touching the surface or it will form a film. Refrigerate until cooled and set - about 2-3 hours.In the meantime, place a medium-large glass mixing bowl in the freezer for your coconut whipped cream. Remove coconut cream cans from fridge, being careful not to shake or turn them and remove top.Gently scoop out the top hardened ""cream"" into the chilled bowl, leaving any liquid watery portion behind. You can use this for smoothies or in baking, if you wish. Otherwise discard it.Use a handheld mixer to whip the coconut cream until it begins to look like whipped cream - about 1 minute. Then add desired amount of organic powdered sugar. Beat again until light and airy - about 2-3 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. Set in refrigerator (covered) to chill.Once the pudding is completely cooled, is jiggly and set, add half of the coconut whipped cream and stir lightly until just combined. Set in refrigerator.Add custard-coconut whip mixture to the baked crust and smooth the top with a spoon, then cover with plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to chill/set.To serve, top with remaining coconut whipped cream and toasted coconut flake, slice, and enjoy! Store leftovers gently covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days, though best within the first 48 hours."
346,Zucchini & Grilled Corn Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grilled Corn &amp; Zucchini Salad with Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette

Last week I showed you my favorite method for grilling corn.
This week? Let’s throw in some zucchini and a tangy sun-dried tomato dressing and call it a salad, shall we?

This recipe is for all of my grilled vegetable lovers out there. It’s simple to make – just grill veggies and blend dressing (literally) – and requires just 30 minutesfrom start to finish.
Roasted chickpeas are an optional add-in for extra protein and fiber to take this from side dish to entrée with virtually no extra time and little effort. Just roastthem while your corn is grilling. Garbanzos for the win!

That dressing though.
Think zesty sun-dried tomatoes blended with fresh lemon juice, basil, olive oil, garlic, and a touch of maple and salt and pepper for flavor balance. Super creamy, flavorful, and perfect on top of these smoky grilled vegetables.
Hubba.

I hope you all LOVE this salad. It’s:
Easy to make
Veggie-packed
Super healthy
Summery
Light + Fresh
Flavorful
&amp;Delicious
This is the perfect side dish for BBQs and dinner parties, especially in the summertime. Bring your veggies and grill them on the spot to wow your friends. They’ll be so impressed with your grilling/salad/delicious dressing skills. Make it an entrée with roasted chickpeas, or throw in some cooked pasta to keep things easy (like this recipe).
If you give this recipe a try, let us know how it goes! Leave a comment, rate it, and tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see your salad in action. Cheers, friends!

","Start by heating up your grill and prepping the corn and zucchini.Slice zucchini thinly lengthwise, brush lightly with avocado or grape seed oil (or another high-heat oil), and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside. Also soak corn (in husk) in cold water for 5 minutes.In the meantime, prepare your dressing by adding all ingredients (sun-dried tomatoes, hot water, lemon juice, basil, garlic, olive oil, maple syrup, salt, and pepper) to a blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth. If too thick, add more water to thin until pourable (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for acidity, garlic for zing, maple syrup for sweetness, salt + pepper for flavor balance, or basil for freshness/earthiness. Set aside.Once your grill is hot, add corn (still in husk) and cover. Cook for 5-8 minutes, rotating to cook all sides, until all sides are lightly browned. Then carefully remove husk and place back on grill until golden brown on all sides - about 5-8 minutes.When the corn is almost ready, add zucchini to the grill and grill on each side for about 2-4 minutes, depending on how hot the grill is. You want grill marks, but you don't want the zucchini to get too soft. Set aside.Cut corn off cob and halve zucchini. Then add to a serving bowl. At this time, add roasted chickpeas if desired (see notes for preparation). Drizzle with fresh lime juice and desired amount of dressing, and garnish with fresh basil and/or parsley.Best when fresh. Leftover dressing will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days."

Yesterday was the first day of summer on our side of the world and I’m one happy camper.
I decided to celebrate with these super summery, naturally sweetened, mango coconut energy bites (that aredelicious year-round).
Care to taste?

This recipe requires just 30 minutes and 6 ingredients to make!
Plus, they’re so easy. Simply soak dried mango, roast your nuts, blend, scoop, and roll into a coating of your choice.

For added protein, I threw in some hemp seeds (nature’s perfect complete protein with all 20 amino acids, including the 9 essential amino acids) andshredded coconut and lime zest formore flavor.
Nuts add plenty of healthy fats and protein as well – I went for a mix of walnuts and cashews – and dates help them stick together while adding a caramel-like natural sweetness. YUM.

I hope you all LOVE these bites! They’re:
SO easy
Summery
Tropical
Perfectly sweet-tart
Coconutty
Tender
Healthy
&amp; Delicious
These are the perfect snack to have around when you’re craving something sweet but healthy. Each bite provides a little fiber, protein, healthy fat, and natural sugars for an energy boost. Have one, have three, have six – no one’s looking.

Toast for 8-12 minutes or until light golden brown and fragrant. Set aside.In the meantime, add dried mango to a mixing bowl and cover with warm water (don't skip this step or they'll be too tough to blend). Let soak for 5-7 minutes or until soft and pliable but not too soggy. Then drain, lay on a towel, and pat off excess moisture. Set aside.Add nuts to a food processor and mix into a fine meal. Remove from bowl and set aside.Add pitted dates and soaked, dried mango to the food processor and mix until a rough paste/sticky dough forms.Add nut meal back in, along with hemp seeds, shredded coconut, lime zest (optional), and sea salt.

In my defense, these are delicious.I apologize in advance for offending anyone with this obviously overindulgent dessert.
But one bite in and I think you’ll be singing a different tune. Nay, even thanking me! Man, so glad we worked throughthis, guys.
What do you say? Let’s make whoopie pie s’mores!

Do you know what a whoopie pie is? If not, go study up.
Part of the lure of s’mores is the crunchy graham crackers (for that, try these S’mores Bars). But what if the chocolate bar was the slightly “crunchy” part, and the crackers were replaced with soft and tender chocolate cake?
I mean…what’s not to love? I knew you’d come around.

These s’mores are easy to make, as the whoopie cakes require just 1 bowl! The rest happens on a baking sheet (or over the open fire if you’re cool like that – just don’t rub it in our faces).
The assembly is quite easy. Make cakes, top with chocolate and marshmallows, toast, top with fruit (optional for color), smash, and enjoy!

I’m quite smitten with these s’mores! They’re:
Chocolaty
Gooey
Sweet
Toasty
Marshmallow-stuffed
Summery
&amp; Kind of awesome
These are thee perfect dessert for warm weather, especially BBQs and outdoor gatherings. If you’re going camping, make the cakes ahead of time, toast your mallows on the fire, and go to town! What a lovely summer activity that would be. It’s officially added to my summer bucket list.

Let rest for 5 minutes while you prepare your other ingredients.Add the oil, coconut sugar, and maple syrup and whisk to combine.Next, add applesauce, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine. Then add almond milk mixture and whisk again until everything is thoroughly incorporated - about 30 seconds.Lastly, add baking powder, cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour, and gluten-free flour, and whisk to combine, making sure no large lumps remain.Transfer batter to the refrigerator to chill/thicken for 20 minutes, and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Grease two large baking sheets (use more or less if altering batch size) with nonstick spray (if you don’t have two baking sheets, just use one and bake the cakes in 3-4 batches).Once the oven is preheated, scoop out 1 heaping Tbsp amount of batter onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch of room for spreading. Use your tablespoon to slightly spread them into a small disc. One standard baking sheet should fit 12 cakes. Repeat on second baking sheet.Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until the edges appear dry. (I found 12 minutes to be the perfect time.) Remove from oven and let rest on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to cooling racks to cool completely.Repeat this process, baking the mini cakes until all batter is used - you should have about 40-48 total cakes.Once the cakes are completely cooled, arrange half of the cakes on 1-2 baking sheets (upside down) and top each with a chocolate square and several halved marshmallows.Broil on the top rack of the oven on high broil until toasty and brown. Watch carefully as they will burn/toast quickly! (Alternatively, if using a grill or campfire, toast the marshmallows over the fire and place between cakes once toasted).Top with fruit (optional) and another cake of similar size and shape and press down slightly.Enjoy immediately! Best when fresh.Leftover cakes will keep covered at room temperature up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month."
349,Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli

“Get that corn outta my face.”
Anybody? Name that movie and we’re best friends forever.

It’s grilling season (at least in our cornerof the world) and I’m wasting no time hopping on the corn bandwagon.
John has gotten quite skilled at grilling corn, but he was busythe day I was attempting this recipe so I was alone “womaning” the grill. I like that. It has a ring to it.
This 10-ingredient recipe is for those of you wanting something a little special this grilling season. Grilled corn is great and all, but what about with lime juice, sriracha aioli, and fresh herbs!?
That’s what I thought. Follow me. I’ll show you how.

I share my best corn grilling tips in the instructions, so be sure to study up for fool-proof grilled corn!
As for the aioli, it’s a simple blend of soaked cashews, garlic, spices, lime juice, and sriracha. Mmmm.Think creamy, zesty, spicy, smoky, slightly sweet, and seriously delicious. It pairs perfectly against smoky-sweet corn.


I hope you all love this easy grilled corn! It’s:
Smoky
Sweet
Spicy from the aioli
Zesty
Summery
Fresh
&amp; Soeasy
This is the perfect snack or side dish to all your BBQ season favorites, like veggie burgers, portobello steaks, and tomato + cantaloupe salad. Dream big and eat all the corn.

","Place cashews in a bowl and cover with boiling hot water. Let set, uncovered, for 45 minutes - 1 hour (or until very soft). Then drain thoroughly and set aside.In the meantime, prep corn by putting in a large bowl and covering with cool water for about 10 minutes to prevent it from burning too much on the grill. Then place on a baking sheet and set aside. Prep any other toppings at this time (cilantro, limes, chili powder, etc.).Begin preheating grill once cashews are almost soaked. Then add soaked, drained cashews to the blender along with fresh garlic, water, olive oil (start with lesser end of range), maple syrup, lime juice, salt, pepper, sriracha, and spices. Nutritional yeast is optional.Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more water if too thick, salt for flavor balance, sriracha for heat, cumin for smokiness, garlic for zing, maple syrup for sweetness, or lime juice for acidity. Transfer to a serving dish and set aside.To grill corn, place (unhusked) directly on the hot grill for about 7-8 minutes and close the lid. Rotate/flip at the halfway point to ensure even cooking. This begins gently cooking the corn before laying it directly on the grill.Once the husk is browned, pull back the husk (optional to remove completely) and place back on the grill. Close the lid but watch closely, rotating until all sides of the corn are deep golden brown.To serve, drizzle corn with aioli, lime juice (a must!), chili powder and sprinkle on fresh herbs.

350,Chickpea Shawarma Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chickpea Shawarma Dip

Chickpeas on chickpeas on chickpeas.
That’s how we do it around here.
Who wants some dip?

This dip is inspired by my favorite thing ever to order at Mediterranean restaurants: Either falafel(better than restaurant or easy vegan) or shawarma dip.
The base is hummus, which I kept easy and used store bought. But you could just as easilyuse my go-to 5-minute hummus recipe.
Next is my favorite shawarma baked chickpeas, which I love on top of salads and in sandwiches.Next? Bring on the greens.

In place of classic tabbouleh, I prefer an all-parsley salad with tomato, onion, and just a dash of olive oil and lemon juice. It’s so bright and citrusy and pairs so well with this dip.

All that’s left is my go-to 4-ingredient garlic dill sauce (borrowed from my Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes – a reader favorite!). It’s the perfect topper to this easy, 30-minute dip that’s savory, fresh, and full of healthy fats, fiber, and plant-based protein.

I hope you LOVE this dip! It’s:
Savory
Creamy
Fresh
Flavorful
Hearty
Healthy
&amp; SOdelicious
This is the perfect appetizer or sidefor Mediterranean night, whether it’s paired with falafel, roasted sweet potatoes,or salad! I especially love this the next day as leftovers, as the flavors seem to develop the longer it sits. Pair with pita bread, chips, or vegetables for a seriously hearty, flavorful dip.

Originally, this was supposedto be avocado chia seed chocolate pudding for the May Bonus Recipe.
However, that didn’t work out so well. Turns out, no matter how much melted dark chocolate Ipour overavocados, it still kinda tastes like chocolate avocado. Back to the drawing board.
Newidea: Banana Split Chocolate Smoothie!
Good news: Smashing success. So delicious, in fact, that it was destined for the blog (I mean, look at that glam shot). Hubba.

This smoothie is such a simple concept but delivers big on flavor and decadence.
It starts with frozen bananas blended with cacao powder and almondbutter. Next comes a couple of dates for sweetness, almond milk, and vanilla extract. The result is a rich, chocolaty, banana-infused shake that’s insanelydelicious. Plus, just 9 ingredients, 1 blender, and 10 minutes required.
Let’s serve this baby up and get to snacking, shall we?

How is this a banana split smoothie, you ask?
For starters, it has three bananas! Two in the smoothie and one for serving. Get it? Banana split in the glass? You guys are smart.
For toppings, I went with plenty of coconut whipped cream, shredded coconut, cacao nibs (a must!), and a cherry.

I think you’re going to LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Decadent
Rich
Creamy
Super chocolaty
Naturally sweet
Antioxidant-rich
&amp; So delicious
This would make a perfectly suitable breakfast if you prefer sweeter smoothies, but I see it as more of a dessert! The coconut whip, shredded coconut, and cacao nibs send it over the top (highly recommended)!

Friends, welcome to grilling season.
I know what you’re thinking. Here we go with the fake meat substitutes and crumbly veggie burgers (see my Grillable Veggie Burgers here!).
But not so fast!Here’s my new, go-to plant-based option: Grilled portobello mushrooms in a saucy marinade with spicy avocado chimichurri.
Yeah, yum.

This recipe is inspired by my absolute favorite veggie burger at the moment, which isin our (new and improved, entirely plant-based) 31 Meals eCookbook!
They take about 30 minutes and are insanely easy to make. Justmarinade, make your chimichurri, grill the mushrooms, dig in.It’s go time.

When I was first conceiving recipe, I thought chimichurri – a citrusy, classic “steak” sauce with loads of parsley – would be a perfect pairing. And when I tasted it, I knew something was missing. Avocado to the rescue for seriously buttery texture and loads of nutrients.
Oh avocado, what can’t you do?

These steaks are great on the grill or on the stovetop! I personally prefer a cast iron skillet since the entire surface gets browned and caramelized.
I hope you LOVE these steaks! They’re:
Hearty
Flavorful
Zesty
Herby
Buttery from the avocado
Extremely nutritious
&amp; SO easy
This is the perfect option forall your summer grilling needs. They’re great on their own butwould also pair well with salads, mashed potatoes, or cooked quinoa or rice (links below!).

354,S'mores Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"S’mores Bars (Vegan + GF)

I know. S’mores BARS!
This is real life, people. No more talking– let’s do this.

This recipe was conceived after having possibly the best dessert of my life (BIG words) at Solstice in Hood River(which also inspired this lovely Pear Salad!).
Solstice serves up a gluten free s’mores dessert in a skillet and it is absolute perfection. One bite in and I started taking notes.
The crust was homemade and more like a granola mixture than graham cracker. The chocolate layer was a ganache/pudding hybrid. And the marshmallow topping was insanely fluffy, sweet, and definitely homemade. So good I couldn’t quit taking giant spoonfuls.
This is my inspired version that comes together in less than 1 hour with just 10 ingredients!

For the crust I went with my go-to almond-oat crust and threw in some pecans for more texture.
The filling is a modification of myfavorite chocolate ganache.
And to keep things easy, I went with my new favorite vegan, gluten-free marshmallows: Dandies! So good you can’t tell the difference between them and the ‘real thing.’
Friends, these bars are magic. They’re:
Crispy on the bottom
Chocolaty in the middle
Fluffy and toasted on top
Perfectly sweet
Rich
Satisfying
&amp; So summery
Thinks’mores but on a whole other level. Plus, they’re easy to make and are a great way to keep this summer classic both vegan and gluten free!

This should form a loose dough when squeezed between two fingers. Add more if it's too dry.Add chopped pecans and pulse a few more times to combine - you want a little texture here so leave a little chunky.Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking sheet and spread evenly. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed.Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-10 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly.In the meantime, add chocolate to a medium mixing bowl. Add almond milk to a separate small mixing bowl or measuring cup and microwave for 30 seconds (or heat in a saucepan until almost boiling). Add milk to chocolate and don’t touch for 5 minutes so it can melt.Stir gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate. Then add melted coconut oil and cover. Let rest untouched for another 10 minutes to meld.Use a mixer (or whisk) to beat the mixture together. A few unmelted chocolate pieces are fine. If you prefer sweeter ganache, add powdered sugar at this time (to taste), and whisk/beat to combine. Set aside.Spread the ganache over slightly cooled crust and sprinkle on a little sea salt for flavor balance (optional). Freeze (or refrigerate) until ganache is no longer wet and slightly firm (or less time if you want gooey, melty chocolate!).Once the chocolate has set, lift the bars out of the baking dish and gently transfer to a baking sheet (remove parchment paper to avoid burning). Top with halved marshmallows and broil on the top rack on high for 30-45 seconds (watch closely - they can burn quickly!).Carefully chop into 9 bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and serve immediately. Best when fresh. Store leftovers at room temperature, loosely covered up to 24 hours."
355,Pear Balsamic Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pear Salad with Dried Cherries and Candied Walnuts

Every once in a while, a restaurant salad catches me off guard and I set off to investigate how it’s made.
I ask the server where the ingredients are from and what’s in the dressing and what makes it so…extra delicious?
One such salad inspired this 30-minute recipe, and it lives at Solstice Pizza in Hood River, Oregon – a must-visit if you’re ever in the Portland area and cravingsome killer gluten-free, vegan pizza.

The concept is easy, but it’s all in the texture and flavor combinations.
The base is gorgeous mixed greens.
The fruit is tender, ripe pear.
Dried cherries add a slight chew and tartness.
Super simple candied walnuts add crunch, nuttiness, and subtle sweetness.
And it’s all tossed in a tangy, 4-ingredient balsamic vinaigrette.


The result is a super fresh, semi-sweet salad with layers of flavor and texture.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and add raw walnuts to a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet.Once oven is preheated, toast walnuts for 7 minutes. Then remove from oven and add remaining ingredients directly to the walnuts (oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup, sea salt, cinnamon and cayenne - optional). Use a spatula to thoroughly toss/combine.Place back in oven and roast for another 4-6 minutes or until fragrant and golden brown. Set aside to cool.In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding all ingredients to a jar (or mixing bowl) and shaking vigorously (or whisking) to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more balsamic for acidity, salt or pepper for flavor balance, or olive oil for creaminess. Set aside.To serve, add greens, half of the sliced pear, dried cherries, and half of the roasted walnuts to a large mixing/serving bowl. Drizzle with a bit of the dressing and toss to combine.Plate and garnish with remaining pears and walnuts, and serve with remaining dressing. Best when fresh, though leftovers store separately in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Store walnuts well sealed at room temperature."
356,Quinoa Taco Meat | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Taco Meat

Were you a picky eater as a kid?
I was (kind of).When it came to fruit I rememberonly likingcanned pears (yeah, weird, I know).
Lunch was almost always a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and dinner was often cheese and shells. If my parents put creamed corn on the table, it was a guaranteed meltdown (hated the stuff).
Desserts on the other hand? So easy to please, so long as coconut flake, cherries, or raisins weren’t involved.
Another menu itemI could always get behind? Tacos. My family lovedcrispy tacos with ground beef and lots of salsa. My favorite thing to do was mix in some corn tothe filling – I know, classy move. You don’t have to tell me how refined my palate was at 6 years old.

These days, ground beef isn’t my go-to filling for tacos. But sometimes the 6-year-old in me misses itscrumbly texture and flavor.
I think you see where this is going. Quinoa makes an excellent substitution! It’s almost uncanny. Come see how.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and simple methods.
Preparequinoa, season with spices and salsa, bake until crispy, devour. See? I told you it was easy.
I got the idea for this recipe when I made my Spanish Stuffed Peppers for dinner one nightand some of the quinoa spilled over in the pan and got all crispy and delicious while baking – I couldn’t get enough. That was mylight bulb moment.


I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Easy
Healthy
Extremely flavorful
Picky-eater-approved
Versatile
Satisfying
&amp; So delicious
This is the perfect filling for all your Mexican night needs: Tacos, burrito bowls (find my 30-minute recipe in our Everyday Cooking Cookbook!), taco salads, nachos, enchiladas, tostadas (also in the cookbook) – you name it, it works!

","Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add rinsed quinoa and toast for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently.Add vegetable broth and water and bring back to a boil over medium-high heat. Then reduce heat to low, cover with a secure lid, and cook for 15-25 minutes, or until liquid is completely absorbed. Fluff with a fork, then crack lid and let rest for 10 minutes off heat.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Add cooked quinoa to a large mixing bowl and add remaining ingredients (salsa, nutritional yeast, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and oil). Toss to combine. Then spread on a lightly greased (or parchment-lined) baking sheet.Bake for 20-35 minutes, stirring/tossing once at the halfway point to ensure even baking. The quinoa is done when it's fragrant and golden brown. Be careful not to burn!This quinoa taco meat goes extremely well in crispy taco shells and soft taco shells, and I also think it would be perfect on nachos, taco salads, tostadas, and in enchiladas. Dream big!Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Reheat in the microwave, in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven, or in a skillet on the stovetop."
357,Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream

I’ve been on a mission to create creamy, rich vegan chocolate ice cream, and it almost stumped me.
Myfirst attempt lackeddepth ofdark chocolate flavor.
My second attempt came closer, but lackedcreaminess.
And my third attempt? Total winner.
Creamy, insanely rich chocolate flavor that’s somewhere between ice cream and gelato. Get your ice cream maker, kids. We’re doin’ this.

This recipe requires just 6 ingredients and simple methods. If you can whisk, blend, and pour into an ice cream maker, you can master this easy recipe.
The base is comprised of water, cocoa powder, rich coconut cream, and organic cane sugar, which is whisked together. Then comes the deep chocolate flavor: from plenty of vegan dark chocolate.
The last ingredient is vanilla extract, which enhances the flavor and helps prevent ice crystals (because of the alcohol content). Then simply blend, chill, and wait patiently until it’s time to churn.


This ice cream is insanely creamyand so, so rich in chocolate flavor. It satisfied that craving I had for the chocolate ice cream I enjoyedback in my dairy-eating days.
This will make the perfect treat to have on hand this summer for snacking or for hosting. I highly recommend serving this with fresh strawberries and coconut whipped cream. And whoops, what if a raw brownie falls in the bowl? Bliss.

Don’t act like you don’t talk to your food, too. Sheesh.

These bars were inspired by all of the insanely delicious berries and rhubarb at the store right now. It’s that time of year for all the spring and summertimetreats loaded with fruit.
Who’s with me?!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients.
Plus, they’re vegan, gluten-free, naturally sweetened, andmade with coconut oil! Healthier treats for the win (hands raised emoji).

The filling is made with rhubarb and berries, orange juice, coconut sugar, and cornstarch for thickening.
And the topping is a simple mixture of gluten free oats and flour, coconut oil, and coconut sugar.
Are you sensing a theme here? I love coconut sugar and oil like whoa.

The result is a crust reminiscent of graham crackers (I KNOW) topped with super fruity, tart-sweet filling and crunchyoat crumble.

OK, fine. We eat it in stretchy pants while watching Netflix and Hulu. Are you happy?
Our Thai food rotation has been a mix ofMango Curry, SpringRolls, and Pad Thai (recipe in 31 Meals). And our current obsession?Papaya Salad.

When we were in Mexico recently, I got a little addicted to piña coladas.
As in two to three a day every day while sweating away in the hot sun under a cabana while reading a book and feeling the ocean breeze. It was lovely. It was paradise. Did I mention I want to move there?

Piña coladascombine all of my favorite summertime flavors: coconut, pineapple, and rum. Do I even have to explain myself? It’s the only cocktail Ineed when poolside or at the beach.
I wanted to make aninspired version and my mind immediately went to Popsicles. Popsicles are more accessible than ice cream, take way less effort, and still deliver a creamy treat reminiscent of my favorite drink. It’s a win-win if you think about it.
Plus, this recipe requires just 4 ingredients and 30 minutes of hands-on prep! The rest of the magic happens in the freezer while you’re airing up your pool floaties and slathering yourself with sunscreen.Summer, it’s a beautiful thing.

The show stopper in this meal is the almond butter tofu.
Tofu is pressed dry, tossedin cornstarch, lightly browned, then sautéed in my almond butter stir-fry sauce until savory, sweet, and perfectly crisp.

This pie is pretty much amazing and it’s easy to make, requiring just10 basic ingredients and simple methods.
The crust is my go-to almond-oat creation that I discovered while making my Peanut Butter and Jelly Snack Bars (&lt;- serious yum, btw). It’s crispy, perfectly sweet, wholesome, and somehow ends up tasting reminiscent of graham cracker crust! I know, it’s magic.

The filling has two parts: pudding and coconut whipped cream.

The pudding is a mixture of cornstarch, sugar, almond milk, and vanilla. It’s thickened on the stovetop, cooled, and then mixed with fluffy coconut whip for a sinfully delicious, creamy, rich filling to be poured over your bananas and crust. Swoon.

364,Rhubarb Strawberry Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Rhubarb Strawberry Margaritas

If you’vefollowed the blog for a while, you know I have a thing for margaritas.
I love how tart and sweet they are, and tequila happens to be one of my favorite liquors.
Plus, they pair perfectly with Mexican food. Need I say more?

This recipe was inspired by spring.
It’s definitely feeling like spring going on summer here in the Northwest. The days have been getting sunnier and longer, which means I can sleep in, get to work later, and still get all of my work done sincethe sun doesn’t go down until 7. Can’t it be this way all year round? I wish.
Besides the beautiful weather, one of the reasons I love spring so much is the produce! Specifically, rhubarb. So when I was atthe grocery store recently and spotted a beautiful bushel of rhubarb, I knew it was time for some serious recipe development.
Margaritas it was.

These margaritas are made with 6 simple ingredients, are low in sugar per serving, and celebrate the natural earthy sweetness of rhubarb and strawberry.
The first step is to make a rhubarb strawberry “syrup” with water, fruit, organic cane sugar, and a little orange juice. Let itsimmer until almost liquid, and then drain until you have a beautiful, vibrant fruit syrup.

Once cooled, it’s time for happy hour. Add a bit of your syrup to a cocktail shaker with lime juice, silver tequila, agave nectar, and ice (that’s it!) and shake it like you mean it.
Serve over ice with a salted rim for flavor contrast (my favorite) or a sugar rim for more sweetness.

I think you’re going to LOVE this margarita! It’s:
Slightly tart
Not too sweet
Strawberry-rhubarb infused
Boozy
Refreshing
&amp; Seriously delicious
I think this would make the perfect afternoon or evening cocktail for warmer weather when you want something fruity and light. It’s amazing on its own, but I also think it would pairdeliciously with pretty much any Mexican dish, especially nachos, salads, and veggie burgers!

","Add rhubarb, strawberries, organic cane sugar, water and orange juice (optional) to a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.Once simmering, reduce heat to low and continue cooking until softened and it looks like pie filling - about 5 minutes. While cooking, use a wooden spoon to stir and mash the fruit.Remove from heat and let cool slightly, then add a fine mesh strainer over a mixing bowl and pour over the mixture. Use a spoon to make sweeping motions across the bottom of the mesh strainer to encourage the liquid to strain. Continue until you've extracted as much of the liquid ""syrup"" as possible.Transfer syrup to a glass jar to the refrigerator to cool - at least a few hours. To speed cooling time, place in freezer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.Run a lime wedge around desired number of serving glasses and dip in salt or organic cane sugar (I like salt for a flavor contrast). Add a large ice cube (or several small ice cubes) to the glass, and set aside. Set in the freezer for an extra chilly margarita!Next, to make one margarita, add 75 ml strawberry rhubarb syrup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a cocktail shaker, along with lime juice, tequila, agave nectar, and a handful of ice.Shake vigorously to combine. Pour out a small amount to sample, then adjust flavors as needed, adding more agave nectar for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or strawberry rhubarb syrup for fruitiness.Pour over serving glass and enjoy! The syrup makes enough for about 3-4 margaritas, and will keep in the refrigerator covered up to 1 week (sometimes longer)."
365,Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir-Fry

I realized something lately. The blog does not have nearly enough stir-fries considering how much I enjoy them.
I view stir-fries as the easiest, tastiestway to use up whatever produce you have on hand. Just serve over quinoa or brown rice and you havea seriously hearty, vegetable-packed, nutritious meal.
When I want something super hearty, I look no further than portobello mushrooms.

Can I tell you a secret? My absolute favoriteportobello mushroom recipe at the moment is in our 31 Meals eCookbook (which has been recently updated to be entirely plant-based!).
Think juicy portobello burgers with a creamy vegan garlic aioli sauce. It’s so good my eyes rolled back in my head whenI took my first bite.
Since then, my affection for portobellos has grown into full blown obsession. I had to put them in a stir-fry – there was no question.

This stir fry requires 10 basic ingredientsand comes together in about 30 minutes!
The marinade is the perfect balance of savory, citrusy, and sweet. And the mushrooms soak it all up and get incredibly juicy and flavorful.

Once your portobellos have had a few minutes to marinate, it’s onto the stovetop, where they get a sear on both sides and begin to slightly caramelize. Oh mama.

For vegetables, I went with red bell pepper and broccolini. But I think you could use pretty much anything you have on hand!This isa very flexible, adaptable recipe that delivers big on flavor.
I hope you love this stir fry! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Healthy
Simple
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect plant-based meal when you’re craving something heartybut healthy. I think it would be especially great for hosting because just about everyone loves stir-fry and it’s so satisfying no one will realize they’re eating an entirely vegan/gluten-free meal.

","Cook rice (or cauliflower rice) if serving with stir-fry. I prefer this method from Saveur.Next, wipe portobello mushrooms clean with a slightly damp towel (do not immerse in water or they will get soggy) and slice into thin strips (see photo).Prepare marinade by adding all ingredients to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more ginger for brightness, lime juice for acidity, tamari for saltiness, red pepper flake for heat, or maple syrup for sweetness.Add portobello mushrooms to a large shallow dish, such as a 9x13-inch baking pan, and top with marinade. Gently stir/toss to combine. Set aside to marinate for 10-12 minutes while you prep your vegetables. Toss occasionally to evenly coat.Chop vegetables and set aside. Once portobellos have marinated, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a bit of sesame oil. Then add only as many portobellos as will fit comfortably in the pan (see photo), and sauté for 2-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and slightly seared. You may have to do this in two batches depending on the size of your pan.Set portobellos aside and loosely cover to keep warm. Then add red pepper and broccolini to the pan and increase heat to medium-high. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.Add the green onion (optional) and any remaining portobello marinade and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute. Then remove from heat and serve immediately. Cooking the vegetables for a short time on very high heat will give them a nice sear and prevent them from getting soggy.Enjoy as is or with chili garlic sauce, sesame seeds, or a garnish of chopped green onion. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Reheat in the microwave or the stovetop."
366,Brown Rice Sushi | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Veggie Brown Rice Sushi

About once a week, I crave sushi. As in: give it to me I gotta haveit.
Thankfully, we have an amazing sushi shop within walking distance from our place, but every once in a while, I get the itchto make it myself.
Sure, it takes more time. But it’s very affordable to make at home. Plus, you can customize your fillings and create your dream veggie roll.Let me show you how.

If you don’t have a sushi mat, I’ve got you covered. Check out our How to Make Sushi Without a Mat tutorial.
But because they’re so affordable and make the process more streamlined, I picked up a mat for this version.
It may look complicated, but sushi is truly easy tomake. I compare it to rolling spring rolls. Sure, your first few are a little imperfect. But once you get the hang of it, it’s so easy and you feel incredibly accomplished making your own restaurant-worthy food at home.
All in all, this sushi requires just 10 simple ingredients (more or less depending on your fillings of choice) and comes together in less than 1 hour.

It starts with wholesome brown rice that’s mixed with a vinegar mixture to sweeten it slightly and make it sticky so it’s easier to work with.
I tested it without the vinegar mixture, and trust me, it did not gowell. You need the rice to be sticky so it forms a roll.

For fillings I went with roasted red pepper,cucumber,sprouts, and carrots.
I also love veggie rolls with avocado, asparagus, radish, and pickled veggies. Dream big, friends. The options are endless.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Hearty
Healthy
Veggie-packed
Crunchy
Tender
Satisfying
&amp; So delicious
Make this for weeknight meals when you want somethinghearty and other than a salad (although no shame in a salad).

","In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil then add rice, swirl to coat, and lower heat to low and cover. Simmer until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender – about 18-25 minutes. Drain off any excess water if there is any.In the meantime, add vinegar, sugar and salt to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat stirring occasionally until sugar and salt are dissolved. Place in a jar or dish and cool in the fridge until rice is ready.Once the rice is done, kill the heat and add the cooled vinegar mixture and stir with a rubber spatula or fork as to not overmix. It will appear wet but will dry up as you lightly stir to release heat. It should be sticky and completely dry once it’s ready.While the rice finishes cooking, prep your veggies by chopping them into thin pieces. If they’re too bulky they won’t allow the sushi to roll well.Now it’s time to roll: Grab your sushi mat and top with a sheet of nori. Using your hands dipped in water (to avoid sticking), pat a very thin layer of rice all over the nori, making sure it’s not too thick or your roll will be all rice and no filling (see photo).Then, arrange a generous serving of your veggies or preferred filling in a line at the bottom 3/4 of the rice closest to you (see photo).Start to roll the nori and rice over with your fingers, and once the veggies are covered, roll the mat over to mold and compress the roll. Continue until it’s all the way rolled up. I find slicing with a very sharp serrated knife yields the best results. Repeat until all rice and fillings are used up - about 4 total rolls (amount as original recipe is written // will vary if altering batch size).Serve immediately with pickled ginger, tamari or soy sauce, and wasabi. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 2 days."
367,Crispy Baked Vegan Tacos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Tacos with Pineapple Salsa

When one masters the art of cooking beans from scratch (go me!), one must find delicious things to do with said beans.
And the thing my mind instantly goes to is tacos.

Did you ever have crispy tacos growing up?
That was one of my favorite meals. Crispy taco shells with tons offillings that always,always involved corn and cheese. As you can tell,little Dana liked her carbs and dairy.
But instead of frying the shells, I figured out a simple way to bake them and get them crispy! Simply fold the edges over a baking sheet and bake on top of a second baking sheet. Or, rest mini cupcake liners inside a folded over soft tortilla and bake until crispy and golden (see image below)!
Yes, it’s that easy. And the whole recipe comes together in just 30 minutes.

For fillings, I immediately knew I wanted to go for my Mexican Pinto Beans from Scratch (made in 1 pot).
And because I’ve been seeing pineapples popping up everywhere these days, I paired it with a simple pineapple salsa. However, you could always keep it simple and use your favorite store-bought salsa, or try my go-to Blended Red Salsa recipe.

I hope you guys love these tacos! They’re:
Crispy
Savory
Satisfying
Loaded with healthy fillings
Quick
&amp; Delicious

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and get out two baking sheets as well as a few mini cupcake liners if you have them. As long as you have either cupcake liners or two baking sheets, you can make this method work!Lightly brush tortillas on both sides with oil and sprinkle with salt. Then stack two baking sheets and lift one side. Tuck as many tortillas as will fit comfortably on the edge. Then lower the top baking sheet and fold the tortilla over the top so it forms a shell shape. In addition or alternatively, simply arrange tortillas on a baking sheet, fold over, and slide two mini cupcake liners inside the shell so it creates an opening. See photo for guidance!Bake 10-20 minutes (will depend on brand and freshness) until light brown and crisp. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.While tortillas are baking, add pinto beans to a small pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat, then lower heat to low and simmer until serving. Taste and season - I suggest ground cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste.Lastly, prepare pineapple salsa by adding all ingredients to a small bowl and tossing to coat. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more salt for flavor balance, lime for acidity, or pineapple for sweetness. Set aside.Once tacos are done baking and slightly cooled, fill generously with pinto beans, pineapple, and other toppings. I went with avocado, hot sauce, and cilantro.The shells are best when fresh. I would only make as many as you want to enjoy immediately as they tend to lose their crispiness when stored."
368,Matcha Green Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Matcha Green Smoothie Bowl

Are you a green tea fan?
I’ve been cutting back on coffee lately. I find it ratheracidic on my stomach, and in my old age, it now makes me jittery (true story).
But on mornings that I need a little pick-me-up, I love a warm cup of green tea.

We all know that green tea has antioxidant benefits. But did you know that powdered green tea – also known as matcha – has 137 times moreantioxidants than brewed green tea?
Friends, that’s a lot of antioxidants. And we all know antioxidants are importantbecause they fight cancer-causing free radicals in the body (among other benefits).
Plus, can we just talk about how delicious matcha powder is mixed with coconut milk and a little maple syrup? Hello afternoon green tea latte bliss.

Have you tried asmoothie bowlyet?
It’s a fun way to slow down and enjoy your smoothie as more of a meal with a spoon (as opposed to slurping it down with a straw). Plus, you get to add more nutritious foods with toppings like fruit, nuts, and seeds.
I hope you all love my 4-ingredient, 5-minute take on the matcha green smoothie! Banana creates a creamy, sweet base; coconut milk adds creaminess and complements the greentea flavor;and the matcha powder adds mega health benefits and an earthy, tea flavor. Pineapple is an optional ingredient that balances the sweetness with a bit of tartness.

","Add frozen banana slices, pineapple (optional), lesser amount of coconut milk (3/4 cup or 180 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), matcha powder, and spinach to a blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth.Add only as much coconut milk as you need to help it blend. In my opinion, you want this smoothie somewhere between scoopable and drinkable.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana (or a touch of maple syrup or stevia) for sweetness, matcha for more intense green tea flavor, or coconut milk for creaminess (though adding more matcha powder adds more caffeine, so use your best discretion). Pineapple will add a little tart/tang, so add more if desired.Divide between two serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I went with fresh raspberries, chia seeds, and coconut flake. Bananas would make a delicious garnish as well.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep well sealed in the refrigerator up to 24 hours."
369,White Chocolate Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake

Raise your hand if you like white chocolate macadamia nut cookies! (Ooh me, me, me!)
OK, all of you come with me. We’re makin’ (vegan, gluten-free, almost raw) cheesecake.

This cheesecake isinspired by my favorite cookie flavor, and one of my most loved cheesecake flavors.
White chocolate and macadamia nuts were seemingly meant for each other, and I did my best to capture theirperfectflavorpairing in this 10-ingredient cheesecake.
The crustis a mixture of walnuts, macadamia nuts, dates, and sea salt. And the filling gets its creamy texture fromsoakedcashews, coconut milk, and olive oil. Plus, it’snaturally sweetened with maple syrupand gets that richwhite chocolate flavor from cocoa butter – hubba.

Throw a few macadamia nuts onto the bottom of the crust, pour in the filling, top with a few more nuts, and they’re ready for the freezer.
These set surprisingly fast, and, thanks to cocoa butter, they can set out at room temperature without “melting” for much longer thantraditional raw cheesecakes.

At room temperature, these cheesecakes arean absolute dream – super creamy and rich with tons of white chocolate macadamia nut flavor.
If you so choose to accept the mission, upgrade them with the addition ofcoconut whipped cream, toasted coconut, fresh raspberries, andmacadamia nuts. Then you’re looking at a little slice of dessert heaven.

I hope you all love these cheesecakes! They’re:
Rich
Creamy
Perfectly (naturally) sweet
White chocolate-infused
Studded with crunchy macadamia nuts
Simple
&amp; Seriously satisfying
These would make the perfect cheesecakes to enjoythis spring and summer, especially for graduations, baby and bridal showers, and summer BBQs. Just keep them in the freezer to for maximum freshness,and let thaw before serving. Don’t forget the coconut whip!

","Soak cashews by adding to a small mixing bowl and covering with boiling hot water. Let sit uncovered for 1 hour.In the meantime, add dates to a blender and mix until small bits remain or it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Next, add walnuts, macadamia nuts, and salt (optional) and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more nuts.For serving dishes you have several options - muffin tins, ramekins (like these), or a springform pan of your choice. With whatever option you choose, be sure to line with parchment paper for easy removal.For the ramekins shown above, cut out parchment paper into circles the shape of your ramekins, as well as two thick strips of parchment paper per ramekin and lay them in an ""X"" shape at the base. Top with circle shape. This creates little tabs that make removing the cheesecakes easier to pop out once set.Divide crust among ramekins and carefully press with fingers to distribute. To pack it down, use a small glass lined with parchment paper (or the back of a spoon) to and really press it down, allowing some crust to come up the sides. Set in the refrigerator or freezer to firm up.Add soaked drained cashews, vanilla extract, coconut milk, olive oil, maple syrup, melted cocoa butter, lemon juice, and sea salt (optional) to the blender and mix until very smooth - up to 2-3 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice, maple syrup/agave or a splash more coconut milk as the liquid should help it blend better.Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed, adding more melted cocoa butter for chocolate flavor, lemon juice for brightness, salt for flavor balance, or maple syrup for sweetness.Add a small handful of macadamia nuts to the crust ramekins (see photo), then divide filling evenly among the ramekins (or other serving dish). Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then top with a few more macadamia nuts and cover loosely with plastic wrap.Freeze until set - about 4-6 hours depending on size of dish. Once set, run a butter knife along the edge and gently remove by tugging on the tabs in an upward motion. They should pop right out. If they aren't quite set, pop them in the freezer for 15-20 minutes and they should come out easily.To serve, slice and enjoy as is, or top with a touch of coconut whipped cream, toasted coconut, macadamia nuts, and fresh berries.Store leftovers in a well-covered dish in the refrigerator up to a few days or in the freezer up to 2-3 weeks."
370,Mexican Pinto Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Pinto Beans From Scratch (1 Pot)

Can I admit something? I had only cooked beans from scratch once before testingthis recipe. And that’s because I’m not usually the type to prep dinners hours ahead of time, or make large quantities of food for later use.
However,I recognize the merit in cooking your own beans from scratch. For starters, alot of canned products are heavy in salt and often contain preservatives and other additives (such as BPA) that aren’t so great for you in large quantities. Not to mention, cooking your own beans is considerably cheaper, making it far more cost effective than buying canned.
Plus, it’s seriously simple. If I can do it, you can do it. Let me show you how!

This recipe is simple to make requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 pot to prepare.
Manytraditional Mexican pinto bean recipes require bacon or ham hocks to prepare, but to keep mine plant-based, I relied on vegetable broth, garlic, onion, and diced tomatoes and green chilies. And foreven more flavor, I addedchili powder, cumin, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

Hands-on prep time is really only 15-20 minutes, sincethe soaking and cooking take place while you do other things.
The brilliant thing is this recipe yields about 5 cups cooked pinto beans, which you can enjoy throughout the week for super easy, quick meals. Oryou can store leftovers in freezer-safe bags or jars to savefor future meals.

I think you guys are going to love these easy, 1-Pot beans. They’re:
Smoky
Hearty
Tender
Flavorful
Perfectly spiced
Satisfying
&amp; Delicious
These beans are great on their own as a snack with guacamole and chips (hello, lunch). They also make a great addition to meals like tacos, nachos, veggie burgers, burrito bowls, salads, and chili.

Idon’t know anyone (besides John) who doesn’t love brownies. (Trust me, I’ve tried to convince him otherwise.)
Fudgy, rich,super chocolaty, studded with delicious things. If I were to say I hada “vice,” it would probably be brownies (or ice cream – tough call).

These brownies are simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients and 30 minutes (plus cooling) to prepare!
They’re also naturally sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrupand gluten-free thanks to almond meal and gluten-free flour.
As a baker, there’s a part of me gets superexcited over the fact that it’s possible toturn otherwise dairy- and gluten-filled desserts into something everyone can enjoy. I think everyone should be able to havebrownies – is that such a crime?

Cucumbers areimportant to add to your diet because they’re 95% water and naturallydetoxify your body; are high in Vitamins A, B and C; and containphytonutrients that provideanti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer effects.
They’re also a secret weapon for nails and hair, thanks to the nutrient silica, which helps them grow strong and shiny.
And because oftheir cooling and calming effect, they are excellent at calming stressedor sunburned skin and reviving puffy, dark under eyes – simply applyfresh sliced cucumber to soothe the affected area.
So whether you’re consuming cucumber or putting it on your face, the benefits are real, people.

After perfecting my Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac ‘n’ Cheese, I wanted to make an equally fastrecipe with a slight twist; one that involved vegan cream cheese. Because yum.
Who wouldn’t want cream cheese in their pasta? That’s what I wanna know.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish.
The base ingredients are gluten-free penne (I list my go-to brands below) and asparagus and mushrooms sautéed in garlic.
The star of the show, however, is the sauce.

This sauce is a simple blend of vegan cream cheese, garlic, almond milk, nutritional yeast, vegan parmesan cheese, lemon juice and red pepper flakes.
The result is an insanely creamy sauce that comes together in no time and has the perfect balance of “cheesiness” and spice. I think I’m in love.

Add pasta and cook according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.Lower heat on the skillet to low and add olive oil (2 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and minced garlic (4 cloves as original recipe is written). Sauté for 2-3 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside.To a blender add remaining raw minced garlic (2 cloves as original recipe is written), sautéed garlic (4 cloves as original recipe is written), vegan cream cheese, almond milk, vegan parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, red pepper flake, and another healthy pinch sea salt and black pepper.Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more vegan parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast for cheesiness, raw garlic for zing, red pepper flake for heat, lemon juice for acidity/brightness, or salt for saltiness. Mix once more and add back to skillet.Heat the sauce over medium heat to warm until slightly bubbly, then reduce heat to low to keep warm. Stir occasionally.Add cooked drained pasta directly to the sauce along with sautéed asparagus and mushrooms. Toss to coat and enjoy immediately with additional vegan parmesan cheese. Fresh parsley would also make a fresh, colorful garnish.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a bit of almond milk if it’s dried out."
376,Thai Spring Rolls with Cashew Dipping Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Thai Spring Rolls with Cashew Dipping Sauce

We’ve been on a Thai kick for, oh, the last 6 years or so. Clearly, our affection for thiscuisine is not going anywhere.
Our recent go-to has been Mango Curryand spring rolls of some kind. My favorite is the light and fresh “salad” rolls with crunchy vegetables and tofu.
This is my adaptation ofthat with a garlic cashew dipping sauce (oh hello, gorgeous) and my favorite vegetables at the moment.

Do you want to know the secret ingredient that makes these Thai Spring Rolls the best you’ll ever try? Fresh basil.
Boom. Drop the mic.
Fresh basil in spring rolls is something like magic. And when paired with tofu, crispy vegetables, and a savory-sweet dipping sauce, it’s all too much for my taste buds to handle. OK, clearly not, but it’s that good.
Not only in this recipe delicious, it comes together in about 30 minutes! I think we can all spare 30 minutes for a delicious meal or snack, eh?

The idea for adding radishes to the bottom of the rolls (so gorgeous!), came from Nutrition Stripped (genius!) If you haven’t tried that lady’s golden turmeric milk, by the way, you haven’t lived. Go do so now, please. It would make the perfect accompaniment to these rolls.

I hope you all love these spring rolls! They’re:
Fresh
Light
Healthy
Crunchy
Flavorful
Quick
Satisfying
&amp; Insanely tasty with my cashew dipping sauce
Make these spring rolls to serve alongside your favorite Thai entrées(like my Yellow Mango Curry or Creamy Thai Carrot Soup), or enjoy as a main dish! With the tofu and dipping sauce, they’re incredibly satisfying, and the veggies will leave you full for hours.

","Wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something slightly heavy on top - such as a saucepan - to begin ""pressing"" and drawing out excess moisture.In the meantime, prepare sauce by adding minced garlic, cashew butter, tamari, maple syrup, lime juice, and red pepper flake to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add hot water until you've reached a semi-thick sauce consistency.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime juice for acidity, red pepper flake for heat, tamari for saltiness, or maple syrup for sweetness. Set aside.Add clean, dry kale to a medium mixing bowl and top with sesame oil and tamari. Massage with hands to soften and infuse some flavor. This step is optional, but results in a more flavorful roll in my opinion.Prep remaining vegetables and cut tofu into rectangular strips (see photo). Arrange on a platter so they're easy to access. Also ready a cutting board by slightly dampening its surface - this is where you'll prepare your spring rolls.Pour very hot water into a wide shallow dish (I use a skillet) and let cool slightly. Then dip one spring roll wrapper in the water and let it soften for 10-12 seconds, until just pliable. If you let it set too long, the paper will get too sticky to work with.Use your hands to gently spread the wrapper onto your dampened work surface, making sure there aren't many creases. Then top with fillings in this order: radish, bell pepper, carrot, tofu, basil, kale. Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the fillings, firmly tucking them into each other, then fold the sides over the center, and continue rolling until the spring roll is seam side down.Place seam side down on a serving platter and set aside. Continue until all fillings are used up.Serve with cashew dipping sauce. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep stored separately for 2-3 days."
377,Refined-Sugar-Free Black Bean Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Refined-Sugar-Free Turtle Brownies (GF)

I remember the first time I trieda black bean brownie (circa 2012).
My eyes almost crossed I was so perplexed. I immediately thought, “Oh my goodness, this can’t be real.”
A brownie made with wholesome ingredients that tastes like the real thing? Sounds too good to be true, but believe me, it’s not.
Since sharing my original recipe on the blog, I’ve revamped the ingredients to ensureit’s completely naturally sweetened (!!!), while remaining entirely vegan and gluten free. Plus, I threwin a fewadd-ins for a fun flavor twist.
In other words, get your black beans, kids. We’re makin’ brownies (and we’re not telling anyone what’s in them).

This recipe is simple, requiring justa food processorto make! Yep, it all comes together in one “bowl,” making cleanup a breeze.
To makethese “turtle” brownies, I added date caramel, pecans, and chocolate chips. The coconut was just for fun, because obviously, delicious.
The result was a fudgy on the inside,tender on the outside, chocolate- and pecan- studded brownie that passes for the real thing. Try not immediately eating three – I dare you.

I think you guys will LOVE these brownies! They’re:
Fudgy
Rich
Tender
Moist
Studded with ooey-gooeytoppings
Quick
Easy
&amp; Insanely delicious
Make these for a party and I can almost guarantee no one will realize they’re made with black beans. They also freeze well, making them a great dessert to have around during the week – just pop one out and let it thaw. Top with coconut whipped cream or vanilla bean coconut ice cream if you’re feeling fancy. You can’t go wrong either way.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C), and lightly grease a 12-slot standard size muffin pan (not mini). Make sure you've rinsed and thoroughly drained your black beans at this point.Prepare flax eggs by combining flax and water in the bowl of the food processor. Pulse a couple times and then let rest for a few minutes.Add remaining ingredients (besides pecans, date caramel, coconut and chocolate chips) and puree - about 1-2 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. You want it pretty smooth.Add pecans, coconut and chocolate chips and pulse to combineAdd the batter to the prepared muffin tin (mine only filled 11) and smooth the tops with a spoon or your finger. Then add 1 tsp date caramel to each brownie and carefully swirl with a toothpick or knife.Top with remaining coconut, pecans, and chocolate chips. Then bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops are dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides of the tin. I found mine took about 29 minutes.Remove from oven and let cool for 20-30 minutes before removing from pan. They will be tender, so gently run a knife around the sides, and then lift out with a fork.The insides are meant to be fudgy, so don't be concerned if they seem too moist. Enjoy with additional date caramel (optional, if desired). They would also be delicious with Coconut Whipped Cream, or Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream!Store completely cooled leftovers in an airtight container for up to a few days. Will keep in the freezer up to 1 month."

Sloppy joes are so delicious! And I haven’t had them since my mom made them for me back in high school.My sister and I wouldreturn home from sports practice absolutely famished and we’d eat two open-faced sloppy joes with a side ofmac ‘n’ cheese.
Oh, how my diet has changed since then! But my craving for this sweet, savory, smoky sandwich has not. Let’s do this!

This recipe comes together in roughly 30 minutes, including cooking your lentils! It’s so simple and quick that it’s sure to become a weeknight staple in your home.
The ingredients are also simple. In fact, the only thingnot already in my pantry wasWorcestershire sauce (I include a vegan-friendly brand recommendation below, as well as a recipe idea if you can’t find any at thestore).
Easy recipes that you can make with everyday pantry items – that’s SO my thing.

As I write this post, I’m enjoying a bowl of this curry for lunch, and I can’t even tell you how delicious it is.
But for you, I will try.

This recipe was inspired by a new favorite takeout dishfrom one of our go-toThai restaurants in Portland (find our dining guide here!).
I’ve strayed from my usual Pad Thai and ventured into greener pastures. Or in this case, yellow curry pastures. And I don’t think there’s any turningback.
This recipe is simple, requiring just30 minutes and 1 pot, which makes it perfect for weeknight meals when you need something fast, delicious, and satisfying.

The base of this curry is garlic, ginger, serrano or Thai pepper, and shallot. Next comes red curry paste and plenty of turmeric and lemon juice for that intense yellow curry flavor and color.
Coconut milk addscreamy texture, coconut sugar sweetens the dish naturally, and red bell pepper, green peas, mango, and cashews are the delicious add-ins that make this dish insanely beautiful and filling.


I think you guys are going to LOVE this curry! It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Flavorful
Vegetable-heavy
Naturally sweetened
Perfectly spicy
&amp; Better than takeout (there I said it)
This curry is fabulous when you’re craving Thai food that’s quick and hearty. And becauseit’s so satisfying and flavorful, I think it would be especially great for hosting as it’ssure to pleaseeven the heartiest eaters.

","Heat a large cast iron or metal skillet with a high rim over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil, shallot, ginger, garlic, and pepper. Add a pinch of sea salt and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.Add cabbage (optional) and red curry paste and stir, and cook for 2 minutes more.Add coconut milk, coconut sugar, sea salt, tamari, turmeric and stir. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.Once simmering, add red pepper and peas (optional) and slightly reduce heat. You want a simmer, not a boil, which should be around low to medium-low heat.Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to soften the pepper and peas, and infuse them with curry flavor.At this time also taste and adjust the flavor of the broth as needed. I added more coconut sugar for sweetness, tamari and sea salt for saltiness, and turmeric for earthiness. You can also add more curry paste for more spice and intense curry flavor. Don't be shy with seasonings - this curry should be very flavorful.Once the broth is well seasoned and the peppers are softened, add mango, cashews and lemon juice, and simmer for 3-4 minutes more over low to medium-low heat.Serve over rice or coconut quinoa, or steamed broccoli (broccoli being my favorite). This dish gets elevated with the addition of more lemon juice and Thai or regular basil."

Authentic, baked, vegan, gluten-free cheesecake! And it tastes like real, true cheesecake (no lie)!
I’m so happy I could dance (and I totally did).


If you’ve followed the blog for a while now, you know I have a thing for cheesecake:
7-ingredient Vegan Cheesecake
Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake
No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecake
Pumpkin Cheesecake
White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecake
Hubba.
I love all of these recipes, but they’re all raw and leave me partially unsatisfied when I’m craving a real, true baked cheesecake.
I once ran a half marathon and then went straight to Cheesecake Factory and ate a giant slice of their white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake. SoTRUST ME. I think I knowwhat “real cheesecake” tastes like (and this is it!).

This recipe is not only delicious and insanely close to the ‘real thing,’ it’s also simple, requiring just a blender to make! Plus, there’s no water bath involved like a traditional cheesecake, simplifying the process even more.
In other words, this truly is an easy cheesecake that just also happens to be vegan, gluten-free,and refined-sugar-free.
Hello, thank you, I’m Dana, you’re welcome.

The base is an adaption of my new go-to almond-oat crust that ends up tasting very reminiscent of graham cracker crust!
And the filling is a mixture of cashews, coconut cream, and vegan cream cheese. I tested other varieties but found that this combination yields the absolute best texture and flavor.

I hope you all LOVE this cheesecake! It’s:
Insanely creamy
Perfectly sweet
Slightly citrusy + tangy
Rich
Satisfying
&amp; Like the real thing!
Make this cheesecake, because, well, you must! It would make a great one to have around for special events, like graduations, cookouts, bridal showers, baby showers…pretty much every occasion you can think of.
The best part isit’s baked, so it can sit out at room temperature for hourswithout melting like frozen, raw cheesecakes. Another win!

","Add raw cashews to a mixing bowl and cover with boiling hot water. Let rest for 1 hour (uncovered). Then drain thoroughly.In the meantime, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a standard loaf pan (or 8x8 inch baking dish // adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size) with parchment paper. Set aside.Add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a high speed blender and mix on high until a fine meal is achieved.Remove lid and add melted coconut oil, starting with 4 Tbsp (60 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and adding more if it's too dry. Pulse/mix on low until a loose dough is formed, scraping down sides as needed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil.Transfer mixture to parchment-lined loaf pan and spread evenly to distribute. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, like a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed. Let it come up the sides a little, otherwise it can be too thick on the bottom.Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-10 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly, then reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (162 C).Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to a high speed blender with coconut cream, vegan cream cheese, arrowroot starch, vanilla, maple syrup, coconut oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sea salt. Blend on high until very creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, lemon zest for tartness, salt for flavor balance, and maple syrup for sweetness.Pour filling over the pre-baked crust and spread into an even layer. Tap on counter to remove air bubbles.Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges look very slightly dry and the center appears only slightly “jiggly” but not liquidy. When you shake it, it will have some give to it, but it shouldn't all look liquid - only the center should jiggle.Let rest for 10 minutes at room temperature, then transfer to refrigerator to let cool completely (uncovered). Once cooled, cover (waiting until cool will prevent condensation) and continue refrigerating for a total of 5-6 hours, preferably overnight.To serve, lift out of pan with parchment paper and cut into bars or triangles. (I carefully cut off the very end pieces because they weren't as creamy as the center pieces.)Enjoy as is or with coconut whipped cream and fresh berries. Store leftovers in the refrigerator, covered, up to 3-4 days, though best within the first 2 days."
381,The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac 'n' Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac ‘n’ Cheese

We recently hosted a friend’s birthday party at our place and much to my surprise (and delight), they servedour Garlic Mac ‘n’ Cheese as one of the entrées.
But here’s the thing: They made it completely gluten-free, and somehow, it tasted better than mine. Don’t you hate it when somebody does you better than you?
Not me. I kind of love it. I learned something new!
With afew simple swaps, I knew I’d stumbled upon what truly is thee best vegan, gluten-free mac ‘n’ cheese and I couldn’t help but share. Let’s do this!

This recipe is above all, simple. It comes together in about 1 hour (including roasting the garlic), and requires 8 simple ingredients.
I’ve been eating mostly gluten-free lately, and in doing so I’ve discovered the pasta brand Bionaturae, whichI’m completely smitten with.
Their penne tastes exactly like “real” gluten penne and doesn’t get gummy or have any weird taste! It truly does pass as the real deal.

The other news to report is arrowroot starch. I’ve been using arrowroot – a natural thickener – in things like my Vegan Lemon Curd to thicken sauces, but when I tried it in pasta sauce, the results were unreal.
Are you guys seeing this? When you begin heating the sauce back up on the stovetop, it gets super thick and a little “stringy” like real cheese!It’s a Christmas miracle (in spring, no less).

The sauce is a classic roux, with the exception of the arrowroot starch, and olive oil in place of the butter. Itgets its flavor from vegan parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, and fresh and roasted garlic.
The result is mac ‘n’ cheese perfection – no lie.

I hopeyou guys LOVE this pasta! It’s:
Ultra creamy
Super cheesy
Savory
Comforting
Satisfying
Simple
&amp; Seriously the best
Make this when you want to impress friends with an undetectably vegan and gluten-free pasta! It makes a great weeknight meal or one to save for weekend indulging. Our friends added sautéed kale when adding the pasta, which I loved! Definitely feel free to add in greens of choice for more nutritional benefits.

","To roast garlic, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cut off the very top of a head of garlic. Drizzle the top with a bit of oil, a sprinkle of salt and loosely wrap in foil.Place directly on oven rack and roast for 45 minutes - 1 hour, depending on size of garlic. You'll know it's done when the garlic is very fragrant and the bulb is golden brown. Remove from oven, slightly unwrap, and let cool.At the 40-minute mark, bring roughly 10 cups (2400 ml // use more or less if altering batch size) water to a boil in a large pot and salt generously. Once boiling, add pasta and stir to prevent noodles from sticking. Cook according to package instructions (usually about 8-10 minutes). Once fully cooked, drain and set aside.In the meantime, begin preparing sauce. Heat a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and minced fresh garlic. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until light golden brown. Immediately add arrowroot starch and whisk - cook for 1 minute.Slowly add almond milk while whisking, then cook for 2 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently. The sauce will likely look a little clumpy - that’s OK! We’re going to blend it.Transfer mixture to a blender, along with the roasted garlic. To extract garlic, simply push up from the base and the softened cloves should come right out - so gratifying (and delicious).Next add salt and pepper, nutritional yeast, and vegan parmesan cheese and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed - you want it pretty well salted + cheesy, so don't be shy with the nutritional yeast, salt, and vegan parmesan cheese.Return sauce back to skillet from earlier and cook over low heat until warmed and slightly thickened - about 2-3 minutes - whisking occasionally. As it warms back up, it will thicken and get super cheesy (see photo). For a thicker sauce, leave it as is. To thin slightly, add almond milk 1 Tbsp at a time until desired consistency is achieved. Turn off heat if it starts bubbling too aggressively.Add cooked, drained pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Then top with 1 more Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Optional: Heat oven to high broil and position a rack at the top of the oven. Broil pasta on high for 1-2 minutes (optional), or until golden brown (see photo). Watch closely as it can burn quickly.Serve immediately. I love topping mine with an extra pinch of vegan parmesan cheese - I can never get enough of that stuff.Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop - add extra almond milk if it's dry."

In the colder months, you can typically find me bundledin a sweater, holed up inside, hoping for spring to arrive. Now that it’s officially here (at least in the Pacific Northwest), I’m absolutely thrilled.
This is the time of year to get outside for my exercise, sit on patios, soak in the sun, and transition my diet to lighter foods instead of the hearty comfort dishes my body craves all winter.
Let’s kick off the new season with a salad, shall we?

This salad was inspired by one that Itried while we were in San Diego. Though myinterpretation of it is quite different, the main elements remain: lots of ginger, super crunchy vegetables, and tons of flavor.
This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare. And it’s full of good-for-you ingredients like kale, green beans, red pepper, cashews, sesame seeds, and carrots.

The dressing is cashew butter-based – a recent favorite of mine! Plus, I’ve recognized that not everyone can enjoy peanuts (sad, sad day) and it’s fun to switch it up sometimes.
The result is a super creamy dressing infused with tamari (or soy sauce), lime juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, and sesame oil for a slightly nutty flavor.

I hope you all love this salad! It’s:
Hearty
Crunchy
Vegetable-packed
Easy to make
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Perfect for spring
Makethis salad when you’re craving something healthy yet filling for dinner. It’s ideal for preparingahead of time and bringing along to work or running errands (justkeep the dressing separate so the greens remain crunchy and fresh). I also think it would pair well with my Thai Iced Tea and Creamy ThaiCarrot Soup with Basil.

383,Vegan Lemon Curd | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Lemon Curd

A few weeks ago, we had a brunch with some friends and lemon curd was on the table.
Lemon curd is sodelicious, but it’s sonot vegan-friendly. So I set off to make my own inspired version.

This 1-pot, 5-ingredient vegan lemon curd is like the real deal, and it’s delicious enough to eat right from the jar with a spoon – the sign of any good dessert.
It’s also naturally sweetened and requires just 30 minutes hands-on prep time before going into the refrigerator to set and thicken.

The key to any good lemon curd is a ton of lemon zest and fresh lemon juice.
The creative part came with the base ingredients. And for that I went with coconut cream for rich, creamy texture, and arrowroot starch to thicken. To sweeten naturally, I went with a little maple syrup. Oh man, so good.
I imagine this would work well with lime juice and zest, too!


This curd is the real deal. It is slightly more white in color because there are no eggs, but the lemon flavor is 100% there.
I hope you love this curd! It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Thick
Lemony
Tart
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Seriously delicious
I was so pleasantly surprised at the way this curd turned out! The coconut flavor is minimal (to none), the lemon really shines through, and it’s not too sweet.
If you’re like me, you’ll want to enjoy this straight out of the jar, pudding style. But it also makes a delicious topping for waffles, pancakesand baked goods, like these Lemon Muffins!

","Place coconut cream and lemon zest in a small saucepan and whisk to combine.Add lemon juice and arrowroot starch to a small mixing bowl and whisk to thoroughly dissolve. Then add to coconut cream mixture and stir.Lastly, add maple syrup (starting with lesser amount // 1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and whisk again until well combined.Place saucepan over medium heat and bring to a low bubble – not boil – whisking often. Once it starts bubbling and getting thick, reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until a visible ribbon forms when spooning a bit of the curd across the top. It should be thick and kind of jiggly in texture. During this process switch to a rubber spatula for stirring to ensure the curd isn’t sticking to the bottom or sides of the pan.Remove from heat and taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon zest for acidity/brightness, or maple syrup for sweetness.Let rest for 15 minutes, then whisk once more and transfer to a glass bowl or jar (I prefer these) and cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic wrap touches the curd – otherwise a film may form.Refrigerate for 5-6 hours, or overnight, or until completely chilled and set. Will keep in the refrigerator 7-10 days, though best within the first 4-5 days.This is so delicious you can eat it straight, but it makes an especially delicious topping for muffins, pancakes, waffles and other baked goods."
384,Kale White Bean Artichoke Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Kale &amp; White Bean Artichoke Dip

I am a dip kind of girl.
Give me a bag of chips and any dip in sight and I’ll call it dinner.
And when said dip has good-for-you ingredients like white beans and kale, I’m all in.
Let’s do this.

This 10-ingredient dip is inspired by my Creamy Spinach &amp; Kale Dip, and loosely adapted from a recipe in our upcoming print cookbook!
The sauceis made with cashews, vegan cream cheese, and nutritional yeast – which adds a healthy serving of vitamin B12.
Garlic adds zest, while kale adds a punch of green color, fiber, and plenty of nutrients.
Lastly, white beans addeven more creaminess to the dish, as well as fiber and plant-based protein.

Artichokes are often overlooked in the food world, in my opinion.
While preparing them whole can be a little intimidatingand time consuming, canned artichoke hearts are easy to use, and they make such a delicious addition to creamy dips, salads, and pastas.
Plus, they’re loaded with antioxidants and are especially high in fiber, among other benefits.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this dip! It’s:
Insanely creamy
Rich
Cheesy
Loaded with healthy ingredients
Fiber- + protein-rich
Easy
Fast
&amp; Delicious
This dip would make the perfect side or appetizer to bring along to parties or when hosting. It can be made ahead of time and warmed up in the oven to save time. If you’re trying to imagine the flavor, it’s kind of like spinach and artichoke dip but better (!!) thanks tothe addition of kale, white beans, and nutritional yeast. It’s so creamy and cheesy – I’m hooked!
What to dip with? Great question. My first choice is always tortilla chips, but it’s also great with toasted baguette, crackers, or veggies.

385,Crispy Hash Brown Haystacks | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Hash Brown Haystacks

What’s better than breakfast? Brunch. (There, I said it.)
Specificallywhen potatoes are involved.
These “haystacks” were inspired by my love for hash browns and my laziness to stand over the stove and actually cook them.
I packed them into muffin tins, watched Youtube for 30 minutes, and voila! Crispy, savory, perfecthash browns for you and for me.
All is right in the land again, friends. Let’s make some spuds.

This recipe requires just 7 ingredients,and comes together in less than 1 hour.
Can I share my secret for shredding potatoes in 1 minute? The grater attachment on the food processor. It is a revelation.
DO IT. You’ll never shy away from hash browns and veggie slaws again (nor should you).

To bring some sweetness and freshness to the game, I included corn and fresh parsley.
And for binding and moisture, I opted for cornstarch and a little melted vegan butter (which can be subbed for another oil of your choice).
The result was perfectly browned hash browns that were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and beggingto be dunked in hot sauce and stuffed in your mouth (or served alongside your favorite breakfast scramble).

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Also generously grease a standard muffin tin with oil of choice, otherwise the potatoes will stick.Add finely grated potatoes (see notes for my go-to method) to a large mixing bowl with shallot, parsley, corn, melted vegan butter, cornstarch, salt and pepper and stir to thoroughly combine.Divide mixture evenly between 12 muffin tins (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), filling each tin with about 1/4 cup of the potato mixture. Press down gently to form. Sprinkle the tops with a pinch more salt and pepper and bake for 20 minutes.At the 20-minute mark, increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (218 C) and bake for 10-12 minutes more, or until the tops appear golden brown, and the edges are dark golden brown.Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes, then loosen the sides with a butter knife and gently lift out with a fork. Serve immediately as is or with hot sauce. These are especially great alongside tofu scrambles (see my favorite three scrambles: here, here, and here).Best when fresh. To freeze, arrange baked haystacks in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until firm. Then store in a freezer-safe container up to 3-4 weeks. Reheat in the microwave or a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until completely warmed through."
386,Golden Milk Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Golden Milk Ice Cream

I have a new obsession and it’s not chocolate. What’s happening?!

As I mentionedin our Best of February post, I am absolutely smitten with golden milk at the moment, also known as turmeric milk.
I originally became intrigued after seeing it on one of my favorite vlogger’s channels, and then I scouted this recipe from Nutrition Stripped and have been making it nearly every day since.
It makes an excellent substitute to morning coffee if you’re trying to cut back on caffeine (like me) in the afternoon when you need something to tide you over till dinner or in the evening to warm uporsatisfy a sweet tooth.
I’m so into it, in fact, I recentlybrought some in a tea thermos along to the movies and I couldn’t have been happier (or warmer) sipping my golden milk during the film. Plus (!), no concession stand temptations –problem solved.

The base of this gorgeous,8-ingredientice cream is full-fat coconut milk for extra creamy texture.
Ground turmeric, cinnamon, fresh ginger, black pepper, and cardamomaddwarm and comforting spice. And it’s sweetened naturally with maple syrup to offset the spices and make it truly dessert-worthy.
All that’s left to do ischill, churn, throw in some candied ginger (optional), and you’re in golden milk ice cream heaven.

So what’s the big deal about golden milk? It’s SO healthy for you.
The star of the show is turmeric, which hasmedicinal properties and is most wellknown for its anti-inflammatory effects. If you’re feeling sick or sore, or just not like yourself, this is the spice for you.
In addition to turmeric you have:
Cinnamon – which stabilizes blood sugar
Ginger – an anti-inflammatory that also supports digestion
And coconut milk – which provides a healthyfat source
You might as well reap some health benefits while indulging your sweet tooth.

This ice cream is so dreamy. It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Coconutty
Super colorful
Warmly spiced
Perfectly (+ naturally) sweet
Healthy
Comforting
&amp; Unexpectedly delicious
Make this ice cream to wow guests, or to have on hand when you are craving golden milk but want it in creamy, frozen form. Mmmm – yes please. This would also make a great milkshake when mixed with almond or coconut milk.

","The day or night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill (see notes if you don't have an ice cream maker). Also, add coconut milk, fresh ginger, maple syrup, sea salt, turmeric, cinnamon, pepper, and cardamom (optional) to a large saucepan and heat over medium heat.Bring to a simmer (not a boil), whisking to thoroughly combine ingredients. Then, remove from heat and add vanilla extract. Whisk once more to combine.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding in more turmeric for intense turmeric flavor, cinnamon for warmth, maple syrup for sweetness, or salt to balance the flavors.Transfer mixture (including the whole ginger slices) to a mixing bowl and let cool to room temperature. Then cover and chill in refrigerator overnight, or for at least 4-6 hours.The following day, use a spoon (or strainer) to remove the ginger. At this time, you can also add olive oil for extra creaminess by whisking in thoroughly to combine (optional).Add to ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 20-30 minutes. It should look like soft serve.While it's churning, chop up your candied ginger (optional). In the last few minutes of churning, add in the ginger to incorporate.Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a large freezer-safe container (such as a parchment-lined loaf pan) and use a spoon to smooth the top.Cover securely and freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm. Set out for 10 minutes before serving to soften, and use a hot ice cream scoop (warmed in hot water) to ease scooping.Will keep in the freezer for up to 10 days or more, though best within the first 7 days. Enjoy this as a lighter dessert with some serious health benefits!"
387,Easy Vegan Kimchi | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Kimchi

This post was supposed to be brownies. Allow me to explain…


Maybe I should start by saying that this weekis John’s birthday (!!!) and last year around this time, I posted raw brownies – his most despised food on Earth.
Not as in, ‘No, thanks. I’ll pass on the brownie,’ but ‘If you don’t get that brownie away from me, I might get sick.’
This year, I thought I’d post something that he actually liked: Kimchi.

Kimchi is a little complicated if you make it in anywhere close to the traditional way. Atminimum, it’sa bittime intensive (depending on how long you ferment).
ButI did my best to keep this recipe simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredientsthat you should haveeasy access to.
I included more photos than normal to demonstrate the step-by-step process, which hopefully helps when you tackle this recipe yourself!
If you like kimchi, you have to try this vegan version that really is quite easyto master even though it takes longer than most (read: all) of my recipes.

How spicy do you like your kimchi? That will determine how much red chili flake you put in your sauce.
You can likely find more “authentic” Korean red chili flakes at a Korean or Asian market, but I just went with standard red pepper flakes you can get at most grocery stores and it turned out great!
We’re spice-lovers, so I added an entire 1/2 cup (YES 1/2 cup) to my sauce, but feel free to scale it back if you walk on the milder side.

The primary hands-on part of this recipe is the cabbage, which you salt to soften and draw outmoisture and flip every 30 minutes for a couple hours while you prep the other ingredients. It’s quite a therapeutic process, which can happenin the background while you do other things.
One warning though? It makes whatever space it’s fermenting in smell like kimchi. You have been warned.

I hope you guys LOVE this kimchi! It’s:
Spicy
Tangy
Crunchy
Super healthy
Fragrant
&amp; Delicious
If you’re like us, you can find an excuse to put kimchi on anything. Think: Breakfast scrambles, brown rice and sautéed veggie bowls at lunch, or stir-fries at dinner.
Because it’s fermented, kimchi provides plenty of microorganisms that promotea healthy gut, can help reduce inflammation, and even improve digestion (just to name a few).
If you give this recipe a try, let us know! Leave a comment it, rate it, and be sure to tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see your kimchi in action. Cheers, friends!

","Make sure that you are using clean surfaces and utensils and are washing your hands throughout the process of preparing your kimchi in order to prevent introducing bad bacteria and disrupting the fermentation process. The photos provide step-by-step instructions, so if you get lost, refer back to those.Start by quartering your well-rinsed and dried cabbage (savoy or napa) and carefully removing the bottom core (hard white section) with a sharp knife. Discard.Next place your cabbage in a large mixing bowl and begin packing a generous amount of sea salt in between each of the leaves. Do so by lifting each individual leaf and sprinkling with sea salt. Repeat until all leaves have been salted. Then press down and let rest for 30 minutes. This softens and breaks down the cabbage, drawing out moisture, priming it to be coated in the sauce.While your cabbage rests, prepare your vegan fish sauce by adding all ingredients to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Set aside.Next, prepare your chili sauce by adding fresh ginger, garlic, onion and red chili flake to a food processor or blender. I started with 1/2 cup chili flake and found it to be quite spicy (as I prefer). So if you desire less heat, start at 3-4 Tbsp and work your way up (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Taste and adjust flavor as needed.Add vegan fish sauce to this mixture and pulse to combine. Set aside.At this time, your cabbage should be ready to flip. Wash your hands and turn each section of cabbage over so it's facing the opposite direction. Then pack down with hands to compress. You'll repeat this process 3 more times (for a total of 4 times), waiting 30 minutes in between, and washing hands before touching cabbage.In the meantime, add your chopped carrots and green onion (optional) to a medium mixing bowl, along with the sauce. Stir to combine, then cover and set aside.While waiting, this is a good time to sterilize your storage containers. Bring a pot of water to a boil and place your containers (I used 1 large mason jar, and 1 small glass container // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), in a clean sink and pour the boiling water over top. Let containers cool slightly, then dry with a clean towel and set aside.Once you have flipped your cabbage 4 times (it should be tender and shrunken down quite a bit), it's time to rinse. In very cold water, rinse each section of cabbage to remove excess salt, then place on 2-3 absorbent clean towels and pat dry. Also separate the cabbage leaves at this time, so they're easier to work with.Rinse and dry the mixing bowl the cabbage was in, then return the dried cabbage to the bowl. Get your sauce with carrots and green onions and begin coating each leaf with the sauce. If you have gloves (disposable or rubber), use them at this time as the sauce can irritate sensitive hands (I didn't, but thought it was worth mentioning).Be generous when coating, but also keep in mind you need enough sauce to coat all of the cabbage. Once the cabbage is thoroughly coated with sauce, wash hands and get your sterilized storage container(s).With clean hands, begin placing the coated cabbage leaves in the container, packing down to ensure there is as little air as possible between leaves. Continue until all cabbage is packed in, then press down very firmly to remove air. Top with clean, sterilized lid, and set in a cool dark place (such as a cabinet, not the refrigerator) to ferment.How long to ferment is up to you. The resource I used suggested 36 hours minimum, then transfer to the refrigerator for 1 week to ferment longer. I fermented mine for about 48 hours, but next time I think I'll do 1 week for softer cabbage and a more intense fermented flavor.The longer you ferment the kimchi, the tangier and intense the flavor will be, and the more tender the cabbage will become. From what I've read, I wouldn't ferment for more than 21 days.Each day it ferments, open up and press down with a clean utensil, such as a spoon, to press out air bubbles and ensure the kimchi is immersed in liquid. A good sign of proper fermentation is seeing little bubbles in the sauce when you press down.A good indicator of when it's done fermenting is the smell. If it smells pleasant to the nose and tangy, like the kimchi you're used to trying, it's probably ready to transfer to the refrigerator.Kimchi will keep in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 weeks, and even months. You'll know it's gone bad if mold has formed or the smell is sour or unpleasant.How to enjoy kimchi?! This makes a great addition or side to any Asian dish, such as Easy Vegan Fried Rice, Vietnamese Spring Rolls, or General Tso's Tofu Stir Fry."
388,Banana & Berry Hemp Seed Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banana &amp; Berry Hemp Seed Pudding

This is another dishinspired by our time in Oslo, Norway.
For only spending 24 hours there, I’m still a little perplexed as tohow I managed to gaintwo completely differentideas for the blog. I’m not complaining, and neither are my taste buds. Let’s make some simple, healthy dessert, shall we?

When we’re traveling, it’s oftendifficult to find anything sweet outside of dairy-free chocolate at the grocery store. So when we stumbled upon alocal cafe that had some vegan options, I was thrilled.
Because of the language gap, I wasn’t quite sure what I was ordering. But I knew it was “dairy-free” and a “pudding” and it had “berries.” Good enough for me.
This recipe is quite basic and simple, requiring just 6 ingredients and 1 bowl (food processor).
The idea is simple: Kind of like a thicker banana berry-based smoothie with hemp seeds and chia seeds.The result is a naturally-sweet “pudding” that’s perfect for snacking or alighter dessert.
It almost goes without saying, but this dessert is packed with free-radical fighting antioxidants thanks to the berries, potassium from the bananas, Omega 3 fatty acids and protein from the chia seeds, and all 20 amino acids (including the 9 amino acids our bodies can’t produce) from the hemp seeds. Thanks hemp seeds!
Oh, and cinnamon helps stabilizeblood sugar levels. Thanks cinnamon!

I hope you all love this pudding! It’s:
Creamy
Cool
Naturallysweet
Loaded with healthy ingredients
Easy to make
&amp; Satisfying
This is the perfect treat to have around when you need something quick for breakfast or a snack or you’re craving a healthierdessert. I enjoyed mine after dishing on some chana masala and it was the perfect sweet ending to my night.

","Add bananas, berries, and coconut milk to a food processor and mix to combine. Then taste and adjust sweetness if needed, adding either maple syrup or pitted dates (optional) and blending to combine.Next, add hemp seeds, chia seeds, and cinnamon (see photo), and pulse to combine.

It doesn’t get much better than a candy bar coated in peanuts and caramel and dunked in chocolate. I mean, wow. Unless, that is, you turnit into anIce Cream Snickers Bar. Like, whoa.
As you might’ve guessed, it was only a matter of time before I smooshed together my love for Snickers and cheesecake.
The results? Totally drool-worthy, and it all happens with just 10 simple ingredients.

This cheesecake begins with my go-to date-walnut crust. Dates, walnuts, and sea salt whirled together to create a tender, naturally sweetened base for our cheesecake.

While the crust sets in the freezer, it’s time to move on to the1-ingredient date caramel. ONE INGREDIENT, people. It’s magic.
Simply add dates into a food processor and thin with a little hot water. Voila – we have a caramel ribbon ready to swirl through our cheesecake.


Next comes roasted salted peanuts for that salty-sweet flavor contrast and added crunch. Swoon.

The hard part is waiting for it all to set in the freezer for about 4-6 hours. Butit’s so worth the wait.
Patience, my friend.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this cheesecake! It’s:
Rich
Salty-sweet
Creamyin the center
Crunchy on top
Chocolaty
Caramel-y
Peanut-y
&amp; Delicious
This would make the perfect dessert for a weekend treat or to celebrate special occasions (you know, like Tuesday). It’s naturally sweetened, insanely rich, and truly reminiscent of a Snickers bar.

","Add cashews to a bowl and cover with boiling hot water. Let set, uncovered, for 1 hour. Then drain thoroughly. Also line an 8x8-inch baking dish* with parchment paper. Set aside.In the meantime, make crust by adding dates to a food processor. Blend/mix until small bits remain or it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Add walnuts and sea salt to the food processor and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more walnuts.Press the crust into the parchment-lined dish (see photo), until uniformly flat. I like to lay parchment paper on top and then press down with something flat - like a liquid measuring cup - and press down so it's firmly packed. Set crust in freezer to set.Next make date caramel by adding 3/4 cup dates (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to the food processor. Blend until a paste forms, then add hot water a little at a time until it forms a nice caramel-like paste that's spreadable. Try not to add more than 3-4 Tbsp (45-60 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), which will depend on the freshness of your dates. Set aside.Add your drained, soaked cashews to a high speed blender, along with vanilla (optional), maple syrup, coconut milk, sea salt, oil, and lemon juice. Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon for brightness, salt for flavor balance, or maple syrup for sweetness.Pour filling over the crust and tap on the counter to release any air bubbles. Then add half of the date caramel in small spoonfuls and swirl with a toothpick or chopstick (see photo).Sprinkle the peanuts on top and tap once again so they gently sink in. Cover lightly with plastic wrap, and then seal the top with foil. Freeze for 4-6 hours, or until completely set and firm.When ready to serve, set out cheesecake (to thaw briefly) and top with remaining date paste and a few more roasted peanuts (optional).In the meantime, prepare chocolate sauce. Add chocolate and coconut oil (optional) to a ceramic bowl and set over a small saucepan with 1 inch simmering water (over medium heat). Stir occasionally over the simmering water until melted (alternatively, melt in the microwave in 30 second increments).Drizzle the chocolate over the cheesecake, slice into 9 to 12 bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and serve.Enjoy immediately.

390,1-Pot Red Lentil Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Red Lentil Chili

Sometimes inspiration comes from the most unexpectedplaces.
I posted this picture on Instagram a few weeks ago (for my Red Lentil Curry), and someone asked if it was red lentil chili. “No, but GOOD IDEA,” I replied.
The rest is history. I couldn’t shake the thought from my mind.

This chili comes just in time for theselast few wintry days before spring arrives (at least here in the Pacific Northwest).
It’s simple, requiring just 1 pot, basicingredients, and comes together in less than 1 hour.

I’ve been inspired by some Indian cooking methods I’ve been researchinglately involving a mortar and pestle. Instead of just mincing or chopping your vegetables, spices, and herbs, you grind them together so their flavor is more intense and more evenly distributed throughout the dish.
Of course, if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use a small food processor or just finely mince. I just lovethis method, and now that I’ve discovered it, I can’t stop!

In addition to red lentils–which are full of fiber, protein, folate, and magnesium (just to name a few) – I also included black beans (another great source of folate and fiber) and kidney beans (which are especially high in iron and vitamin B1).
This isn’t one of those soup-like chilis that’s mostly tomatoes. This is chock full of lentils, beans, and corn, and is thick and stew-like in texture – my favorite.

I hope you love this chili! It’s:
Hearty
Smoky
Flavorful
Not too spicy
Healthy
Comforting
Satisfying
&amp; Simple
Make this dish for a crowd, as it’s especially great for hosting. Or make a batch over the weekendand enjoyit for lunch throughout the week.

","Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, and red pepper. Season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.Add jalapeño and garlic to a mortar and pestle and crush into a rough paste (alternatively, blend in a small food processor, or finely mince). Add to the pot with onion and red pepper, and season with another pinch salt and pepper.Add 2/3 of the chili powder (2 Tbsp as original recipe is written), half of the cumin (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written), paprika, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and water, and stir to combine. Bring to a low boil over medium high heat.Once boiling, add lentils and reduce heat to medium-low or low, so it's at a gentle simmer. You want to see bubbles, but you don't want it boiling. Cook for 15 minutes, or until lentils are mostly tender. As it's cooking you may need to add more water if the mixture is looking too dry and the lentils aren't submerged (I didn't find that necessary).Next add kidney beans, black beans, 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper, and remaining cumin (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and chili powder (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written), and stir to combine.Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or medium-low), add corn (optional), cover, and gently simmer for 20 minutes to meld the flavors together. Stir occasionally.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more chili powder or cumin for smokiness, salt for saltiness, or a little coconut sugar to balance the heat and draw out the other flavors.Serve as is, or garnished with chili cheese fritos, fresh jalapeño, cilantro, red onion, and/or avocado (optional).Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4 days, and in the freezer up to 1 month.

391,Easy Chana Masala | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Chana Masala

Traveling. Why do we travel?
It’s so challenging and tiring and I constantly have to manage my expectations before we ever get there. And especially when we arrive (like when we show up in Croatia and it’s cold and windyand loud) and I getsick.
That sounded negative. But no,it’s honesty. If you haven’t noticed, even though traveling is hard sometimes, we stilllove it,travel often, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to do so. In fact, we’re hopeful to spend more time traveling this year and I cannot wait.
Despite its challenges, traveling does one big thing for me: It inspires. Pretty much every meal we sit down to is an opportunity to learn about a new culture. How wonderful.

This recipe was inspired by a meal we stumbled upon in Oslo, Norway.Despite it being quite cold and windy and the shops being closed because it was a Sunday (manage expectations, Dana, manage expectations…), we found this amazing Indian restaurant where I enjoyedone of the best meals I’ve ever had.
Yes, big claims! And it’s all because of their chana masala (and mango chutney…oh my word).

Chana masala is traditionally based with green chilies, onion, garlic, fresh cilantro, a blend of spices, chickpeas, and tomatoes. It can be prepareda number of different ways, but I chose the simple route: 1 pot and about30 minutes required.

It startswith onion and cumin. Next comes a paste of green chilis, ginger, garlic, and fresh cilantro. The bulk of the flavor comes from coriander, chili powder, and ground turmeric. Chickpeas add plenty of fiber, texture, and protein, and puréed tomatoes add body and richness.
The magical step that takes this dish from love it toGIVE ME ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW is the garam masala (I include a simple DIY blend below), and fresh lemon juice.

The result is a thick, stew-like curry that’s extremely flavorful, easy to make, not overly spicy, and the perfect hearty plant-based meal.
Enjoy this dishon its own, over rice, cauliflower rice, or – my personal favorite – over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (easy recipe below). I know, it sounds weird, but it’s SO good, and another way to get more plants into your diet.

","Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground black pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a powder. Set aside.When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of coconut sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then let cool slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or cauliflower rice. Lastly, my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (see notes for instructions).Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month."

Friends, this is a real thing, and it’s happening right now.
If you aren’t a PB&amp;J fan, look away. But if you are (and who isn’t?), this is the chia pudding for you.
Ready your breakfast spoons.

I’ve been snapchatting more recently (username: minimalistbaker). Have you been following along?
If so, you know I’m in the best kind of breakfast rut right now: steel-cut oats with peanut butter, toasted almonds, and a simple blueberry compote.
Several of you asked me for the recipe. And because I’m a tease (and I think oats are so easy!), I thought I’d take that concept and turn it into something more exciting.
Because, like, have you seen chia pudding? Talk about eye candy!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 basicingredients and 30 minutes prep time (plus chilling). The magic happens in the fridge where it gels up and turns into a pudding-like consistency.
Why chia seeds? So cooland so healthy.
Cool because they absorb 10 times their weight and water and turn just about anythingthey’re added to into a magical pudding or gel. They can also be subbed for flaxseed in a flax egg. It’s like kitchen science.
And healthy because they’re rich inOmega 3 and 6 fatty acids, fiber, protein, and calcium (just to name a few).

This PB&amp;J chia seed pudding is simple in concept and so easy to make.
The base is a blueberry compote made with wild blueberries, orange juice, and chia seeds.
And the chia pudding is made with almond and coconut milk, peanut butter, a little maple syrup, vanilla, and chia seeds.
Add another spoonful ofpeanut butter and a few fresh blueberries on topand you have a breakfast or snack that’s seriously healthy for you, yet tastes like dessert.

I hope you all love this chia pudding! It’s:
Creamy
Peanut buttery
Berry-packed
Perfectly sweet
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Insanely delicious
This recipe yields aboutthree servings, making it perfect for preparing ahead of time and and enjoying throughout the week. It would also make a healthy snack or dessert for kids, because even picky eaters love PB&amp;J.

","To a small skillet or saucepan, add the blueberries and orange juice. Warm over medium-high heat until bubbling. Then lower heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes - stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and add chia seeds. Stir to combine.Divide the compote between three (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) small serving dishes (like these from Weck), and set in the refrigerator to chill.In the meantime, add almond and coconut milk to a blender, along with vanilla (optional), maple syrup, and peanut butter. Blend on high to fully combine. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness or peanut butter for saltiness.Add chia seeds and pulse a few times to incorporate, being careful not to blend as you want the chia seeds left whole.Transfer to a liquid measuring cup or jar (or just set your whole blender in the fridge), and set in the fridge to begin chilling.Wait 10 minutes for the chia compote to cool. Then remove the chia pudding and compote from the refrigerator. Give the chia pudding a stir to redistribute the chia seeds, then divide between the three serving dishes right on top of the compote.Cover well and set in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1-2 hours (preferably overnight), or until chilled through and pudding-like in consistency.To serve, top with extra peanut butter and fresh blueberries (optional). Will keep covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days."

I have a thing for Indian food (see Spicy Red Lentil Curry,Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Green Chickpea Curry with Couscous, 30-minute Coconut Curry, andSamosa Potato Cakes.)
The obsessionlives on, and I have another treat for you guys:A 30-minute curried beet soup with crispy tandoori-roasted chickpeas. You in?

There’s an Indian restaurant in Portland called Bollywood Theaterthat’s quite sensational.
They serve a roasted beet dishcooked incoconut milk and curry leaves. Mmm. So many people had raved about them I had to try them myself.
The bad news: While the flavor and concept was there, the texture wasn’t what I was hoping for.
The good news:I made my very own inspired version at home and turned it into soup. Spoiler alert: Mine (in my opinion) is better than the original concept (just sayin’).

This soupis simple, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish. It’s also vegan, gluten free, and loaded with health benefits.
Beetsare rich in iron, fiber, folate, vitamin C, and potassium. They’re also a natural anti-inflammatory, are loaded with disease-fighting phytonutrients, and help the body detoxify.
Coconut milk not only provides a creamy base to this soup, italso boastshealthy doses of B vitamins and vitamin C, as well as iron, selenium, and calcium.
Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory andpain reducer. It’salso proven to helpsettle an upset stomach and also improvesdigestive function. Also, delicious.
Garlic also acts as an anti-inflammatory in the body, and is a great source of vitamin C, B6, manganese, and selenium. Somehow, italso contains compounds thathelp regulate our blood pressure. I know, it’s magic.


While your soup is cooking, roast your chickpeas. I toss mine in a simple mixture of salt, coconut sugar, and my go-to tandoori masala spice blend, which you can find at spice markets and grocery stores like Whole Foods.
The result is a tender chickpea with a slightly crispy edge and a rich, smoky, subtlyspicy flavor – perfect for topping this soup.

I hope you all love this soup! It’s:
Creamy
Comforting
Curry-spiced
Hearty
Earthy
Healthy
&amp; Quick
If you have an abundance of beets in your pantry, this is the recipefor you. This soup is perfect for when you’re craving something a little spicy, warm, and comforting. The crispy, tandoori chickpeas make it a complete meal with one small serving providing almost 11 grams of protein and 7grams of fiber.

If using a blender, return soup back to pot.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more dry spices, salt, or sweetener to taste. I didn't make any adjustments.Serve with an extra drizzle of coconut milk (optional), a generous amount of tandoori chickpea, and a sprinkle of cilantro (optional).Store leftover soup covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.

Lately, I’ve been trying to focus onprotein.
No,I’m not ignoring how food tastes and shoveling protein shakes in my face. I’mgoing about thingsin a more intentionalway, considering how Ican thoughtfully incorporatemore healthy protein sources into my daily diet.Ya dig?
Turns out, toget moreprotein, simply pay attention to how much protein foods offer, and make each meal count. If you’re looking for a list ofprotein-rich foods, check out my post on 15 Vegan Protein Sources. I also found this articlereally helpful.
Whether you’re lookingto get moreprotein into your dietor not, this recipe is a must-try. Gluten-free pasta is tossed in a creamy, incredibly flavorfulvegan PEA pesto (!!), along with sun-dried tomatoes and arugula. Delicious, nutritious, and readyin 30 minutes!

Yes, peas in pesto. Why, you ask?
First, they’re delicious. Second, they offer 8 grams of protein per cup! That’s crazy, right? I know, it is. Lastly, they create an ultra creamy base for this pesto infused with basil, Italian parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and vegan parmesan cheese.


To keep this recipe gluten free, I relied on my go-to gluten free Fussili Pasta from Trader Joe’s, which is just quinoa and brown rice! I have a discerning palette and can attest that this passes thereal pasta test, and doesn’t give off “healthy pasta” vibes.
Plus, it’s protein rich, with 1 cup cooked providing 5 grams of protein. And let’s be real, we’re totally eating at least 2 cups, so you can go ahead and clock in10 grams of protein (see how I did that? It’s the power of magic and math).

I hope you guys LOVE this pasta! It’s:
Vegan
Gluten Free
Quick
Filling
Insanely Flavorful
Protein-rich
&amp; Healthy
This would make such a great meal when you’re looking for something both comforting and healthy. And since it only takes 30 minutes, it’s doable for both lunch and dinner! Also, can we just talk about the leftovers? So delicious.
And in case you’re curious, 1serving boasts 15+ grams protein, so if you eat 1/3of the recipe(like me), that’s 20grams of protein! Serious plant-based protein powerhouse here, people.

Lemon bars.
So elusive.
So tricky.
So very not vegan (or gluten-free)…until now.

Friends, vegan lemon bars (!!!) made with just10 ingredients, naturally sweetened, and gluten-free! I know, I’m excited, too.
The almond-oat crust is adapted from my Peanut Butter and Jelly Snack Bars, and somehow ends up tasting reminiscent of graham cracker crust! It’s my new favorite thing, besides this über creamy filling.

The filling is comprised of soaked cashews, coconut cream, lots of lemon juice + zest, maple syrup, arrowroot starch (for thickening), and sea salt. That’s it!
I didn’t know what would happen if I blended it all up and baked it, but it turns out, it ends up tasting like a lemon bar with a cheesecake-like texture. SWOON!


Friends, you’re going to LOVE these bars! They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Lemony
Not toosweet
Simple
Surprisingly healthy
Portable
&amp; Delicious
These would make the perfect dessert for so many things: Bridal showers (I know), baby showers (I know!), study dates (yass girl), office gatherings (the least exciting, but still really cool). Even if you don’t have anywhere special to be, these would make a delicious treat tohave around the house for snacking (but watch out – you’ll want 2 or 3).

Then drain thoroughly.In the meantime, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper.Add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a high speed blender and mix on high until a fine meal is achieved.Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and add maple syrup and melted coconut oil, starting with lesser end of range (4 Tbsp or 60 g as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and adding more if it's too dry. Stir with a spoon to combine until a loose dough is formed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil.Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking sheet and spread evenly. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it’s evenly distributed and well packed.Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly, then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (176 C).Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to a high speed blender with coconut cream, arrowroot starch, lemon juice, lemon zest, sea salt, and maple syrup. Mix on high until very creamy and smooth.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a bit more lemon zest and maple syrup. It should be very lemony, and not overly sweet.Pour filling over the pre-baked crust and spread into an even layer. Tap on counter to remove any air bubbles.Bake for 20-23 minutes or until the edges look very slightly dry and the center appears “jiggly” but not liquidy.Let rest for 10 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator to let cool completely (uncovered) - at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.To serve, slice and sift with powdered sugar (optional).

Did you see my Instagram of these meatballs? Did you laugh? Do you like my jokes? Please be my friend.

You guys know I’m on a roll with meatballs.
First were my Easy Vegan Meatballs featuring tempeh, then my Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Meatballs featuring chickpeas. I can’t leavelentilsout of the party, so this is my take using green lentils!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredientsand 30 minutes to prepare (when you start withcooked lentils).
It’s the perfect way to utilize leftover cooked lentils in an exciting, new way. In my opinion, if you put anything atop pasta and red sauce, it’s exciting (what does that tell you about my social life?).
In addition to being simple, these meatballs are also vegan and gluten-free, and packed with flavor thanks to fresh parsley, dried herbs, tomato paste, and vegan parmesan cheese.
They get their golden brown crust from vegan parmesan cheese and a quick sauté in a skillet, before finishing off in the oven to help them crisp up even more. While that’s happening, prepare your accompaniments. I went for carrot noodles – because, love – and store-bought marinara sauce to save time.

I hope you all love these meatballs! They’re:
Tender
Flavorful
Healthy
Easy
Quick
&amp; Delicious
Make these for a weeknight meal when you’re looking for something hearty that doesn’t require too much work. Per 4 meatballs, these pack 10 grams of protein!And if you pair them with a quinoa- or brown rice-based gluten-free pasta, you’ll get another 5-10 grams protein per serving.

","Heat a large skillet over medium heat, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C), and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or more if increasing batch size).Once skillet is hot, add 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), shallot and garlic. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly golden brown (being careful not to burn), then remove from heat and turn off stove top.To a food processor, add flaxseed and water and let set for 2-3 minutes.Add cooked, cooled lentils, 1 tsp olive oil (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), sautéed garlic and shallot, Italian seasonings, parsley, tomato paste, vegan parmesan cheese, and a pinch each salt and pepper. Pulse, mixing until combined, but not puréed, leaving a little texture.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper or herbs for flavor, vegan parmesan for cheesiness and to dry out, or more olive oil to moisten. The texture should be dough-like. If the mixture is still too wet, add coconut or oat flour, or panko bread crumbs if not gluten free.Use a Tablespoon or cookie dough scoop (like this one), to scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts of dough and carefully form into balls. The mixture is moldable, but fragile, so the best way to do this is to rest the dough in the palm of one hand, while using two fingers from the other hand to gently mold/form into a meatball. If it cracks, moisten your fingers with a little water to help reform/bind them. Repeat until all meatballs are formed - about 12 or 13.Roll/coat in vegan parmesan cheese (optional) and arrange on baking sheet.Heat the skillet from earlier over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp olive oil and half of the meatballs (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Brown for 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown, shaking the pan or using a wooden spoon to roll the balls around to cook evenly on all sides.As they are done cooking, transfer to your prepared baking sheet and set in the preheated oven. Repeat process, adding remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to the skillet and sautéing remaining meatballs, then transfer to oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, while you prepare your carrot noodles, pasta and/or marinara sauce.Remove meatballs from oven and let cool slightly - they will firm up the longer they are cooled. Serve over carrot noodles or pasta with marinara sauce.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through."

Have you tried my Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl yet? If not, you absolutely should! It’s one of our most frequently made (and praised)recipes on the blog.
Because I love it so much, I wanted to make an Indian-inspired version. My first attempt was too vegetable heavy and a little dry. I’m all about sauciness and big flavor in dishes, so it was back to the drawing board.
The more I thought about what I actually wanted in an Indian-inspired “Buddha Bowl,” I realized I wanted a few key things: heat, intenseflavor, sauciness, lentils, and brown rice.
Mission accomplished.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes, 1 saucepan(plus a pot for thebrown rice), and 10 ingredients to make!
The base of the recipe is garlic, ginger, carrots sautéed in coconut oil, and red curry paste. Tomato paste and vegetable broth make a deeply flavorful sauce, while turmeric and coconut sugar adddepth of flavor. An optional but recommended last step is a dash of light coconut milk to add creaminess and balance the heat.
Lentils not only add heartiness, but also nutrition. They are extremely high in folate, iron, and magnesium. One serving of this lentil curry boastsnearly 16 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein! Add in some brown rice and you have an incredibly substantial plant-based meal.

I seriously hope not, because this almond butter version is kind ofmy new thing.

These almond butter no bakes are inspired by my chocolate version, and my current snack obsession: A spoonful of salted almond butter dipped in a roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds.

Hey there, lovebirds. Tomorrow’s Valentine’s Day.Are you craving something sweet?
Something a little indulgent, but not so off the rails that you need to implement a new workoutroutine afterwards?
I have just the thing: Easy. Vegan. Chocolate. But no seriously, easy.

I’ve been making chocolate for a while now! My first attempt was chocolate bars, which were delicious and made witha mix of cocoa butter and coconut oil.
Then I went slightly heavier on my cocoa butter : coconut oil ratio in these Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons. So ridiculously good.
Andyou know what I discoveredafter all this experimenting?Cocoa butter is king. Here’s why:
Cocoa butter melts like a dream;
There’s zero coconut flavor;
When you add cacao powder, it becomes super velvety and doesn’t separate;
Once it sets, it doesn’t melt in your hands (like coconut oil);
It just tastes better, creamier, more delicious.
Convinced? Good, because you need some cocoa butter in your life.

This recipe is simple requiring just 3 primaryingredients,1 bowl, and less than30 minutes to prepare!
Plus, it’s customizable. I left mine pretty basic, adding only cacao nibs, a hint of vanilla, and a little sea salt.But you could add dried fruit, candied ginger, toasted nuts, toasted coconut…really anything you’re craving.
Make this chocolate exactly how you like it! It’sthe perfect base for experimenting.

So, why make chocolate at home when you can buy it at the store? Let me tell you.
Homemade is simply better.
It’s naturally sweetened.
No suspicious ingredients.
Vegan, gluten free, guaranteed.
It’s customizable.
It’s fun.
Trust me, homemade chocolate all the way.

I hope you all love this chocolate! It’s:
Velvety
Creamy
Rich
Super chocolatey
Naturally sweetened
Simple
&amp; Decadent

402,Easy Garlic & Herb Vegan Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Garlic &amp; Herb Vegan Cheese

And I thought my cheese days were over.
Yeah, right. Vegan cheese to the rescue!

This recipe is a reader request, and I’m so glad I gave it a try.
Vegan cheese has somewhat eluded me since going completely dairy-free. And to be honest, I’m perfectly content with all my dairy-free alternatives, especially now that I have a trusty Vegan Parmesan Cheese recipe (which I put on practically everything these days).
But there is something to be said for a soft cheese. And what better time to try it than now, especially with Valentine’s Day right around the corner?!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 8 ingredients! And the method is easy as well: Soak cashews, blend with seasonings to flavor, wrap in cheesecloth to absorb liquid, and chill – that’s it!
This cheesedoes involvea bit of planning ahead, since it requires soaking cashews and then chilling your cheese. But the prep is so simple and quick that it’s one of those recipes that happens in the background while you’re doing other things.

So,where does the flavor come from? Good question.
Minced garlic and garlic powder add ‘zing’ and depth;
Lemon zest adds tart and brightness;
Lemon juice adds acidity;
Nutritional yeast adds cheesiness;
Salt adds flavor and, you know, saltiness.
Once it’s done chilling in the fridge, unwrap and coat with fresh dill. Serious yum, and so flavorful.

I hope you all love this cheese! It’s:
Creamy
Soft
Cheesy
Savory
Garlicky
Lemony
Herb-infused
&amp; Entirely delicious
This would make the perfect cheese for a party or a romantic night in for two (cheese, wine, chocolate, strawberries, anyone?). Though it’s best chilled, it does well for a couple hours out of the refrigerator, and keeps for almost a week when properly stored, so you can keep enjoying it for days.
Spread it on crackers, vegetables, andsandwiches.Dollop it on top of soups.Add it to salads, pastas, and everything in between – you can’t go wrong.

","Place cashews in a bowl and cover with cool water. Cover with plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator to soak for 12 hours*. If you can't get to them right away, drain, place back in bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. They will keep refrigerated for 24-36 hours.Once soaked, drain cashews thoroughly and add to food processor. Add minced garlic, garlic powder, lemon zest, lemon juice, water, nutritional yeast, salt and olive oil.Process until very creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Then taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon zest for tartness, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, garlic for zing, or salt for flavor + balance.Place a fine mesh strainer (or colander) over a large mixing bowl, and lay down two layers of cheesecloth (or a clean, fine, absorbent towel).Use a spatula to scoop all cheese over the cheesecloth, then gather the corners and twist the top gently to form the cheese into a ""disc."" Secure with a rubber band.Place in refrigerator to set for at least 6 hours, preferably 12, or until excess moisture has been wicked away, and it holds its form when released from the cheesecloth.To serve, unwrap from cheesecloth and gently invert onto a serving platter. Reform with hands or cheesecloth as needed, then coat with chopped herbs and a bit more lemon zest (optional). It is fragile, so handle gently.Enjoy chilled with crackers or vegetables. Cheese will hold its form for 1-2 hours out of the refrigerator, but best when chilled. Leftovers keep well covered in the refrigerator up to 5 days."
403,Blueberry Muffin Breakfast Cookies (V + GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Blueberry Muffin Breakfast Cookies (Vegan + GF)

You know what Idespise? Airports.
I love traveling, but airports – I mean, the worst.
OK, that’s not fair.Some are adequately stocked with some sub-par options – anything with a Jamba Juice is A-OK in my book. But usually, you get charged $5 for a bottle of water, they spellyour name wrong on your coffee, and there isn’t a vegetable in sight.
However, there is one shining beacon of hope in the Portland airport. Not only does Coffee People have pretty decent coffee and tea – almond milk latte,ftw– they also have something called “The Wonder Muffin.” And that, my friends, is exactly what it is.

I tried and tried to make the gluten-free, vegan blueberry muffinthat would live up to the Wonder Muffin title, but, alas, I did not succeed.It seems that recipe is still floating around out there somewhere in the universe, waiting to be discovered. Until then, breakfast cookies.
After one too many failed muffin attempts, I shifted directions and realizedthe closest thing to a muffin is a breakfast cookie, which is totally doable both vegan andgluten-free!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 1 bowl to prepare! Plus, it’s (vegan) butter-free, vegan, gluten-free, and naturally sweetened. Oh yeah.

These breakfast cookiesare the real deal. They’re:
Tender
Hearty
Loaded with oats + fiber
Blueberry-laced
Perfectly sweet
Healthy
&amp; Delicious
Make this recipe ahead of time to bring along to work or school (or traveling!). They make the perfect light breakfast or snack, are loaded with healthy fiber and protein, and have just over 100 calories per cookie!

Then add applesauce and whisk thoroughly to combine.Add peanut butter or almond butter, vanilla, melted coconut oil, maple syrup or agave nectar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and whisk thoroughly.Add oats, almond meal, and oat flour and mix well until just combined. The batter will look a little wet and sticky - that’s good!Add walnuts and dried blueberries and stir until just combined (see photo). Refrigerate batter for 5 minutes to harden and lightly grease a baking sheet (because there are 24 cookies, you'll need to bake in two batches // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Use a Tablespoon, small spoon, or cookie scoop to scoop batter onto your baking sheet, then press down slightly with your fingers to spread out a little. They won't expand much, so you can put the cookies pretty close together. Top with a few more dried blueberries (optional) and press gently to adhere.Bake for 15-16 minutes or until the cookies are slightly golden brown on the edges.Let rest on baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. After completely cooled, store in an air-tight container to keep fresh for up to a few days. Will keep in the freezer up to 1 month."
404,Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons

I have another recipe for you inspired by my time in Seattle!
These treats arenotfrom Seattle, but from a little shop in Vancouver, BC, where my friend Erin lives – who is a total plant-based rockstar, by the way.
During our stayinSeattle, Erin gifted me a little Vancouver goody bag, and my favorite itemfrom the bunch was a package of double chocolate raw macaroons. Swoon.
One bite in and I knew I wanted to recreate them at home.

This recipe is simple, requiring 6 ingredients andabout30 minutes to prepare.
It’s also raw, meaning the ingredients are raw and are not heated above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 C), in order to preserve the vitamins and nutrients – which means more of the good stuff makes it into your body. Win win!

While I hadtried makingbaked macaroons before, I hadn’t tried making a raw version. Spoiler alert, this version iseven easier, and I found I prefer the raw over the baked!

The coating is made from simple ingredients: cocoa butter (see notes for substitution options), coconut oil, cacao powder, and agave nectar or maple syrup.
That’s right, these beauties are naturally sweetened, which means they’re basically health food (am I right?).

I hope you all love these macaroons! They’re:
Tender with a slight crunch
Perfectly sweet
Super chocolaty
Coconutty
Rich
Surprisingly healthy
Raw
&amp; Delicious
These are great tohave around for a healthier dessert or snack. And because they travel well, they also make a great treatto bring along to parties.

Repeat until all filling is used - about 9-11 macaroons (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), depending on scoop size - then freeze.Add grated cocoa butter and coconut oil to a ceramic bowl set, then set in a shallow dish (such as an 8x8 baking dish) filled with almost boiling hot water - this will keep the recipe raw - see notes for more options/details.Let the cocoa butter and coconut oil rest, stirring occasionally, until completely melted. Then add your cacao powder and whisk.Add sweetener to taste. I found 4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to be about right for me.Remove the macaroons from the freezer and dip the bottoms in the raw chocolate. Place back on baking sheet and move back to freezer to set for 5 minutes.Remove macaroons from freezer once more and dip the tops in the chocolate, using a spoon to brush the chocolate up the sides until fully coated.Flip back over and set on baking sheet. Top with a sprinkle of sea salt or a few coconut flakes (optional), then place back in freezer to set.You may have leftover chocolate, which can be used to coat fruit (such as strawberries), or poured into mini muffin liners for individual-sized chocolates.These can be eaten straight from the freezer, but I prefer them at room temperature because they are a bit softer in texture and you can more fully enjoy the flavors.Store leftovers covered at room temperature up to 3 days, in the refrigerator 4-5 days or in the freezer 3-4 weeks."
405,General Tso's Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"General Tso’s Tofu Stir-Fry

This is one of those comfort food dishesthat you make when a serious takeout craving hits, but youstill want to cook at hometo save a few calories and dollars.
My General Tso’s tofu is the perfect balance of spicy, sweet, and savory. It is loaded with protein (20+ grams per serving!) and comes together in just 30 minutes!

This recipe is a reader request – thanks Marshette!
Much like Singapore Noodles, I had never actually tried General Tso’s stir fry before. But from what I hear, it’s traditionally lightly battered and fried chicken tossed with a savory-sweet sauce, and cooked with green onion and dried red chilies for heat.
I think I can get on board with that.


To keep my version plant-based, I went with tofu. If you’ve followed this blog for long, you’ve probably seen my favorite way to make tofu taste good.
Well, even though I still love that method, I may love this new method even more (one I adaptedfrom The Kitchn)!
Simply marinate the tofu in a bit of soy sauce, maple syrup, and chili garlic sauce before dredging in cornstarch and pan-frying in a little oil. The result is a flavorful tofu that’s crispy on the outside, tender (not mushy) on the inside, and comes together in about20 minutes!

This dish gets some serious heat from dried red chilies, which you can find in most traditional and Asian grocery stores. However, if you have trouble locating some, either use fresh red chilies or extra chili garlic sauce.
Whatever you do, don’t skip the heat! That’s what makes this dish balanced and delicious.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this fake-out takeout dish. It’s:
Extremelyflavorful
Perfectly spiced
Not too sweet
Satisfying
Comforting
Quick
&amp; Dang delicious
This would make the perfect entrée to make when you’re craving takeout but want to stay in and make it a little healthier! Don’t get me wrong – I wouldn’t call this “health food.” But it is much lighter than what you’ll find at restaurants. Plus, 20 grams protein per serving!

","If serving with rice and broccoli, begin preparing at this time. Otherwise, move onto the next step.Wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top to wick away moisture, such as a cast iron skillet. Let rest for about 10 minutes.Prep/chop green onions, garlic, and ginger at this time. Set aside.While tofu is pressing, prepare sauce by combining sesame oil, cornstarch, minced garlic, minced ginger, rice vinegar, coconut sugar or maple syrup, tamari or soy sauce, and water in a small mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly to combine. If using coconut sugar, make sure it’s dissolved before proceeding. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed (I left mine as is).Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet (mine is 10”) over medium heat. In the meantime, unwrap tofu and cut into even pieces, about 3/4-inch cubes (see photo).Add tofu to a shallow mixing bowl (see photo) and top with tamari or soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and maple syrup. Toss to combine. Let rest 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.Use a slotted spoon or fork to transfer tofu to a quart-size or large freezer bag. Add cornstarch 1 Tbsp at a time and toss to coat. Continue adding more cornstarch and tossing until tofu is coated in a gummy, white layer - about 5 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).To the hot skillet, add 2 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) grape seed oil and let warm for 30 seconds. Then use a slotted spoon or fork to add tofu to the pan (leaving any excess cornstarch behind).Cook on all sides for 1 minute, or until light golden brown. You don’t want it blackened or burned, as you’ll be cooking it again later with the sauce. Aim for a consistent golden brown crust (see photo). Remove tofu from pan as it’s finished browning. Set aside.Return skillet to burner and increase heat to medium-high. Add 1 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) sesame oil, chopped green onions, and dried red chilies. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.Add the sauce and tofu. Cook, stirring frequently, to coat the tofu and vegetables for 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through and the sauce has slightly thickened (see photo).Remove pan from heat and add sesame seeds (optional). Toss to coat.Serve with rice and steamed broccoli (optional), or other desired sides. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Reheat on the stovetop or microwave."

Care to divulge your secrets? Please say yes. Please say yes.

OK, I’ll tell you. But it’s so simple you’ll laugh.
1. Make sure your wet ingredients thoroughly coat your dry ingredients.
2. Don’t stir your granola while it’s baking.
3. Let it cool completely, then break into clumps.
That’s it! Oh man, so easy. Now let’s talk flavors, yo.

This 9-ingredient granola is infused with coconut three ways: coconut sugar, oil, and flakes.
The base is rolled oats, pecans, and slivered almonds– a combination I’ve foundto work perfectly to create those dreamy little clusters.
This granola is alsonaturally sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrupand sprinkled with dried blueberries.
If you’ve never tried dried blueberries, prepare to fall in love. They’re a blueberry, but somehow 10,000x better. It’s like eating blueberry jam. Trust me. You’re gonna want that.

Have I ever told you I was raised on spicy food?
If I was to survey my dad’s pantryright now, I’d likely only find canned soup, black pepper, and a giant jarof jalapeños. You know, the essentials.
Icoat my food withblack pepper before ever trying it. When we eat Thai, you can hardly see my food under the blanket ofsriracha. When we order takeout, Irequest “extra spicy, no seriously.”
It’s a habit I’ve passed on to John, too, who now outdoes me in the hot sauce department, and has become even more of a sauce addict than I am. We’re quite the pair.

This recipe was inspired by a meal afriendmade me a long time ago. It was so simple but so delicious:Buffalo chicken wraps with bleu cheese dressing, romaine lettuce,and vegetables.
It was so, so good that it has stuck in my mind and I’ve been wanting to make a plant-based version ever since.

This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutes.The concept is sosimple:
3-ingredient hummus-based dressing, tossed with romaine lettuce;
Chickpeas seasonedwithhot sauce + garlic powder, and lightlysautéed;
Addto a pita or tortilla, roll up, and serve!
Yes, it’s that easy.

I hope you all love these wraps! They’re:
Savory
Spicy
Hearty
Crunchy from the vegetables
Tender from the chickpeas
Quick
Protein- + fiber-filled
&amp; Delicious
These would make the perfect lazy weeknight dinner when you’re craving something satisfying but quick. If you’re weary of the spice level, it’s actually quite mild against the dressing! But you can always scale back and go for more of a classic crispy chickpea as well.

Ah, the Caesar salad. It’s something to behold.
I don’t know how many times I’ve gazed longingly upon other diner’s salads, whilemy sad, oily balsamic vinaigrette drips down lettuce that deserved something better. Something creamier. Something zesty. Something garlicky.
I think youget where this is going. I’m tired of not being able to enjoyCaesar saladbecause the dressing isn’t dairy-free. So I decided to make my own!
The best part is, it only takes 5 minutes. No cashew soaking, grinding, or blending involved. You cando this – and you totally should.

The base for this simple,6-ingredient, 5-minute dressing is hummus. It creates a creamy, savory base that’s easy to come by since there’s almost always hummus in the fridge. Or at least in my fridge.
Next comes copious amounts of minced garlic, capers for that salty ocean taste, lemon juice + zest for brightness, and a little spicy mustard for zing. Add salt and pepper to taste and you’re good to go.

I hope you all love this dressing! It’s:
Creamy
Bold
Savory
Briney
Garlicky
Slightly spicy

A fewweeks ago I shared these pancakes on Instagram and asked if it would be too forwardto call them“Better than Sex Pancakes.” Most of you agreed it was a great name, a few of you were a tad embarrassed, and a handful of others offered up even raunchier title ideas. I was laughing all day reading your comments.
After doing more brainstorming about what to call these beauties, I went with something a little more tame and descriptive of what they actually are. But between you and me, these pancakes could totally live up to the name “better than sex cakes” because that’s how insanely delicious they are.
Your eyes will roll back.
You’ll want to devour them in seconds.
You’ll savor every bite.
They’ll leave youabsolutely satisfied.
Friends, you’re gonna want these pancakes.

Do you shop at Trader Joe’s? It’s my go-togrocery store, because, awesome.
Every once in a while I spy a sample at their food counter that’s worth trying. My favorite one over the summer was Tuscan cantaloupe with fresh basil – genius!
One day I saw them samplingtoasted coconut pancakes, and I squealed a little inside. The aroma had me hypnotized. But when I glanced over the ingredients on the box, I realized they were a no-go for me because ofmilk powder.
So, I took a mental note of the flavors and decided to get to work on my own version.

This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutes to make. Plus, it’s wholesome, with the addition ofspelt flour and oat flour, and coconut sugar and maple syrup to sweeten. And can I just say, they’re a total FLAVOR BOMB?
Aside frommy beloved Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Pancakes (which helped launched this blog), these are my new favorite.

Coconut is infused four ways. Yes, FOUR!
Shredded coconut
Coconut sugar
Coconut milk
&amp; Coconut oil
One of my favorite parts is the sprinkle of coconut on the tops of the pancakes, added while cooking. SO, good.

Trust me friends, you’re going to want these pancakes in your life. They’re:
Fluffy
Pillowy
Tender
Super coconutty
Perfectly sweet
Surprisingly healthy
Easy
&amp; Insanely delicious
Make these pancakes your new go-to lazy weekend breakfast. Or, if you need a special treat during the week, make the batter ahead of time (up to 2 days) and prepare them the morning of. If you’re really in a hurry, make up a batch and freeze them, and then reheat in the toaster, oven, or microwave.
My favorite toppings are more toasted coconut and a drizzle of maple syrup or agave. The result is something out of this world. Dare I say, better than sex?

Sprinkle on a little untoasted coconut and coconut sugar.Flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges appear slightly dry - about 3 minutes.Cook for 2-3 minutes more, or until fully cooked through in the middle.To serve, top with vegan butter and a drizzle of maple syrup or agave nectar, or toasted coconut.Leftovers will reheat well in the microwave or in a 350 degrees F (176 C) oven.

Ispasta for breakfasta thing?
If not, I vote itshould be. When you taste how amazing this pasta is, you’re going to want itall hoursof the day.

Have you ever had a sauce-less pasta? I know it sounds boring. But here’s the thing – it’s not.
Al-dente pasta tossed in garlic-and-chili-infused olive oil, fresh parsley, and vegan parmesan cheese. You won’t be missing the cream sauce one bit.

This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 basic ingredients.
And the flavors and preparation are so simple it makes a great weeknight staple.
Don’t worry. Ifyou’re weary of cauliflower, try it roasted! If you season it well – in this case with red pepper flakes, garlic, and sea salt – it roasts up beautifully and pairs incredibly well with this light pasta dish.

Simple
Savory
Fresh
Garlicky
Subtly spiced
Dusted with vegan parmesan cheese

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Add cauliflower to a mixing bowl with olive oil, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and sea salt. Toss to coat. Then spread on a baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, flipping/stirring once at the 15-minute mark to ensure even cooking. Sample and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.Once your cauliflower has reached the 10-minute mark, add vegetable broth (for added flavor | optional) and about 4-5 cups water (or however much to generously cover your pasta) to a large pot and bring to a boil.Once boiling, season well with sea salt and add pasta. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and cook according to package instructions for ‘al dente’ - 7-10 minutes. Then drain and set aside. Cover with a towel to keep warm.Heat the same large pot over medium-low heat. Once hot, add 1/4 cup olive oil and 3 cloves smashed NOT minced garlic (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Sauté 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until garlic is fragrant and slightly golden brown. Remove garlic from pan and let cool slightly, then mince. Set aside for serving.Next add red pepper flakes to infuse the olive oil for 1-2 minutes.Add cooked pasta, parsley, pine nuts, minced garlic, vegan parmesan cheese, cauliflower, and toss to coat.Remove from heat and sample pasta. Adjust seasonings as desired, adding salt or pepper if necessary. Serve hot with additional parsley, red pepper flakes, pine nuts and vegan parmesan cheese.

Look at that crispy edge. You’re gonna want that crispy edge.
Trust me, I ate a circle around the pan to confirm it’s the best part (and it totally is).

This baked oatmeal is theperfect dishfor lazy weekends, hosting a house full of guests, or brunch, because it’s quick and easy and it feeds a crowd.
The recipe comes together in about 1 hour, requires just 10 simple ingredients, and is vegan, gluten-free, naturally-sweetened, and vegan butter-free!
Whew, that was a mouthful (but so worth it).

This oatmeal is inspired by a recipeI sawin Real Simplemagazine thatimmediately caught my eye. Only this version is egg-free, and infused with coconut three ways. That’s right THREE: Coconut flakes, coconut milk, and coconut oil.
That’s a lot of coconut, and it’s oh-so-delicious.
You really don’t need much in the way oftoppings. In fact,just pour on some almond milk and call it breakfast! But if you wanna get all fancy, coconut whipped cream, figs (or fresh fruit), and toasted coconut make a perfect finishing touch.


I hope you guys love this recipe! It’s:
Simple
Hearty
Wholesome
Coconut-infused
Perfectly sweet
Satisfying
Healthy
&amp; Delicious
This would make a dreamy weekend breakfast, or even one you could make ahead of time and reheat throughout the week for a quicker meal option!It’s especially idealthroughout the winter, especially whenhosting guests – it’s the ultimate warming, comfort food.
If you aren’t into coconut, don’t worry! Simply swap out the coconut milk for almond, and the coconut flakes for something that sounds more your style, like chocolate chips (ey-oh)!

414,Orange Almond Biscotti (Vegan) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Orange Almond Biscotti (Vegan)

Friends, are you ready for vegan biscotti perfection? Because that’s exactly what’s about to go down.
Let’s bake, yo.

When I imagine a dreamy, idyllic morning, it involves a hot drink of some kind, biscotti, and sitting by a window with my journal or a good book. Oh, and obviously stretchy pants and an oversized sweater are involved. That’s a given.
A reader requested I make vegan biscotti (hi, Aditi!), and I thought it was such a great idea.
In my research, I learned biscotti means “twice baked” in Italian. And, as you might’ve guessed, this crunchy cookie traditionally enjoyed with a hot beverage originates from Italy – swoon. My girl, Giada, knows what’s up.

This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 1 bowl and 10 ingredients! It’s also madewithcoconut oiland sweetened with organic cane sugar (sub coconut sugar if you’d like!).
If you’ve never made biscotti, the concept is very straightforward.
Make a cookie dough, shape it into two logs, bake until slightly golden brown, and cool. Then slice into small segments and bake once more. That’s it! That is, unless you want to dip these beauties into dark chocolate (and why wouldn’t you want to do that, I ask?).

I think you guys are going to LOVE these biscotti! They’re:
Crunchy
Slightly tender on the inside
Perfectly sweet
Orange-scented
Studded with toasted almonds
Insanely delicious
&amp; Easy to make
These would make the perfect treat to go alongside your favorite hot beverage in the morning, or for an evening dessert. A perfect pairing would bemy 5-minute Vegan Hot Cocoa, or my 3-Ingredient Ginger Latte. Serious yum.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Melt coconut oil in a large mixing bowl. Add organic cane sugar and whisk thoroughly to combine.Add pumpkin puree and vanilla and whisk until completely combined.Next add flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and orange zest. Stir until combined, but try not to over-mix.Add almonds and stir once more to evenly disperse.Use a knife or spatula to divide the dough into two even sections (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then using damp hands, form the two portions into long, semi-skinny logs (see photo). Try and make them as uniform in size and shape as possible so they bake evenly.Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes, or until just slightly brown on the edges. Let cool slightly on the baking sheet, then use a serrated knife to gently slice into 3/4-inch pieces. Be very gentle when slicing, especially where the almonds are as they can crumble easily. I discarded (ate) the very end pieces because they were too small and already quite brown.Gently turn the biscotti on their sides and return to the oven to bake for another 20 minutes, gently flipping once at the halfway point (10 minutes), to ensure even baking.Let cool briefly before enjoying. If dipping in chocolate, add chopped chocolate to a mixing bowl and microwave in 30 second increments until melted, or melt over a double boiler on the stovetop.Once the biscotti are slightly cooled, dip one half of the biscotti into the chocolate, use a spoon to spread it slightly, then scrape off the excess.Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet to dry. To speed setting, pop in the freezer. Otherwise, let dry at room temperature until completely set.Store covered at room temperature for 3-4 days (I found a large jar is ideal). Will keep well-sealed in the freezer for up to 1 month. Enjoy with hot tea, hot toddies, hot chocolate, ginger lattes, or chai latte!"

Cheesy.
Sexiness in a bowl.
Sweatpants on.
Lights dimmed.
Ya dig?

Risotto is serious, Italian comfort food. Have you ever tried it?
Although it’s insanely creamy, there’s no cream involved as the liquid brings out the starch in the arborio rice, giving the dish that luxurious texture.
While risotto traditionally relies onbutter and cheese for flavor, it’s easily made vegan when you substitute vegan butter and vegan parmesan cheese – my go-to toppingfor everything these days.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 8ingredients and about 30 minutes to make.If you’ve ever been intimidated to try risotto, don’t be! It’s really quite simple.
Sauté mushrooms, set aside.
Sauté leeks.
Add rice.
Stir in hot vegetable stock, little by little, while stirring, until ‘al dente’ – about 15 minutes.
Add vegan butter (optional), vegan parmesan cheese, and mushrooms.
Stir, garnish, serve.
It’s really that easy. But if you’re still worried, I included a link in the notestosome helpful risotto dos and don’ts to ensure you get the perfect flavor and texture.

This risotto is straight up dreamy. It’s:
Creamy
Savory
Comforting
Warm
‘Cheesy’
Simple
&amp; Satisfying
This would make the perfect dish when you’re craving carbs andcheesiness. Though it can be enjoyed as an entrée, it would also make a delicious side on Italian night – Eggplant Lasagna Roll-Ups anyone?

","In a small saucepan, heat vegetable broth over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep warm.In the meantime, heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add half the olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and mushrooms. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until tender and slightly browned - 3-4 minutes - stirring frequently. Remove from pan and set aside in a small dish.Heat the same large saucepan over medium heat once more. Once hot, add remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and leeks. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, or until softened and very slightly browned.Add arborio rice, and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally to coat.Add dry white wine and stir gently. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.Using a ladle, add warmed vegetable stock 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling, or it will get gummy and cook too fast.Continue to add vegetable stock, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is 'al dente' - cooked through but still has a slight bite. This whole process should only take 15-20 minutes (time based on original recipe // adjust if altering batch size).Once the rice is cooked through and al dente, remove from heat and add vegan butter (optional), vegan parmesan cheese, and most of the cooked mushrooms from earlier, reserving a few for serving. Stir to coat.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste or more vegan parmesan to enhance the cheesiness.To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with remaining mushrooms, additional vegan parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of parsley (optional).Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days."

I’m kind of on a papaya kick, if you haven’t noticed.
Last week I shared my take on a Vegan Papaya Salad (seriously, so good). Last summerI shared my Tropical Papaya Boats(hello fruity dessert heaven). And this week, a papaya smoothie! For not being my #1 favorite fruit, I must admit, papaya is growing on me. I even tried a pomelo this week. Who am I?

This smoothie was inspired by a surplus of papaya after experimenting with my papaya salad. I had some leftover fruit and decided to freeze it, which lends itself perfectly to smoothies. Plus, papaya is incredibly nutritiousand detoxifying with tons of vitamin C, antioxidants, digestive enzymes, and folate, among other health benefits.
As always, this recipe is simple, requiring just 6 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes to prepare.
Frozen papaya and bananamake up the creamy, naturally sweet base, while ginger and lime add a balance of zing and acidity. Carrot juice gives it a beautiful orange color and even morenutrients, while coconut milk adds healthy fats and creamy coconut flavor.Major swoon.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this smoothie! It’s:
Creamy
Fruity
Tropical
Coconut-infused
Slightly tart
Healthy

Canyou ever really have too many dips in your life?I think not.
Care for one more? I hope so, because I have the simplest, most flavorful Mediterranean-inspired dip loaded with healthy ingredients + protein. It’s the perfect appetizer or snack and can even be converted into a meal.
No, I’m not joking.Let’s get to it.

This recipe was born out of my intense love for all things Mediterranean, as well as my lack of lentil recipes on the blog! Up until now, the only other dishes with lentils aremy Kale, Lentil &amp; Roasted Beet Salad, Simple Vegan Stuffing, and1-Hour Vegan Shepherd’s Pie. Swoon.
Lentils are the unsung hero of plant-based cooking. Besides containing 9 grams proteinper 1/2 cup cooked,they’re also high in fiber, B vitamins, iron, and folate, among other benefits. Plus, they cook in less than 30 minutes and take on virtually any flavor you’re craving.

All in all, this dip requiresabout 30 minutesand only10 ingredients! Plus, it’s vegan, gluten-free, and perfect with pita chips or vegetables (to keep it gluten free). If you’re a sucker for kalamata olives like me, throw a few on for garnish – it won’t disappoint.

I hope you all love this dip! It’s:
Creamy
Hearty
Zesty
Mediterranean-spiced
Filling
Simple
&amp; Delicious
This would make a lovely appetizer dip when hosting guests or to take along to parties, as it’s portable anddelicious at room temperature for hours.
It would also be a nice high protein snacktohave around during the week. Or, to make it more substantial, throw it on top ofa baked sweet potato or saladfor a quick + easy plant-based meal.

418,Vegan Papaya Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Papaya Salad

Can I make a confession? We have a new Sunday tradition.
It used to be pizza;now, it’s Pad Thai and papaya salad. OK, that’s not so bad. But the bad part is we get it delivered while sitting at home in our stretchy pants. And the worst part is it’s every Sunday.
I think you know where this is going.

I have eaten papaya salad so many times at this point that I needed to know how to make it at home.
And before anyone jumps to the comments and yells, “Papaya salad is made with green papaya! Not pink papaya,” I say this:
“I know! I tried, but guess what? I couldn’t find an underripe green papaya. So justfindthe greenest papaya you can and it’ll still work out.”
In an ideal world, you would walk intoa store that sells underripe green papaya. But that doesn’t always happen. And the good news is Itriedit with a barelyripe papaya and it was still ridiculously delicious. I mean, ridiculously.
See how everything works out in the end? I knew you’d come around.

OK, on to the important stuff.
This recipe comes together in just 30 minutes! Andit’s easy!
I was sure this recipe was going to fail because Thai dishes can sometimes be a little complicated and intimidating. But not this one! Trust me, you can do it.

The sauce is where the magic happens. Honestly, even if you can’t find a papaya and just end up using carrots, cabbage, and tomato, it’s still insanely delicious, because the sauce is where it’s at.
Peanuts, garlic, Thai chilies, coconut sugar, salt, lime juice, and vegan fish sauce (see the notes for a quick + easy recipe). Talk about a flavor bomb.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this salad! It’s:
Zingy Spicy Naturally sweetened Vegetable-packed Crunchy Fresh Flavorful &amp; Just amazingly delicious
This would make the perfect side dish to entrées likeSpring Rolls, Creamy Thai Carrot Soup, Singapore Noodles, and Pad Thai (our go-to recipe is in 31 Meals!). Or, you could add my favorite crispy peanut tofu and call ita meal in itself!

If you haven’t guessed by now that I’m obsessed with chickpeas and Mediterranean food, you haven’t been paying very close attention. (Come on guys.)
But just in case you haven’tgotten that message loud and clear yet, I have another shawarma-inspired recipe that’s healthy, super flavorful, crowd-pleasing, and comes together in just 30 minutes. You in?

Since making my Chickpea Shawarma Sandwich, I’ve been craving it just about every day. But sometimes, you want something heavier on the greens, and less bread-y. This is the recipe for those instances.
I season chickpeas with a smattering of shawarma spices and bake them until crispy. While that’s happening, chop up your salad and add toa mixing bowl. Top with pita chips (homemade or store-bought), prepare your 3-ingredient Garlic Dill dressing, and you’re ready to go.

This salad is everything I love in a meal. It’s:
Healthy
Flavorful
Filling
Vegetable-heavy
Protein-packed
Simple
Fresh

This would be the perfect weeknight meal when you don’t have a lot of time but want something healthy and satisfying (nearly 20 grams protein per serving!). It would be especially great for hosting family or friends that aren’t plant-based, because it’s so flavorful and filling they won’t miss the meat at all.
And if you store leftovers separately, it remains fresh for days, which makes it great for weekday lunches. Double win.

OK, maybe I’ve matured a little since 13. Not much, but a little.
Now I know there is so much to look forward to after Christmas. For one, there’s New Year’s Eve and that inspiring task of coming up with new resolutions for the year to come (ours are coming soon!).
You get to evaluate what you did in the year past, look ahead, and paint a picture of what you’d like to achieve. Now that’s just plain thrilling in my world.
You know what else is thrilling? Sweet potatoes. Specifically, sweet potatoes stuffed with quinoa and all the Mexican-inspired toppings. Get on board.

This recipe is simple, requiring just basic 10 ingredients (give or take a topping). And it’s healthy, entirely plant-based,and gluten-free.
Not to mention, it’s the perfect way to refuel the healthy way after a week of less-than-nutritious eating.

I think you guys are going to LOVE these potatoes. They’re:
Tender
Naturally sweet
Subtly spiced
Layered with toppings
Drizzled in avocado-cilantro sauce
Flavorful
Healthy
&amp; Filling
While some people’s instincts may be to go the salad route after the holidays (no shame in that), I say a girl (or boy) still has to eat, so let’s fill up the healthy way, shall we? This would be an especially great meal to serve to lingering house guests, especially alongside some piping-hot soup. Serious yum.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Poke a few holes in the sweet potatoes with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape.Once oven is hot, bake sweet potatoes directly on oven rack (with a baking sheet below to catch any drippings) for 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until tender to the touch. Time will vary depending on size of potato.In the meantime, heat a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add rinsed quinoa and toast for 3-5 minutes, or until all water is evaporated and quinoa is fragrant and slightly toasted.Add water, a pinch of sea salt, lime juice and bring to a simmer. Then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. (For more tips, see this helpful article from Food52.)Remove quinoa from heat and season with another healthy pinch sea salt and 1/4 tsp ground cumin (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Stir, adjust seasonings as desired, and set aside, slightly covered.To prepare dressing, add all ingredients besides water to a blender or food processor and blend. Add only enough water to encourage blending. Scrape down sides as needed.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lime, salt, cumin or sweetener as desired. Set aside.Prepare any remaining toppings, such as chopped onion, cilantro or crushed tortilla chips (optional).To serve split open baked potatoes and gently press in on both ends to allow room for toppings. Fill each potato with 1 Tbsp salsa, and 1/4 - 1/2 cup cooked quinoa.Top with a healthy drizzle of avocado-cilantro sauce, and any other desired toppings (hot sauce, extra cilantro, and tortilla chips being my favorite). Best when fresh, though leftovers store separately in the refrigerator up to 2 days."

It’s time to liven things up for the holidays. What do you say?
I’m kind of pumpkin-ed out anyway, if that’s even possible. That means one thing: It’s time to rely on my go-toChristmas flavor combination – chocolate peppermint.
Let’s get festive!


The concept for this recipe was adapted from myGluten-Free Birthday Cake! Tender, vegan, and gluten-free chocolate cupcakes infused with peppermint oil and topped with peppermint coconut whipped cream and all kinds of minty things.
Sounds complicated, huh? It’s not!
This recipe requires just 1 bowl, simple methods, and about 1 hour to prepare.

The coconut whipped cream is the perfect light and fluffy topping for these rich, chocolatycupcakes. The peppermint oil adds an extra cooling effect, and the crushed peppermint adds just a little crunch. Major swoon.

I think you’re going to LOVE these cupcakes! They’re:
Chocolaty
Minty
Tender
Moist
Fluffy
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Dreamy
These cupcakes are perfect for serving at holiday gatherings, or even to make as little homemade gifts! Who would turn away a cupcake that looks this pretty? Throwin some of my Quinoa Granola and your friends will be utterly spoiled.

","FOR CUPCAKES: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line a muffin tin with 11 paper liners (I like this brand // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), or lightly grease.Measure out almond milk and add vinegar or lemon juice. Stir and let curdle while moving onto the next step.Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add baking soda to the almond milk vinegar mixture and stir.Add the sugar, maple syrup and almond milk mixture to the flax egg and beat to combine. Then add melted coconut oil, applesauce, salt, and peppermint extract, and mix.Add cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour, and gluten-free flour blend and beat to combine. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk, but it should be perfect. If too thin, add a little more gluten free flour blend + cocoa powder. Taste and adjust amount of peppermint extract as needed.Divide batter evenly between lined muffin tins (should be enough for 11 as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), filling generously 3/4 full.Bake for 29-34 minutes or until puffy and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Let rest in the tin for 10-15 minutes, then remove and let cool completely on a cooling rack. Don’t try to sample early because they need to fully cool or they tend to stick to the wrappers.FOR COCONUT WHIP: Rinse out mixing bowl and add two cans hardened, chilled coconut cream. Beat until light and fluffy, then add peppermint extract and organic powdered sugar to taste. Taste and adjust flavors as needed. Then scoop into a large freezer bag and set in refrigerator to chill.Once cupcakes are completely cooled and you're ready to serve, cut a corner of the coconut whipped cream bag off and pipe a generous amount onto each cupcake. You’ll likely have leftovers.Lastly, add desired toppings, such as crushed peppermint candy and fresh mint leaves.Will keep well-covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best when fresh. If possible, don't frost until serving for best results!"
424,Simple Hazelnut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cinnamon Hazelnut Butter

How is already almost Christmas!? I don’t even know.
If you’re anything like me, you’re probablythe worst gift-giver ever. You and Ishow up at places where everyone else is bestowing gifts, and we’rethe ones awkwardly standing in the corner, empty handed because we either forgot, ran out of time, or lacked the creativity to think of something gift-worthy.
On the upside, wedid manage to find a really good sale on boots for ourselvesearlier, so go us!
I know, we’rethe worst. But I have a solution.

Nuts. OK, not just nuts, but nut butter!
Everyone loves nut butter and it’s such a guaranteed way to make someone’s day.Plus, chances are they’ll actually use and enjoy it unlike some other gifts – which is the best kind of gift to receive.

Here’s the deal with hazelnuts. They’re extremely healthy for you.
Beyond just beinghigh in protein and healthy fats, hazelnuts are the tree nut withthe highest amount of folate (helps create normal red blood cells), they’re high in fiber (important for digestion), and rich in manganese (needed for bone formation) and copper (needed for iron absorption).
They’re also highin biotin, which is a B Vitamin that helps grow strong, healthy hair.
I rest my case. You need hazelnuts in your life.

Not only do you get the health benefits of hazelnuts, you also get a dose of cinnamon, which everyone knows is high in antioxidants, has anti-inflammatory properties, and can lower blood sugar levels. Not to mention it tastes like the holidays.
Lucky for you this edible gift requires just 3 ingredients and 30 minutes to make.
And, it’s totally customizable. Sub pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon for a more autumnal feel, or swap it for melted dark chocolate togo for my 4-Ingredient Vegan Nutella instead! Who would turn away Nutella? No one with good taste, am I right?

I hope you all love this nut butter. It’s:
Creamy
Slightly crunchy
Salty
Perfectly sweet
Cinnamon-infused
Satisfying
&amp; Delicious on everything
Not only does this make a great gift (package it in little mason jars and wrap it with ribbon), it’s also a great spread to have around for things liketoast, pancakes, waffles, and more. My personal favorite way to enjoyhazelnut butter is dipping a spoonful into roasted sunflower seeds and eating it right off the spoon! It’s also extremely delicious on bananas, rice cakes, and pretty much everything else.

We’d love to see what you come up with, whether you decide to gift it or keep it for yourself (no judgment either way). Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and add hazelnuts to a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast for a total of 12-15 minutes, or until fragrant and golden brown.Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Then transfer to a large kitchen towel and use your hands to roll the nuts around and remove most of the skins (see photo). You want to get as much as possible off because it yields a creamier nut butter. But it doesn’t have to be perfect!Leaving excess skin behind, scoop hazelnuts into a food processor or high speed blender. Blend on low until a butter begins to form - about 7-9 minutes total - scraping down sides as needed.Once the hazelnut butter is creamy and smooth, add the ground cinnamon, sea salt, and coconut sugar (optional).Blend/puree again until well incorporated. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Transfer hazelnut butter to a clean jar and store at room temperature for up to 3 weeks, or in the refrigerator for up to 2 months (or more)."

Quinoa. In brittle.
I know. This is exciting stuff.

Remember my 7-Ingredient Quinoa Granola? Yep, that’s good stuff (and would make an excellent holiday gift!).
Well, whileI was testing that recipe,I noticed a few of the edge pieces got especially caramelized and tasted like brittle! It was a little light bulb moment. I never thought “healthy” brittle could be a thing, but guess what? It totally is.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and about 30 minutes to prepare(plus a little extra for cooling).
It’s naturally sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrup, calls for coconut oil in place ofvegan butter, and is jam-packed with nutrient-dense ingredientslike oats, chia seeds,and quinoa! That’s right, there’s protein in this dessert. Does it get any better than that?!

I think you guys are going to LOVE this brittle! It’s:
Crispy

426,Coconut Oil Blueberry Scones | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Oil Blueberry Scones with Rosemary

Can you believe I haven’t made a single vegan scone for this blog? Me neither! That had to change.
Luckily, the perfect inspiration came from a cozy little coffee shop on the Oregon Coast called Sea Levelthat serves up a savory rosemary blueberry scone that’s a total game changer.
It was love at firstbite, and I immediately knew I wanted to try and recreate it at home. So, I got to work.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to prepare.
After some testing, I settled on a mix of spelt flour and unbleached all purpose flour for the base.
I did attempt a gluten free version, but it didn’t work out (if you find success, let me know in the comments!). I also thinkyou could use all spelt for a heartier scone, or all unbleached all purpose for a lighter, bakery-style scone. The choice is totally up to you.
I used organic cane sugar to sweeten –but just a little. I didn’t want the end result to be too sweet or too savory – rather, somewhere right in the middle.
And in place of vegan butter, I used coconut oil, which worked beautifully! This is a swap I’ve been making in my baking recipes lately (like theCoconut Oil Pie Crust!) and loving the results.

Wild blueberries add a burst of color and natural sweetness to the scones, whilerosemary complements the fruitbeautifully while adding an earthy flavor that’snot overwhelming.
Who knew rosemary and blueberry could be such good friends?

These scones bake up beautifully. I think you’re going to love them. They’re:
Perfectly flaky
Tender on the inside
Crisp on the outside
Not toosweet
Slightly savory
Studded with berries+herbs
&amp; Positively delicious
These would make the perfect snackto share with a friend over coffee or tea. It doesn’t get much better. They would also be great as a light breakfast, snack, or healthier dessert.

Pardon me while I present yet another noodle-free ‘pasta’ dish that’s like the originalbut somehow better and entirely plant-based.
Not to brag or anything, but this is totally happening (again), and it totally rules.

This lasagna is inspired by three things:
1) My love for lasagna (forever and ever, amen)
2) My successfulrecreations of it usingboth eggplant + spaghetti squash
3) My never-ending love affair with sweet potatoes

The filling is my go-to tofu ricotta. It’s creamy, lemony, herby, delicious, and a convincingdupe for the real thing. Trust me on this one – you need this in your life.
And the ‘pasta noodles’ arethinly-sliced sweet potatoes, which addthe perfect tender texture and sweet flavor contrast to the savory ‘ricotta.’ In other words,swoon.


How is this recipe simple? I’m so glad you asked. It requires just 9 basicingredients, simple methods, and about 1 hour from start to finish.
While this recipe lacks amarinara sauce as in a traditional lasagna, I argue it doesn’t need it! However, if you’re a sauce-lover like me, I do include an optional (but highly recommended) basil pesto sauce that’s positively amazing (and still keeps the recipe within my 10-ingredient standard).
It not only adds a burst of vibrant green color, but alsoa punch of herby-garlic flavor that finishes the dish perfectly (in my humble opinion).

Do you have those friends in your life that you can invite over anytime, regardless of whetheror not you have on “real clothes” (read:pajamas), or you’ve showered in the last threedays, or there’s a dusting of flour all over the kitchen from your fourth attempt at vegan scones?
I do. They’re our next door neighbors and I’m so thankful for them.
We actually met last year whentheypopped over around Christmas time to deliver some cookies. Nice, right? Why didn’t I think of that (especially considering I’m a baker– yikes)?
Since then we’ve invaded each others’ apartments at least once a weekto exchange foodand hugsand storiesabout thechaos of ourdays. I guess you could say we’re officially besties.

A while back theyfed medinner when John was away. The recipe was from Smitten Kitchen’s cookbook and it was so, so delicious that it inspired me to make something similar for the blog.
The original recipe was for black bean and spaghetti squash tacos (genius, right?). The flavor and texture combination was brilliant! I had seconds, nay,thirds. I lost count. All I know is squash and black beans belong together.

Despite being made from scratch (with the exception of theblack beans and tortillas), this recipe is quite simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and a little more than an hour to prepare.
The enchilada sauce is a takeon the red sauce from myChipotle Vegan Chilaquiles (a must-try if you haven’t already!). It’s smoky and rich and pairs perfectly with the buttery sweetness of the squash.

The filling is so simple: roasted butternut squash and black beans seasoned with a few dry spices and a spoonful of the enchilada sauce. Swoon.
What happens next is magic. These enchiladas bake upbeautifully, acquiring a slight crisp on the edges while remaining completely tender on the inside.

The toppings make all the difference. I opted for ripe avocado and cilantro, but red onion would also add a burst of color and a slight crunch. Also, pumpkin seeds! The options are endless.

I hope you all love these enchiladas! They’re:
Simple
Hearty
Flavorful
Smoky
Spicy

Top with desired toppings and serve.I love fresh lime juice, red onion, avocado, and cilantro, but these enchiladas are delicious on their own! Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until warmed through."

Can I talk to you about salad, and also, life?
First, salad. No one should be forced to have aconversation on an empty stomach.

This salad is an adaptationof one I’ve been making recently for friends when hosting. It’s so simple in nature you likely already have most of the ingredients on hand right now (the best kind of recipe, in my opinion).
Peppery arugula is combinedwith crisp apples, toasted pecans, red onion, and dried cranberries, and it’s all dressed with a bright, vibrant lemon vinaigrette.
Plus, just15minutes(!!) and 8basic ingredientsto prepare – my idea of salad perfection.
This would make the perfect light and healthy dishto help you fill up on plantsand erase some of that pie guilt likely lingering from yesterday’s feast. We’ve all been there. Salad to the rescue.

Now, life.
This time of year, everyone tellsyou tobe thankful for what you have. I agree. Slow down, be grateful– it’s good for thesoul.
But what about when life is hard, or things don’t go the way youplanned, or something happensand your sense of reality shifts? What then?
2015 was perhaps my most personally challenging year yet, one wherein things didn’t go ‘as planned’ for me.I was left feeling a little sad and angry and frustrated and just generally not like myself (what a bizarre sensation). It allmade me realize I’m not as strong or spontaneous or resilient as I thought I was.In short, this year kind of kicked my ass.
The gritty details aren’t the important part. The important partis I think it’s OKto besad, orangry, or disappointed, or tired, or whatever it is you’re feeling right now that’s not radiantjoy. It doesn’t mean you’re not thankful. It just means you’re giving yourself permission to feel your feelings (which is perfectly healthy, by the way).And it’s OK if what comes out isn’t all roses and sunshine.
My encouragement is, cry it out if you need to.No one’s looking anyway.And while you’re at it, eat some pie and hug your mom. I’ve found these to beequally sufficient remedies.

OK, back to this salad because, delicious.
I hope you love this recipe. It’s:
Simple
Seasonal
Fresh
Healthy
Satisfying
Flavorful
&amp; Perfect for fall + winter

432,Delicata Squash Bake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Delicata Squash Bake with Tahini Sauce

It’s officially Thanksgiving week (!!!), and I’ve got one thing on my mind: All the food.
May Ioffer upthe perfect, last-minute side dish for your holiday table?
I present thissimple delicata squash bake that’s naturally sweet and bursting with color and flavor.
And becauseI know you’re busy, this recipe takes just 30 minutes fromstart to finish. Let’s do this!

Funny story: I thought I hated delicata squash (beforeI evertried it).
I’d walk through the grocery store, eyeingthesemystifying, skinny little devils with confusion and anger. They’d stareme down andtaunt, “You don’t know how to cook us. Plus, we don’t even taste good. Stick with butternut, you’ll be better off.”
These are seriously my thoughts.

I didn’t want to like this squash. It honestly seemed too difficult to work with, and not worth the fuss. So you can imagine my anger (and relief)upon trying itfor the first time a few weeks ago and totallyloving it.
“I wasn’t supposed to like you, but then you had to go and be awesome.”
Isn’t thishowall good love stories go?

This dish is simple in nature: Baked squash, creamy tahini sauce, pomegranates, hazelnuts, and fresh parsley. It’s a symphony of texture and flavor, and utilizes some of autumn’s best produce. In other words, it’s oh-so worthy of gracingyour dinner table.
Plus, itrequires just 9 basicingredients and 30 minutes to prepare. (Double bonus.)

I hope you love this dish! It’s:
Tender
Sweet
Crunchy
Fruity
Citrusy
Satisfying
Autumnal
&amp; Simply delicious
This would make the perfect side dish for Thanksgiving, andin reality, for as long as squash and pomegranates are in season. I could even see this being a single lady dinner when John’s away (he’s not much of a sweet squash guy, which totally works out in my favor).

433,Best Vegan Apple Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Apple Crisp

I know what you’re thinking. The best apple crisp, really?
Friends, I know this is a big claim, but I’ve had a lot of apple crisps in my life and know this one tops them all! I have a discerning palette when it comes to dessert, trust me.
I cannotwait to share this recipe with you. It’s perfect for fall andwinter and will make you so many friends if you bring it along to holiday gatherings. Let’s get to it!


This recipe is simple, requiring just 1 bowl to prepare and simple ingredientsyou likely have right now. Since September, I’ve had a bowl of apples lying around constantly, which is a little dangerous now that I have this recipe on hand.
Think apple crisp once a week. Yeah, that’s probably going to happen all winter long.

This isn’tthe healthiest apple crisp, but it does have some pretty amazing things going for it.
For one, it’s naturally sweetened with muscovado and coconut sugar. It’s also vegan butter-free, and uses coconut oil (or olive oil) instead.
It’s also gluten-free optional when you use a gluten-free flour blend in place of the unbleached all purpose.

The filling is perfect. Apples are generously coated with coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and fresh ginger. Apple juice adds extra sweetnessand helps cook the apples to tender perfection, while arrowroot and cornstarch help create a thick, caramel-like sauce.
The topping is amazing as well with plenty of texture from rolled oats, almond meal, and chopped pecans. Muscovado and coconut sugar add sweetness, while cinnamon adds warmth and autumnalflavor.

Friends, this truly is the best vegan apple crisp! It’s:
Tender
Warm
Comforting
Perfectly sweet
Subtly spiced
Perfect for fall + the holidays
&amp; Insanely delicious
I made this for the first timefor a group offriends and everyone was silent as we savoredthose first few bites. Imagine tender, perfectly sweet apples in a caramel-like sauce, under perfectly crisp, pecan-oat topping. I can barely describe howdelicious it is. You absolutely must experience it for yourself!
One friend, who considers himself an apple crisp aficionado, admittedthat this version was better than his mom’s famous recipe. That’s a high compliment if you ask me.

If you give this crisp a try, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Peel apples, quarter, remove cores, and use a paring knife to thinly slice lengthwise (see photo).Add to a large mixing bowl and top with remaining filling ingredients. Toss to combine. Add to a 9x13 (or similar size // as original recipe is written // use smaller or larger is altering batch size) baking dish.Rinse and wipe out your mixing bowl and add all topping ingredients. Stir to combine, then use fingers to break down any clumps of muscovado sugar. Pour over apples in an even layer.Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour (uncovered) or until the filling is bubbly, the apples are very fork tender (especially in the center of the dish), and the topping is deep golden brown.Let rest at least 30 minutes before serving. This is delicious with coconut whipped cream or vanilla bean coconut ice cream.Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through."
434,Pumpkin Pie Parfaits | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Pie Parfaits (Vegan + GF)

Pumpkin.Pie.Parfaits!
Who needs crust anyway? It’s so last year…

This recipe iswhat I make when I wantpumpkin pie, but am impatient and don’t want to fuss with pie crust (even though I havemastered the art of thegluten-free,traditional, and coconut oil crust).
These parfaits are simple, requiring just 10 ingredients (once you’ve made your pumpkin butter+coconut whipped cream), and come together in about 1 hour. Easy peasy and so yum.
In place of the crust, I opted for a simple cinnamon-maple granola that provides a sweet crunch to the parfait.
But if you’re in a rush, you can also use your favorite store-bought granola, or try one of our seasonal flavors (thePumpkin Maple Pecan and Sweet Potato being two of my favorites).

The next two layers come in the form of ultra-creamy pumpkin butter and coconut whipped cream. Oh my word. This flavor combination is perfect.
I think Ilove it more than PB &amp; J. There, I said it.
Last but not least, maple cinnamon pecans addthe perfect sweet, crunchy finish.

I hope you all love these parfaits! They’re:
Creamy
Crunchy
Perfectly sweet
Pumpkin-y
Subtly spiced
&amp;So satisfying
These are the perfect easy dessert for fall gatherings, or in place of traditional pie atThanksgiving. Can you imagine how delicious these would be with a chai latte? Don’t even get me started.

Have you made your menu yet? Do you have big plans? Are you doing something traditional (like eatingAunt Betty’s stuffing andplaying cards with your grandpa), or something unconventional (like packingPB&amp;Js andheading tothe beach)?
Tell me everything. I want to know!

When considering what to share for Thanksgiving this year as an “entrée,” I struggled. So I went with my instincts and tried to think of something I would actually be excited to make and enjoy on the big day.
I have yet to try a vegan “loaf” or roast I actually enjoyed, and I’m not much a fan offake meats and the like. So instead of overcomplicating things, I came up with awhole foods-focused dish that’s simple, delicious, and something everyone canenjoy (picky eaters included).

Get this:
Pillowy Garlic Herb Flatbreads, filled with:
Cinnamon-roasted sweet potatoes,
Crispy baked chickpeas,
Peppery arugula,
Toastedpumpkin seeds,
Dried cranberries, &amp;
Zesty Garlic-Dill Sauce
Swoon. Oh, and it all comes together in 30 minutes with less than 10 ingredients (depending on which toppings you choose).Happy Thanksgiving, indeed.


I am so thrilled with how these turned out. They’re:

Flavorful
Savory-sweet
Slightly crisp from the arugula + seeds
Creamy + zesty from the garlic-dill sauce

This recipe is a reader request.After sharing my Chickpea Shawarma Sandwich, which is wrappedin pita bread, someone requestedI share my take ona simple, homemade flatbread recipe. I couldn’t have agreedmore! So, I got to work.

This recipe is so simple, requiring just8 ingredients,1 bowl, and easy-to-master methods. Plus, it gets a wholesome touch with the addition ofspelt flour, which adds nutrients as well asa slightly nutty flavor.
If you’ve hadany trouble makingbread in the past, flatbread is a great place to start.
For one, there’s no baking involved, which simplifies the cooking process. And once you’ve mastered the rise (and trust me, you totally can), all that’s left is rolling out the dough and cooking it on the stovetop. So easy, such incredibleresults.

Most importantly, what does it taste like? So good! It’s:
Pillowy Tender Warm Savory Garlic- + Herb-infused Satisfying &amp; Delicious

Stir with a wooden spoon to mix. Add more water as needed until a dough forms.Transfer to a clean, well-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic - about 2 minutes - adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking.Wipe out mixing bowl and add a bit of oil (1 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).

Friends, I have very important news:
1. I perfected COCONUT OILpie crust!
2. I made pumpkin pie into MINIS.
3. It’s almost Thanksgiving.
Let’s bake!

In case you haven’t seen my resource page on how to make Coconut Oil Pie Crust, go there first for all my tips, methods, and step-by-step photos. Otherwise, proceed.

This recipe is simple, requiring 10 ingredients and easy-to-mastermethods!
Plus, there’s no specialty equipment involved – just a muffin tin, blender (or food processor or whisk), rolling pin, and pastry cutter (or fork).
I wanted to keep this recipe approachable so everyone could join the fun.

Can I tell you how excited I am that I figured out coconut oil pie crust? I tried several methods without success, all requiring to chill or freeze the coconut oil before adding to the crust. But it always made the dough rock hard, which resulted in a crust that was difficult to form and cracked. Oy!
But, in a moment of despair, I finally discovered you can just use coconut oil right out of the jar for a perfectly-flaky, easy-to-work-with crust that doesn’t taste like coconut in the final product! Three cheers for this happy kitchen accident.

Once your mini crusts are formed, simply blend your filling ingredients, pour into your tins, and bake!
The real challenge? Waiting for them to cool. But trust me! It’s worth your patience. Make your coconut whipped cream to pass the time.
These pies are PERFECT. They’re:
Mini
Flaky
Pumpkin-y
Tender
Sweet
Subtly spiced
Portable
Simple
&amp; Delicious
Make these for Thanksgiving. Make these for fall parties. Make thesefor no reason at all, other than the fact that it’s November, the leaves are turning, andpumpkin pie is the best.
If you try this recipe, let us know how it goes! I love seeing your comments, ratings, and of course, your photos on Instagram with the hashtag #minimalistbaker. Cheers and happy baking, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (174 C), and see notes about coconut oil before starting.Add all pie filling ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed (it shouldn’t need anything). Set aside.To prepare crust, add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.Next add coconut oil in spoonfuls (see photo) and use a pastry cutter (or fork) to cut the two together, until it resembles wet sand - about 30-45 seconds.Add ice cold water 1 Tbsp at a time and use a wooden spoon to gently mix. Add only as much water as needed to help it come together and form a dough - about 3-4 Tbsp (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Use your hands to gently knead/form the dough in the bowl and gather any loose scraps. Then transfer directly to a well-floured surface and form into a disc with your hands.Roll out your dough into a circle about 1/4-inch thick, adding more flour if the crust sticks. Then use a large, round cookie cutter (~3 1/4-inch in diameter) to cut out as many circles as the dough will allow - you’re aiming for 12 (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and you should have more than enough dough.Dust a large wooden cutting board (or other surface) with flour, and use a spatula to scoop on one circle at a time.Lightly flour top of circle, then use your rolling pin to gently roll it out slightly larger and thinner - about 1.5 times its starting size. Be careful not to get it too thin or it will be difficult to work with.Use your spatula to lift the crust, then use your hands to drape the crust into your muffin tin, allowing the edges to fold and curl over itself to accommodate its shape (see photo). Use your hands to carefully form the crust into the tins, being careful not to stretch the dough, but rather fold and push it down to meet the tin’s shape.Repeat until all tins have been filled and most of the crust is used - reserve any leftover for future pies or other baked goods.Pour filling into pie crusts a generous 3/4 full, and use a spoon to level the top. Bake at 350 degrees F (174 C) for 40-50 minutes, or until the crust is light golden brown and the filling appears golden brown and slightly cracked on top.Remove from oven and let cool completely before serving - about 2-3 hours. Serve at room temperature, or transfer to a serving platter, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours, or overnight. Will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best when fresh.Serve as is, or with coconut whipped cream and an additional sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or pumpkin pie spice (optional). These would also be amazing with my Brown Sugar Pecans!"

What are your fall rituals?
Mine include coffee dates,pumpkin pie making, walks with this hunk, gawking atall the gorgeous fallcolors, and being cozy inside whilst reading magazines.
I also try and make it a pointto visit our local farmers markets before they close up shop forwinter (boo).

This fall, I’ve beengoing to the farmers market most Saturdays with friends, snatching up whatever looks good, and thenheading home and roasting it in the oven and calling it ‘brunch.’
My favorite roasted vegetables are sweet potatoes and red onion. Theyget all tender and caramelized and sweet and I could eat them all day every day with nothing but hummus and hot sauce. (Weird, I know.Stop judging me.)
This recipe is inspired by that vegetable combination, with the addition of kale (hooray!) and masala-spiced scrambled tofu.

Tofu scrambles used to elude me, with their complicated seasonings and methods, but now I think they’re so easyI couldmake them in my sleep!
Simply crumbleand season your tofu with a mix of smoky, spicy, and salty seasonings. My go-to spice blendhas been the tandoori masala mix from Whole Foods. It’s absolutely perfect for roasting vegetables of any kind, and especially for amplifying the flavor of tofu scrambles.
If you can’t find it, worry not! I included a DIY blend in the notes.

This recipe is simple, requiring 10ingredients (give or take a spice). Andit all happens quickly (about 45 minutes) since you prep your tofu and kale while the vegetables are roasting away.
This tofu scramble is my new favorite! It’s:
Savory
Loaded with vegetables
Hearty
Flavorful
Easy
Quick
&amp; Super satisfying
This would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast or brunch. If you aren’t into tofu, sub crispy chickpeas! Or, if you’re super lazy (like I am), just serve this with a generous spoonful of hummus and call it a meal. It doesn’t get simpler than that.

You guys, it’s November! (What!?)
Can we still pumpkin?
Please say yes. I have a lot more pumpkin enthusiasm to exert before this year is over.

This recipe is inspired by my favorite 1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread! It’s so tender, crumbly, and bursting with pumpkinflavor I couldn’t resist turning it into muffins.
And the crumb topping is a take onmy Vegan Banana Crumb Muffins, which isone ofmy favorite muffin recipes on the blog.
I took the best of both recipes to make these muffins, which are:
Vegan +gluten-free
Naturally sweetened
(Vegan) butter-free
&amp; 1 bowl-required

I worked hard to perfect the tender yet crumbly texture of the interior of these muffins, and to infuse the perfect amount of sweetness and fall spice. Mission accomplished.
The crumb topping makes these muffins, in my opinion. A mix of coconut oil, muscovado or coconut sugar, pecans, and gluten-free flour createsthe perfect crispy, sweet finish. Serious yum.

I hope you all love these muffins! They’re:
Crumbly
Tender
Pumpkin-y
Sweet
Slightly crisp from the topping
Kind of perfect
&amp; Simple
These would make the perfect take-along snack for work or school. They would also make a lovely holiday gift or dessert for fall parties. And since they’re refined sugar-free, gluten free, and vegan, everyone can enjoy.

It’s better to slightly over-bake these than under-bake because the gluten-free flour blend takes longer to cook all the way through.Let cool for 5 minutes in the muffin tin, then gently remove and cool completely on a cooling rack. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.Once completely cooled, store in a covered container at room temp for 3-4 days, though best when fresh. Freeze for longer term storage."

One of the things I initially found most challenging about eating moreplant-based meals wasactually feelingfull.
I’ve always been a quantity eater. I’m not the girl who takes takes three bites of my salad, holds my stomach, and sighs, “Oof, can’t have one more bite. It’s too much.”
Nope. Give me those last two bites and your last two bites or else. I’m hangry.

The real issue was mental. I kept thinking, “How can I possibly get full and stay full on salads, rice, and beans?”
I’ll tell you how. If youeat enough riceand beans (and other vegan protein sources), throw in a tonof vegetables, and drink plenty of water, you’ll be too full to remember what food scarcity you were ever complaining about in the first place.
In my quest to create more hearty, plant-based meals, I started to learnwhat it took to feed my body well – in both quantityandnourishment.
Dishes like myMediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes,Grillable Veggie Burgers, Roasted Sweet Potato Chickpea Salad, and Chickpea Shawarma Sandwiches began filling my plate, and over time, I realizedmeatless meals can fillme up.
My top tip for creating satiating plant-based meals is to combine several foods that are highin fiber and protein to keep you satisfied, and to create more texture inyour dish. Instead of having just tofu, throw in some healthy brown rice and vegetables! Instead of having just black beans, throw in some plantains and peppers and corn tortillas! Instead of having just quinoa, addin some beans and bell peppers!
This recipewas born out of that idea. Knowing myself, a meal of pinto beans and rice isn’texciting or filling enough for me. But when you throw in a poblano pepper (with tons of fiber and vitamins), and add a little avocado on top, I’m one satisfied eater. Let me show you how.

This recipe may look a little complex, but it’s actually quite simple. It requires just 9ingredients andeasy-to-master methods.
It starts with brown rice, amplified in flavor bysautéed onion, cilantro, cumin, and salsa. Next comes pinto beans for addedprotein and fiber. Stuff all that goodness inside poblano peppers and bake until tender. That’s it!

Toppings are optional, but I’m kind of a sauce lover myself, so I went with more salsa, cilantro, and some of my favorite Cilantro Avocado Dressing. Mmm, dreamy.

I know you guys are going to LOVE this dish! It’s:
Hearty
Satisfying
Flavorful
Warm
Comforting
Subtly spiced
Healthy
&amp; Easy to make
This would be the perfect dish for meat-eaters and vegans alike!It proves how simple and possible it is to get full and nourished onmeatless meals.

Get your chips ready, friends. We’re about to embark on a queso adventure.

If you’ve followed our blog for a while now, you probably already know aboutmy favorite queso recipe, which is made without cashews and with eggplant instead!
That recipe still has my heart because it usesan entire vegetable in place of butter and cheese and whatever else goes into conventional queso dip. Healthy swaps for the win.
But,sometimes you don’t want vegetables in your “cheese” dip. Sometimes you just want creamy, buttery goodness that’s a little more on the indulgent side.
If that’s the case, then this is the dip for you.

The base is garlic, vegan butter (or oil of choice), unbleached all-purpose flour, and plain almond milk. This roux creates a thick, creamy, undetectably-vegan dip.
Next comes nutritional yeast for that “cheesy” flavor andmild green chilis for heat.
Blend it all together to create the mostcreamy, luxurious queso dip you’ve ever seen.

Guess what? It’s simple! This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and about 20 minutes to make, so you’ll be out the door and on your way to the party with dip in no time.

I hope you guys love this queso! It’s:
Creamy
Velvety
“Cheesy”
Spicy
Warm
Gooey
&amp; Perfect for dipping
Ready your tortilla chips. This is the perfect dip for Mexican night, sportsgames, nachos, and more. Serve it alongside my 7-Layer Mexican Dip and watch people swoon.

Happy Halloweeeen!
Are you dressing up? Are you going to parties? Are you eating all the candy?
Might I suggest a savory dip to offset all the sweetness that’s sure toensue?
I present butternut squash hummus! It’s like fall on a pita chip. Who wouldn’t want that?

This dip comes together in about 30 minutes with 10 basic ingredients.
It gets its flavor from both roasted and fresh garlic, lemon juice, parsley, smoky cumin, paprika, and a pinch of cinnamon. This hummusis bursting with autumnal flavor and is absolutely perfect with some whole grain pita chips and roasted carrots (simple recipe below!).

This hummus is crazy delicious. It’s:
Savory
Creamy
Smoky
Subtly spiced
Slightly sweet from the squash
&amp; Lemony
This is the perfect dip to have on hand for a week of healthy snacking. It would also be great for entertaining or taking along to parties. Or, if you’re like me and you eat hummus for breakfast, it’s especially delicious with roasted broccolini and breakfast potatoes. Not weird, trust me.

443,White Bean Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Bean Kale Salad with Tahini Dressing

I think there’s something wrong with me. I’ve started to crave kale.
If I haven’t had it in two days, I get something like a twitch. I need a dark, leafy greens fix STAT.
Most mornings, I have a green smoothie loaded with kale and spinach. And if I’m feeling especially healthy, I whip up a Roasted Sweet Potato Chickpea Kale Salad for lunch or dinner. Oh, and Cheesy Kale Chips – they usually call my name around 3 p.m.
This is not me bragging about my healthydiet. This is me confessing that I think I have an addiction. Halp.

In all seriousness, I love that I love leafy greens! I know it’s an acquired taste for some. The first time I tried kale was in a smoothie that wasn’t properly blended and I swore I’d never trythe bitter, tough greenagain.
Fast forward to today and I literally pick the kale that’s meant for garnish off John’s dinner plate likeit’s the last bite of chocolate cake on the table.
This salad takes my kale obsession even further. I addedin white beans, some garlic croutons, and dressed it in a simple tahini dressing. Friends, it’s like a flavor explosion in the mouth. I (literally) think I’m in love.

It starts with a little kale massage to break down the texture and remove some of the bitterness. Olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and maple syrup infuse flavor before the dressing even goes on.
If your salad tastes delicious on its own, you don’t need as much dressing! That’s my number one kale salad tip. Pre-season – it’ll get you far in life.

Next come white beans tossed in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and fresh parsley.
And whileall of this is happening, roast up some simple garlic croutons and whip up my 5-ingredient tahini dressing. It’s like liquid gold as far as I’m concerned. I rarely deviate from this dressing these days. It’s become my absolute favorite for every kind of salad.

I hope you guys love this salad! It’s:
Super quick (30 minutes)
Simple (with basic ingredients)
Loaded with lemon-garlic flavor
Creamy +sweet, thanks to the tahini dressing
Loaded with fiber + protein (15 g protein per serving!)
Satisfying + healthy
&amp; Perfect for weeknight meals and hosting
I think this salad is perfect forwhen you’re craving something substantial but nutrient-rich. I personally love big kale salads for lunchbecause it means I’ve already gotten in nearly all of my vegetables servings before dinner, leaving lots of room for things like pizza and ice cream. Let’s be real – I eat greens so I can have pizza and dessert.

At this point, you’re probably thinking I have a thing for spaghetti squash.
If you think that, you are correct. How could you not love a vegetable that tastes like pasta? SQUASH PASTA!
I believe I’ve made my case.

After pairing spaghetti squash with basil pesto, I knewa lasagna-inspired dish with my favorite tofu ricotta would be amazing. Tofu ricotta + marinara sauce = flavor match made in heaven. It’s science.

In addition to being incredibly flavorful, this recipe is also simple, requiringjust 10 ingredients. And it’s naturally gluten-free and vegan, so everyone can enjoy.

So what’s it taste like? Kind of amazing. It’s:
Savory
“Cheesy”
Tomato-y
Hearty
Rich
&amp; Comforting
Despite being so hearty, it’sprettylight and healthy since the “pasta” is actually a vegetable. Plus,the tofu ricotta provides tons of protein, with 10 grams per serving! This would make the perfect weeknight meal to feed your family or to entertain a crowd. It would pair especially well with my Kumquat Kale Salad with Tahini Dressingor my Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Tandoori Chickpeas.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet with foil.Carefully halve your spaghetti squash lengthwise using a sharp knife. I find the best way is to pierce the skin with the very tip of the knife and push it all the way through to the other side. Rock the knife back and forth to cut one half all the way through, then repeat on the other side.Use an ice cream scoop (or sharp spoon) to scrape out the seeds and most of the stringy parts. It should appear pretty clean.Brush the interior with oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Place cut-side down on baking sheet. Roast for 45 minutes, or until a knife easily pierces the skin and flesh. Remove from oven and set aside to cool slightly. Also reduce oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).In the meantime, add all tofu filling ingredients to a food processor or blender and pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed. You are looking for a semi-pureed mixture with bits of basil still intact.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for brightness.Once fully baked and slightly cooled, use a fork to scoop out spaghetti squash into fine strings. Set aside.Lightly grease a 9x13-inch (or similar size // as original recipe is written // adjust size/number if altering batch size) baking dish and lay down 1/3 of the squash. Top with several spoonfuls of tofu ricotta, then pour on a layer of marinara sauce. Repeat until all ricotta filling and marinara is used up - about 3 layers. Make sure the top layer is sauce.Loosely cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C). Then remove foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown. Cover with foil if the squash is browning too quickly.Let cool briefly, then serve with desired toppings (listed above). I prefer red pepper flakes and vegan parmesan cheese. Fresh basil adds a nice pop of color.Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.

First up,oats (!), which you already sawif you follow me on Instagram. And if you don’t follow me there, like, why not?

This recipe is all kinds of simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutesto prepare.
Steel cut oats make a fiber- and protein-rich base, pumpkin butter and pumpkin pie spice add autumnal flavor, andcoconut sugar (or maple syrup) adds natural sweetness. That’s right – these PIE oats are naturally sweetened! It’s too good to be true.

446,Vegan Singapore Noodles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Singapore Noodles

It’s rare that I receive arequestfor a recipe I’ve never heard of. But that’s exactly what happened recently when a reader wrote in requesting I remake her and her husband’s favorite takeout dish: Singapore noodles.
What? The description sounded amazing! How hadI never known aboutthis unique dish?
After trying it for myself, I’m an instant convert. Drop what you’re doing, and get on board. Let’s venture into uncharted (delicious food) territory together!

Singapore noodles isn’t necessarily a dish that originatedin Singapore. I liken it to one of the manyChineserestaurant menu itemsI orderthat likelyaren’t traditionalChinese dishes at all.
No matter the origin or history of this dish, what you need to know is this:
It’s like a cross between curry and pad Thai.
It’s got noodles.
It’s got vegetables.
Its flavor comes froma tangy-sweet sauce +curry powder.
It’s insanely delicious.
Ya dig?

Based on my research, there are some not-so-common ingredients in Singapore noodles like Shaoxing wine and fish sauce that I didn’t want to a) hunt down, and b) attemptto veganize.
So I crossed my fingers, tried making it without them, and (much to my surprise) discovered you don’t really need them at all.
With thatbeing said, this is my inspired version. SinceI don’t havean authentic version to compare it to, this might not match your favorite restaurant’sversion. But, what I can promiseis that this recipe is surprisingly easy, intensein flavor, and 100% delicious.

Speaking of easy to make, this recipe requires just 10 ingredients (11 if adding tofu!) and about 30 minutes to prepare. Another perk? You likely have the ingredients in your kitchenright now:
Rice noodles (thin or vermicelli)
Onion
Red pepper
Snow peas
Curry powder
Soy sauce (or tamari)
Lime juice
Garlic
Coconut sugar
Sesame Oil
(Tofu – optional)
While most of the recipes I foundincluded pork or shrimp, I kept mine vegan by simply leaving these out. But I must say, the addition of mycrispy, baked tofu adds extra protein and texture and takes this recipe to a whole new level of awesome.
I think you guys are going to love this dish! It’s:
Flavorful
Satisfying
Comforting
Curry-infused
Slightly spiced
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Quick
Keep this recipe on hand for easy, fastweeknight meals. I also think it’d be great for entertaining a crowd, especially if you have vegan andgluten-free friends.

Then taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You’re going for a savory-tart sauce with a bit of sweetness (adjust to taste). Set aside.Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add half of the toasted sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), onion and red bell pepper. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is soft and translucent.Add snow peas, 1 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce, and 2 tsp curry powder, and stir (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).

Sauté for 1 minute, tossing frequently with tongs to disperse sauce and curry powder.Add back in the vegetables and toss to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, then remove from heat.Serve with desired toppings.

I officially have a “casserole” on Minimalist Baker. My grandmothers would be so proud.

Is it too early to start dreaming up my Thanksgiving menu?Please say no.
If I’m being honest, I look most forward to three things at Thanksgiving:
Dinner rolls
Pumpkin pie
&amp;the sweet potato dish (in any and all forms)
Are you surprised they’re all sugar and carbs? I’m not.

This may technically be a sweet potato casserole, but it’s my modern take.
For one, there’s little-to-no (vegan) butter involved.
Second, it’s naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar.
Third, I added butternut squash for true autumnalflavor.
Lastly, I replaced the marshmallows with coconut sugar-toasted pecans.
I think your Aunt Sally would still be proud if you brought this to the dinner table, even though it’s hippie-approved.
Plus, it’s simple requiring just 10 basic ingredients and about 1 hour to prepare.

Most importantly, it tastes amazing. It’s:
Buttery
Slightly crunchy
Perfectly sweet
Cinnamon-infused
Satisfying
&amp; Simple
Though I created this recipewith Thanksgiving in mind, it’s ideal for so many other occasions. I could see this as a side dish at fall gatherings and weeknight meals alike, or even as a fall and winter brunch item.

Much to my surprise, I actually really liked it. The texture of spaghetti squash is tender and the flavor is subtle, lending itself extremely well to pasta sauce and pesto.
I still don’t buyinto the low-carb thing, because, bread. But I am a fan of eating more vegetables whenever possible. So, spaghetti squash pasta it is!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients. Plus,it comes together with minimal effort in about 1 hour!
My first idea was to make a white sauce, but it ended up being too heavy for the delicate texture of the squash. Back to the drawing board.
My second thoughtwas to make a vegan pesto with sun-dried tomato, and I was so happy with the results! This pesto is full of flavor and distributes beautifully throughout the “noodles,” for a light-yet-satisfying dish.
You know it’s a success when you go in for a sample bite, and it’s so good you just sit down and callit a meal.

I hope you all love this dish. It’s:
Savory
Simple
Light
Satisfying
Loaded with flavor
&amp; Perfect for fall
This would make the perfect quick weeknight meal when you’re craving something comforting but not too heavy. It generously serves two as an entrée (with nearly 11 grams protein!) or four as a side dish.
If you’re looking for extrastaying power, pair the squash with my chickpea bolognese instead! I can’t even explain how delicious that combo would be.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet (or more if increasing batch size) with foil.Carefully halve spaghetti squash lengthwise using a sharp knife. I find the best way is to pierce the skin with the very tip of the knife and push it all the way through to the other side. Rock the knife back and forth to cut one half all the way through, then repeat on the other side. Use an ice cream scoop (or sharp spoon) to scrape out the seeds and most of the stringy parts.Brush the interior with oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Place cut-side down on baking sheet. Roast for 45 minutes, or until a knife easily pierces the skin and flesh. Remove from oven and set aside.In the meantime, add cashews, pine nuts, nutritional yeast, and sea salt to a blender or food processor and pulse until a fine meal.Add basil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and olive oil and puree into a fine paste. If it has trouble mixing, add a bit more oil or hot water (2-3 Tbsp // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to help encourage it along. It doesn’t need to be finely pureed, just well-mixed. A bit of texture is a good thing in this dish. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Use a fork to scoop out spaghetti squash into fine strings and divide between serving plates. Top with desired amount of pesto and lightly toss.Serve with additional toppings as desired (listed above). I prefer red pepper flakes and vegan parmesan cheese.Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best when fresh. Pasta can be enjoyed hot, chilled, or at room temperature."

In all of the cashewcheesecakeexperimentation I’ve done so far on the blog, I haven’t touched on pumpkinyet. Thingshad to change!

These pumpkin cheesecakes were the first thing that came to mind when I thought of creating a simple-yet-decadent fall dessert.
I mean, who doesn’t love cheesecake? Andpumpkin? Andcoconut whipped cream?
(If you’re raising your hand at this point, you can just leave.)

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and no specialspringform pans or gadgets.
If you have a blender, parchment paper (or cupcakeliners), and ramekins (or muffin tins), you can master these decadent vegan cheesecakes!

I think you all are going to love these gems. They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Pumpkin-infused
Subtly spiced
Not too sweet
&amp; Satisfying
These would make the perfect dessert for holiday parties and fall gatherings. They’re superversatile with the ability to be made in muffin tins for a single-serving size, ramekins for 3-4 small cheesecakes, or around cake pan (or springform pan) for one large cheesecake to feed a crowd. Top with coconut whipped cream and brown sugar pecans (recipes below) for a finishing touch.

","Cover cashews with boiling-hot water. Let rest, uncovered, at room temperature for 1 hour. Then drain thoroughly and set aside.In the meantime, add dates to a blender and blend until small bits remain, or it forms a ball. Remove and set aside.Add walnuts and salt to blender and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If too crumbly, add a few more dates. If too sticky, add more crushed walnuts. Set aside.If using a springform pan, line with parchment paper. If using ramekins or muffin tins, cut parchment paper into circles the size of the base of your ramekins or muffin tins. Also, cut out two long strips of parchment paper per ramekin and lay them in an ""X"" shape at the base. Top with circle shape. This creates little tabs that make removing the cheesecakes easier to pop out once set. (For muffin tins, you can also just use cupcake liners.)Divide crust evenly among ramekins or tins (or springform pan), and press down with fingers to evenly distribute. Use a small glass wrapped in parchment paper, or the back of a spoon, to press down firmly, allowing some crust to come up the sides. Set in freezer.Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to blender with remaining filling ingredients and puree until very smooth - 2-3 minutes. If it has trouble blending add a touch more coconut milk (or almond milk). Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed.Divide filling evenly among the ramekins or tins (or pour into a parchment-lined springform pan). Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze until firm - about 4-6 hours, depending on size of dish.Once set, run a butter knife along the edge and gently remove by tugging on the tabs in an upward motion. They should pop right out. If they aren't quite set, pop them back in the freezer until firm. If using a springform pan, simply pop open and remove cheesecake.Serve with a touch of coconut whipped cream and brown sugar pecans (optional | recipe links above).Store leftovers in the freezer for 7-10 days, though best when enjoyed within the first 3-4 days. Let thaw at room temperature 15-20 minutes before serving for best texture."

Remember returning to a new school yearas a kid? Whenthe air gotcrisp and you were embarking on a new chapter oflife? It was terrifying and exciting and wonderful all at the same time.
That feeling hasbeen ingrainedin mesince childhood, and no matter how many years away I getfrom being inschool, I still get swept up in the mysterious wonderthat is this time of year. I get all inspired andsentimentaland reinvigorated to do what I love most. Does that happen to you, or am I the only one?

One of my most favorite things about Octoberis playingaround with fall flavors – especially pumpkin.
I’ve been wanting to make pumpkin butter for the blog for a while now. Have you ever triedit? If not, you must.
It’s a fall stapleinour house, with its pumpkin-y goodness, buttery texture, blend of warm spices, and subtle sweetness. Think pumpkin pie fillingin a jar, but somehow better!

","Add all ingredients to a large saucepan or pot over medium-high heat and stir to combine.Once it begins bubbling, reduce heat to low and simmer. You’re looking for a frequent bubble, so if there isn’t much going on at the surface, increase heat to medium-low heat. If bubbling too vigorously, reduce heat to low.Cook, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This is 20-minute pumpkin butter, but if you have more time, leaving it on the stove for another 5-10 minutes will only deepen the flavors and thicken the texture. However, 20 minutes was about perfect!Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweetness, lemon juice for acidity, cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice for warmth, or salt to balance the flavors.Once cooled completely, transfer to a large glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, sometimes more (depending on the freshness of your ingredients). Freeze for 1 month.Pumpkin butter is a delicious addition to fall goodies like waffles, pancakes, pumpkin bread, butternut squash banana bread, or oatmeal! Enjoy straight from the fridge, or let it warm to room temperature before adding to items like waffles or pancakes."

Quinoa? In granola? Yes.
Why have I never tried this before?
After makingmy Dark Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl, I had extraquinoa to play with so I figured another breakfast recipe was in order – my favorite.
I’d remembered seeing that it’s possible to add quinoa (raw) to granola! How coolis that?
The result is a crispy, crunchy, nutrient-packed granola that’s simple, healthy, and delicious.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 7 ingredients you likely already have in your pantry right now.
Plus, it’s naturally sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrup, and it’s (vegan) butter-free, thanks to coconut oil.
This may be a big statement, but I think this may be my favorite granola yet! And that’s saying a lot considering how many granola recipes I’ve made for Minimalist Baker. Although the sweet potato and peanut butter come in a close secondand third…

I hope you guys love this granola. It’s:
Crispy
Crunchy

454,Harissa Eggplant Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky Harissa Eggplant Dip

Happy October, friends! We officiallymade it to pumpkin season (yay!), and everything else that’s wonderful about this time of year.
Do you have any exciting plans this month? Are you visiting a pumpkin patch, an apple orchard, or making all of the pies? I hope so.
This month is an exciting one for us as we’re travelingto Europe with friends. We’ll be visiting Greece, Croatia, and Poland, as well as a couple cities for brief stopovers (follow along on Instagram!). I’m rather excited, as Greece has been one of countries I’ve been wanting to visit for years now (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, anyone?).
I hope it’s dreamy and beautifuland everything I’ve imagined it to be. If not, we’ll at least eat lots of yummy food and come home with new experiences and stories.

Speaking of travel, this dip is inspired by a recent trip we took to Seattle.
We met a new friendto explore the city’s food sceneand, of all the dishes we shared, I must say the smoky eggplant dip we had at a little wine bar was my favorite.
One biteofthis creamy, smoky, deep red eggplant dip and I was hooked. I asked the waiter about the ingredients (as I often do), and I tried to make mentalnote of everything he said.

Once I got home, I started experimenting and it only took me a couple of tries to nail it! I’m super pleased with the results and hope you will be, too.
This dip is not only extremely delicious, it’s also quite simple to make, requiring just 9 ingredients and about1 hour to prepare.
If you’ve tried any of my other eggplant dishes (thePersian Eggplant Dip, Simple Baba Ganoush, Caramelized Onion Mac n Cheese, or Cashew-less Vegan Queso), you’re familiar with my go-to cooking method of slicing, salting to remove bitterness, and then roasting. I’ve found it’s the best way to get that roasted, smoky flavor without cooking your eggplant over an open flame (which is idealfor those of us without a fire pit or gas stove).
Next comes smoked paprika, harissa paste, and roasted garlic fordepth of flavor and a little heat, as well as some lemon juice to bringbrightness and acidity.

The result is the dip of my dreams. It’s:
Creamy
Savory
Smoky
Spicy
Insanely flavorful
&amp; Perfect for fall
This dip is best served with toasted pita chips or whole grain bread to offset the creaminess, though vegetables are a great gluten-free option as well. Make this dip as an appetizer for fall parties, a healthy snack, or even to use as a sandwich spread.

I’m typically an oats or granola fan, but the amount of protein and staying power in quinoa is hard to ignore – 1 cup cooked contains about 8 grams protein, 5 grams fiber, and tons of iron and magnesium! I can’t think of a better way to start the day.

In addition to being nutrient-dense, this breakfast bowlisalso naturally sweetened with maple syrup and rich with antioxidantsthanks to cocoa powder. Fresh fruit and a square of dark chocolate make the perfect toppings.

Do you ever have one of those days where nothing seems to be going right?
I had one of those days recently when I was making these granola bars, partially because of mythree failed attempts at this recipe! Yes, three.
Who fails at granola bars? I do.

I desperately wanted to make baked granola bars. Doesn’t it just sound dreamy?
Well, you know what happens when you bake granola bars (at least in my experience)? They become dry and crumbly, and you’re left with a big pan of granola – not what I’mgoing for. Any advice on this matter? I’d love to know.
In the meantime, back to the drawing board.

Instead of giving up altogether (which I did consider), I looked back on my favorite granola bar recipe for a little inspiration and found just what I needed.
There’s no need to bake your granola bars once they’re formed in the pan. The only baking requiredis for toasting the oats and nuts to give them more flavor and crunch. Dates provide the “glue” to hold these together and keep them 100% naturally sweetened.
The best part?This recipe is simple: 8 ingredients, 20 minutes (plus chilling), and easy-to-mastermethods.

These granola bars areeverything I’d hoped for! They’re:
Super crunchy
Speckled with oats + coconut
Peanut buttery

I’m sureyou’re probably thinking, ‘What the heck is arancini?’Great question.
Arancini is an Italian dish consisting of rice balls stuffed with cheese, coated in bread crumbs, and deep fried. The result is a crispy, savory ball of goodness with acheesy center, perfect for dipping intomarinara sauce.
Pretty awesome, right? I thought so, too. Which is precisely why I wanted to experience them for myself.
To the experimental vegan kitchen we go!

This recipe starts with cauliflower. Did you know this cruciferous vegcan be made into rice? So cool.
I wanted to usecauliflower rice as the base to keep this dish lighter and healthier. Spoiler alert: It totally worked.

The flavor in this 10-ingredient dish comes from vegan parmesan cheese (my trusty kitchen companion), sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic. Panko bread crumbs createthe perfect coating for browning and crisping the edges.

What do they taste like? Little bites of Italian food heaven. They’re:
Savory
Flavorful
Tender on the inside
Crispy on the outside
Satisfying
&amp; Surprisingly healthy
Think Italian vegan“meatball,” but only more tender and somehow more delicious.
These make the perfect side dish or appetizer for Italian night or when you want a heartysnack. I would bet money that kids would gobble these down without guessing they were eating mostly cauliflower. Sneaky vegetable placement for the win.

458,Butternut Squash Veggie Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butternut Squash Veggie Pizza

I rarelyspeak of love when it comes to pizza. Don’t get me wrong. I really, really like it, but pizza is pizza as far as I’m concerned.Nothing too special – it’s bread, sauce, and toppings.
But this pizza? Totally swoon-worthy becauseit all starts with a buttery, bright orange butternut squash (!!!) sauce.

This recipe is inspired bymy favorite slice at Hot Lips Pizza in Portland (see our full Portland Dining Guide here!).
Their offeringschange from time to time, but the one constant is thebutternut squash sauce. I wasn’t sure what to think at first, but it was love at first bite. The butternut squash createsa creamy, buttery, savory-sweet base that I adore. And that’s saying a lot from a die-hard tomato sauce addict!
Bonus? It’s just 5 ingredients and simple to make.

Once your sauce is made, it’s onto the veggies and crust.
I typically go for store-bought pizza dough because it’s so easy and keeps this recipe to just 10 ingredients. But feel free to make your own if you prefer (find our gluten free version here). The real magic is in the sauce.

For toppings, I went with broccolini, red onion, and chickpeas for a little added protein and fiber.
I also tried vegan mozzarella cheese on this pie, but I still prefer my homemade Vegan Parmesan Cheese! It’s literally the best and saves my dairy-free life when it comes toItalian food.

I am in LOVE with this pizza. It’s:
Flavorful
Fall-inspired
The perfect balance of savory +sweet
Loaded with veggies
Satisfying
&amp; Simple

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven.Add cubed butternut squash and peeled garlic cloves to a baking sheet and drizzle with half of the olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and a pinch each salt and pepper. Toss to combine.Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until all squash is fork tender.Transfer squash and garlic to a blender or food processor with remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and maple syrup. Purée until creamy and smooth, adding more olive oil or a touch of water if it's too thick. The consistency should be creamy and spreadable (not pourable).Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

459,Toasted Pumpkin Muesli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Toasted Pumpkin Muesli

What do you guys think? Is it too early for pumpkin things?
Please sayno, because I’ve patiently been waiting forfall to arrive, and for me, it’s close enough. Ican’t containmy excitement any longer.
Let’s get seasonal!
I’ve made muesli bread before (serious yum) but have never gone aboutmaking it into a traditional cereal. I figured I at least owed you all that much, especially considering I’ve nearly exhausted all flavors ofgranola (story of my life).
Muesli is similar togranola, onlyit’s typically unsweetened, includes no oil, and it’s raw. But for me, the idea of raw oatsisn’t too appealing(unless they’re soaked overnight). So, I went for a light toast to add more flavor and crunch.

This recipe comes together in 20 minutes and requires less than 10 ingredients.
Plus, it’s healthy! With no added sugar or oil, it’s the perfect way to start your day with plenty of fiber, healthy fats, and protein (nearly 9 grams protein per 1/2 cup).

The addition of dried fruit addssubtlesweetness, whilepumpkin pie spice and pepitas infuse plenty of fall flavor.
I can hardly contain myself with pumpkin pie spice. I’ll be putting it on everything from now until Christmas – noteven kidding.

","Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C).Arrange oats, pumpkin seeds, almonds, and sunflower seeds on baking sheet and spread into an even layer. If any of your nuts or seeds are already roasted, do not add them to the pan and reserve to add later.Bake for 10-15 minutes or until lightly toasted and golden brown, stirring once at the halfway point.Remove from oven and cool slightly. Then add to a large mixing bowl.Add all remaining ingredients: hemp seeds, chia seeds (optional), dried fruit (optional), cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. Toss to combine.Serve muesli with dairy-free milk or yogurt. Fresh fruit goes a long way with this muesli since there's no added sweeteners otherwise. I prefer mine with almond milk, banana, raspberries, and a sprinkle of coconut sugar to taste.To further soften the oats, heat milk before adding to muesli. Alternatively, cover with dairy-free milk of choice and allow to soak for 30 minutes at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator overnight."

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees (190 C) and add flax egg to a food processor or high speed blender.Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add lesser amount of olive oil (1 Tbsp or 15 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and minced garlic. Sauté until slightly browned, stirring often - about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly, then add to food processor or blender with flax egg.Next add panko bread crumbs, parsley, vegan parmesan cheese, sesame seeds (optional), coconut sugar, turmeric, cumin, a pinch each salt + pepper, and 1 tsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and lemon juice. Pulse/blend until small bits remain, scraping down sides as needed.Next, add rinsed/dried chickpeas and blend/pulse until a moldable “dough” is formed, scraping down sides as needed. You don’t want the chickpeas to turn into a paste, but you also don’t want any left whole.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more vegan parmesan and salt. Add more panko bread crumbs if the mixture feels too wet. You want them to be very flavorful, so season liberally.To make the coating, mix vegan parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl. Set aside.Scoop out heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of dough (I used this 1.5 Tbsp scoop from Amazon) and form/roll into balls - about 15 total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). They can be fragile, so handle gently.Roll fritters in the vegan parmesan cheese-panko bread crumb mixture to coat.Heat the same skillet you used earlier over medium heat. Once hot, add enough oil to form a thin layer on the bottom of the skillet, then add fritters. Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to cook them in two batches as to not crowd the pan. Add more oil as needed.Brown fritters for 4-5 minutes total, shaking the pan to roll them around and brown all sides. Turn down heat slightly if browning too quickly.Add sautéed fritters to a bare or foil-lined baking sheet and transfer to the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes.At this time, prepare any vegetables, sides and/or desired sauces, such as the Garlic Dill Sauce (link above).Once fritters are golden brown and fairly firm to the touch, remove from oven. Let cool a few minutes before serving. They will firm up the longer they cool.To serve, top pita or lettuce wraps with desired number of fritters (2-3), fresh tomato, onion, parsley, and sauce.Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a 350-degree (176 C) F oven until warmed through, or in the microwave.To freeze, sauté fritters as instructed, then transfer to a baking sheet and freeze until completely firm.

462,Vanilla Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream

Have I ever told you I used to subsist on ice cream as a child? Because I totally did.
Imagine 7-year-old mesneaking in a twist coneevery chance I got (and believe me,Igot a lot of chances).
The funny thing is I was lactose intolerant for the better part of my early childhood, which means somewhere along the line I decided I was going to eat dairy anyway and I don’t think my parents had theheart to tell meno. So ice cream it was, until several years ago when my bodyshut the whole operation down. Sad day.
Good news, though – I don’t even miss it anymore! Especially not with dairy-free alternatives like vegan parmesan cheese, coconut whipped cream, and ice creams like this one that are classic, creamy, and undetectably vegan!


I’ve been wanting to make a vanilla coconutice cream for a long time now, seeing as I’ve only done flavors up to this point (see all of them here).
This version is so simple and quite possibly my favorite yet! It requires just 5 basic ingredients and simple methods. There’s even anoption for those of you who don’t own an ice cream maker in the notes.
I went cashew-less here to highlight the coconut flavor and stuck to the basics:
Coconut milk
Vanilla bean
Vanilla extract
Organic cane sugar
Sea salt

This ice cream just screams vanilla, infused with both vanilla bean and vanilla extract. Not only does this combination addmore flavor, the extract (which typically contains alcohol) helps prevent ice crystals.
The result is theperfectcreamy, dreamy coconut ice cream.

You’re going to LOVE this ice cream.It’s:
Super creamy
Coconutty
Vanilla-infused
Perfectly sweet
Simple
Classic
&amp; Delicious
This is the perfect ice cream to make when you want a basic non-dairy ice cream. It pairs well with cake, pie, would make a killer ice cream sandwich, and makes the ultimate base for vegan milkshakes (new recipe coming soon!).

","The day or night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill (see notes if you don't have an ice cream maker).The following day, add coconut milk, organic cane sugar (sub up to half with natural sweetener), sea salt, scraped vanilla bean and vanilla extract to a high-speed blender and blend on high until completely creamy and smooth for 1-2 minutes to fully dissolve the sugar. Add more cane sugar or agave if it needs more sweetness, or more vanilla if it needs more vanilla flavor.Add mixture directly to chilled ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve (see photo). See notes if you don't have a churner.Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a large freezer-safe container (such as a loaf pan) and use a spoon to smooth the top.Cover securely and freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm. Set out for 5-10 minutes before serving to soften - a hot ice cream scoop also eases scooping.Will keep in the freezer for up to 10 days, though best when fresh.

Truffles are one of those desserts I can’t resist. In college I had ahabitofstopping into our university bookstore between classes to pick up a bag of roasted almonds and a dark chocolate truffle. I also had a thing for individually wrapped bubble gum, but that’s another story.
These days myindulgence of choiceisa square ofdark chocolate, but any timetruffles are around you know I’m enjoying at least two (or twelve).

","Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl. The finer the chocolate is chopped, the easier it will melt and the quicker the truffle-making process will go.In a separate small mixing bowl, add coconut milk and microwave until very warm but not boiling - about 25 seconds (alternatively, heat in a small saucepan over medium heat until just starting to simmer).Immediately add coconut milk to chocolate and loosely cover with a cooking lid or towel to trap the heat in. Do not touch for 5 minutes. Then lift cover and use a mixing spoon to gently stir, trying not to incorporate air. Continue stirring until completely melted, creamy, and smooth.NOTE: If, for some reason, you have unmelted pieces left, you can microwave the mixture in 10-second increments until completely smooth (just be careful not to overcook or it can affect the integrity of the chocolate).Add vanilla at this time and stir (optional).Set the mixture in the refrigerator to chill uncovered for 2-3 hours, or until almost completely solid. A good test is dipping a knife into the middle of the bowl to see if any chocolate sticks. If it comes out mostly clean, it’s ready to scoop. If there’s still wet chocolate in the center, continue refrigerating.Once chilled and firm, prepare a small dish of cocoa or cacao powder for rolling (optional).Use a Tablespoon-sized scoop (such as this one from Amazon) or a Tablespoon to scoop out small balls (see photo), then use your hands to gently but quickly roll/form the chocolate into balls.Toss in cocoa or cacao powder to coat and shake off excess (or leave bare), then set on a parchment-lined serving dish. Continue until all chocolate is scooped. There should be about 16 truffles (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), depending on the size of your scoop.If any of the chocolate near the center of the bowl was too soft to form, refrigerate that portion for a bit longer before proceeding.Enjoy truffles immediately, or refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight. This allows them to set and firm up.Store truffles covered in the refrigerator for best freshness. To serve, let come to room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving for optimum creaminess."

Yes, ramen that’s (undetectably) vegan and totallydoable.
Get your soup bowls, friends. It’s happening!
While I was doing some freelance work in Kansas last year, John visited Japan and ate his way through Tokyo (jealous much?). One of his favorite dishes was ramen, which he has been on the hunt for stateside ever since.
While several restaurants in Portland offer a great bowl oframen, most of them are not vegan-friendly. So I wanted to try my hand at this somewhat complicated, soul-warmingsoup.
Spoiler alert? Itturned out to be not that complicated at all!

This 10-ingredient recipe starts with the broth.
Ramen broth can be made many different ways, but to keep mine vegan-friendly I went with vegetable broth infused with ginger, onion, garlic and dried shiitake mushrooms (which you can find at most grocery (and all Asian) stores).
To add more depth and that“umami” flavor, I also added a bit of soy (or tamari) sauce and white miso paste.
The result was magic. Friends, I think I’m in love.

While your broth simmers, prepare any desired toppings.
I went with 10-minute flash “fried” crispy tofu, miso-glazed carrots, and baby bok choy. Green onions also providea colorful, crunchy finish, while chili garlic sauce addsheat.
I hope you allLOVEthishearty, satisfying, simpleramen soup!Make the broth ahead of time and enjoy individual servingsthroughout the week, orenjoyall four bowlswithfamily orfriends. Either way, you win.

Use a whisk (or wooden spoon) to scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom to enhance the flavor of the broth.Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated mushrooms - stir.Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2-3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the miso paste at this time.When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots, baby bok choy, and quick-seared tofu).NOODLES: Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size of pan you may need to do this in two batches // use fewer or more batches if altering batch size) and cook according to package instructions - about 4-5 minutes. Drain and set aside.Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I discarded them).To serve, divide ramen noodles between four (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, green onion, or seared tofu. Serve with chili garlic sauce (found here) for added heat.Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separately) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and in the freezer for up to 1 month."

But sometimes, nothing quite satisfies like a classic, heartyItalian dish, and this meatball recipeis exactly that(you know, minus the meat, eggs, and cheese).

These meatballs are inspired by my Sun-dried Tomato and Basil Pinwheelsand adapted from my Simple Vegan Meatballs.

And, as always, this recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients, simple methods, and less than 1hour to prepare.

Once you formthe meatballs,it’s just a matter ofcoating, sautéing and finishing them off in the oven while you prepare any desired sides, such as pasta, red sauceor salad.It’s about as simple as it gets.

The finished result is amazing! These meatballs are:

466,How to Make Cauliflower Rice | Minimalist Baker,"How to Make Cauliflower Rice

Cauliflower is such a versatile vegetable andI’ve grown to love experimenting with it. One of my favorite things to do with this cruciferous vegetable is to turn it into “rice.”
Because rice can often leave dishes feeling heavy, it’s nice to substitute a vegetable where a starch would usuallybe. In addition, it’s a great way to squeeze more servings of vegetables into your day.

There are two techniques for making cauliflower rice. You can either use a box grater withthe medium-size holes (pictured below) traditionally used for cheese, or a food processor with the grater blade to blitz it into small pieces. With both techniques you’re aiming for little pieces the size of rice.
One additional step I like is to pressany excess moisture from the rice by transferring the cauliflower rice to a large paper towel or absorbent dish towel and squeeze/press to remove any remaining water. This ensures no excess moisture remains, which can make your dish soggy.


Once you have your cauliflower rice, it’s easy to cook! Simply sautéin a large skillet over medium heatin 1 Tbsp oil. Use a lid to cover so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Cook for a total of 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, then season as desired (such as with soy sauce or salt and pepper).

","Wash and thoroughly dry cauliflower, then remove all greens.If using a box grater, cut the cauliflower into large chunks and use the medium-sized holes (see photo - the side commonly used to grate cheese), to grate into ""rice."" If using a food processor, cut into small pieces and use the grater attachment to grate the cauliflower into ""rice."" Optional: Transfer to a clean towel or paper towel and press to remove any excess moisture, which can make your dish soggy.Once you have your cauliflower rice, it's easy to cook (or enjoy raw)! Simply sauté in a large skillet over medium heat in 1 Tbsp oil. Cover with a lid so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Cook for a total of 5-8 minutes, then season as desired (such as with soy sauce or salt and pepper).Use cauliflower rice in recipes that call for rice, such as stir fries or fried rice!

","In a large mixing bowl, prepare your coconut whipped cream with your chilled coconut cream. Follow these instructions to make a double batch, sweetened to taste (I found 6-8 Tbsp (42-56 g) to be the right amount // amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Transfer whipped cream to a large freezer bag (for piping) and set in the refrigerator to chill completely. Rinse out the mixing bowl to use for the batter.Measure out almond milk in a liquid measuring cup and add apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice) and baking soda and stir. Set aside.In your large mixing bowl, prepare flax eggs by combining water and flaxseed meal. Let rest for 5 minutes while you prepare your other ingredients.Add the oil, coconut sugar, and maple syrup and whisk to combine.Next add applesauce, vanilla, and salt, and whisk to combine. Then add almond milk mixture and whisk again until everything is thoroughly incorporated - about 30 seconds.Lastly, add baking powder, cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour, and gluten-free flour, and whisk to combine, making sure no large clumps remain.Transfer batter to the refrigerator to chill/thicken for 20 minutes, and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Grease two large baking sheets with non-stick spray (if you don’t have two baking sheets, just use one and bake the cakes in 4 batches // use fewer or more baking sheets, as needed, if altering batch size).Once the oven is preheated, scoop out 1 heaping Tbsp amount of batter onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch of room for spreading. Use your tablespoon to slightly spread them into a small disc. One standard baking sheet should fit 12 cakes. Repeat on second baking sheet.Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until the edges appear dry. (I found 12 minutes to be the perfect time.) Remove from oven and let rest on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to cooling racks to cool completely.Repeat this process, baking the mini cakes until all batter is used - you should have about 48 total cakes (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Once the cakes are completely cooled to the touch, clip a small corner of the coconut whipped cream bag off and pipe a generous amount (see photo) of coconut whipped cream onto the under-side of half the cakes (24 as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Carefully top with another cake of similar size and shape and press down slightly.Arrange on large serving plates or a cooled baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. You can enjoy these immediately; however, I found them to hold up better after 1 hour of refrigeration (and even better after 6 hours or overnight).Leftovers will keep covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for 3-4 days."

In fact, one of myfirst dates with John was at a little Mediterranean cafe in Kansas. We ordered shawarma and fed each other bites between adoring glances.
Yes, we were that couple. That was also the dayI discovered John’s preference forsmall bites and my overwhelming preference for big bites. I felt like he was slightingme all night. Don’t worry – lesson learned, therelationship survived.
Take note world (and husband): Give me atwo-biteror things are gonna go down.

Shawarma is essentiallydefined as a roastedmeat sandwich.Therefore, some people might say “chickpea shawarma” can’t even be a real thing.
To such people, I say, “Go away, naysayer. Chickpeas are delicious and satisfying and I can make a shawarma sandwich out of them if I please.” Hmph.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet (or more if making larger batch) with foil or parchment paper.In a small mixing bowl toss rinsed and dried chickpeas with oil and spices and spread on baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes or until slightly crispy and golden brown. Once slightly cooled, sample and adjust seasonings as desired (I added a bit more sea salt, cumin and garlic powder for extra flavor).While the chickpeas are roasting, prepare your sauce by adding hummus, lemon juice, dill and garlic to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add enough water or almond milk to thin so it’s pourable (~2-3 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust amount if altering batch size).Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more garlic for more zing, salt for savoriness, lemon juice for freshness, and dill for a more intense herb flavor. I found mine didn’t need anything else.To serve, warm pitas or flatbread in the microwave for 15 -30 seconds (or the still warm oven for 1 minute) and top with desired amount of chickpeas, sauce, and vegetables of choice.Best when fresh, though leftover chickpeas and sauce will keep well stored separately in the refrigerator for 3-4 days."
469,Magic Shell Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Magic Shell

Magic shell is such a simple, genius concept. It’s essentially chocolate melted with coconut oil and when it’s drizzled over something cold – like ice cream and milkshakes – it firms up into a hard, shell-like consistency – hence the name “magic shell.”
I’ve been using it to top frozen desserts for a while now and wanted to share my favorite technique. Find it below, along with a few ideasfor how to use it!


","Add chopped chocolate and coconut oil to a small mixing bowl and microwave in 30-second increments until fully melted and creamy, stirring occasionally to aid in the melting process. If you don't have or don't use a microwave, melt over a double boiler on the stove top.Now you have magic shell! To use, spoon over cold desserts, such as ice cream, Peanut Butter Chocolate Banana Milkshakes, or frappuccinos!"

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (or lightly grease with non-stick spray).In the meantime wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top (such as a cast iron skillet) to press out the liquid.Once the oven is preheated, dice tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and arrange on baking sheet. Bake for 26-30 minutes. You’re looking for golden brown edges and a texture that’s firm to the touch. The longer it bakes, the firmer and crispier it will become, so if you’re looking for softer tofu remove from the oven around the 26-28 minute mark. I prefer crispy tofu, so I bake mine the full 30 minutes. Set aside.While the tofu bakes prepare your rice by bringing 12 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, add rinsed rice and stir. Boil on high uncovered for 30 minutes, then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot removed from the heat. Cover with a lid and let steam for 10 minutes*.While rice and tofu are cooking, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a medium-size mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tamari or soy for saltiness, peanut butter for creaminess, brown sugar for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce for heat.Once the tofu is done baking, add directly to the sauce and marinate for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, use a slotted spoon to scoop the tofu into the pan leaving most of the sauce behind. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown on all sides (see photo). Lower heat if browning too quickly. Remove from pan and set aside.To the still hot pan add garlic, green onion, peas and carrots. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, and season with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) tamari or soy sauce (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add cooked rice, tofu, and remaining sauce and stir. Cook over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.Serve immediately with extra chili garlic sauce or sriracha for heat (optional). Crushed salted, roasted peanuts or cashews make a lovely additional garnish. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat or in the microwave."

","If using the Spreadable Vegan Mexican Cheese, prepare first. Otherwise, move on to the next step.Lay one tortilla flat and spread with a thin layer of spreadable cheese - about half of the total amount (1/3 cup as original recipe is written // optional, but recommended).Next top with ~1/3 cup refried beans and spread flat. Continue layering with 1/4 avocado, 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup tomato or salsa, and 1/4 cup cilantro. See photo series as a guide.Use your hands to flatten all the ingredients down so it's easier to roll. Then tightly roll from one end to the other and place seam side down on a cutting board. If any ingredients fall out of the tortilla when rolling, it's OK! It's a hefty pinwheel, so just scrape it aside and move along.Starting in the center of the tortilla, use your hands to form and tighten the roll, moving outward toward the edges. This will help the fillings form together and make slicing easier.Use a serrated knife (blunt-edge knives may smash the pinwheel), and slice into 1/2-inch slices - about 8-10.Repeat the process with second tortilla and remaining ingredients. You should have ~20 pinwheels (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2-3 days."
472,Pretzel Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pretzel Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie

A chocolate mousse pie infused withpeanut butter and nestledina salty pretzel crust?
Yes, we’re doing this. Simply because we can.


This piewas originally going to be achocolate caramel tart. But then the universe said no.
AsIdeveloped the recipeit morphed intoa pie rather than a tart, because I realized not everyone has mini tart pans but nearly everyone has a pie pan.
And although date caramel is delicious, I cravedsomething lighter in texture. So I melted coconut milkwith dark chocolate and whipped it into a creamy, fluffy mousse.Throw in some salty peanut butter and what you have is one seriouslyaddictive pie.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and basicmethods.
The only real “work” is letting the filling set before slicing. Oh man is that chilling time sheer torture. You don’t know how many times I ducked into the fridge for asample, but somehow resisted.Patience, my young ones. It’s worth the wait.
What does it taste like? Something like heaven on earth. It’s:
Creamy
Salty
Sweet
Chocolaty
Peanut Buttery
Coated in pretzels
Rich
&amp; Decadent
You get the idea – it’s amazing!
Make this pie for birthdays, parties, and gatheringsthroughout the summer and beyond. It’s relatively heat-free (with the exceptionof the crust), will please a crowd, and travels well. Plus, who doesn’t like pretzels, peanut butter and chocolate?

","Add coconut cream and dark chocolate to mixing bowl and microwave in 30-second increments until melted, stirring occasionally to incorporate. Be careful not to overheat or the chocolate can lose its creamy texture. (Alternatively, melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Then transfer to a mixing bowl.)Use a whisk to gently stir the mixture until it's completely incorporated and smooth (see photo). Set in the refrigerator uncovered to chill for 2-3 hours, or until mostly firm and it holds its shape when tipped sideways.In the meantime, preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C).To a medium mixing bowl, add pretzel meal, sugar, add melted butter. Stir to thoroughly combine - it should be moist and moldable - add more melted butter (1-2 Tbsp // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) if too dry and crumbly.Transfer mixture to a standard 9-inch pie pan (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size) and use hands to form a uniform crust, working it all the way up the edges of the pan.Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until firm to the touch and slightly browned on the edges. Set aside to cool.Once the filling is chilled and mostly hardened (again, it shouldn't run when tipped sideways), use a mixer on high to whip and incorporate air for about 1 minute, scraping down sides as needed.Add peanut butter and mix once more.Sample and add sweetener to taste. If you prefer a more bittersweet chocolate pie, you may not need any. I added 2-3 Tbsp maple syrup and 3-5 Tbsp organic powdered sugar (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Mix until well incorporated, then transfer to the cooled pretzel crust and smooth the top with a spoon.Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let chill for another 2-3 hours, or overnight. The longer it chills, the firmer the mousse filling becomes.To serve, top with coconut whipped cream, peanut butter, crushed peanuts, and/or crushed pretzels (optional). Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best within the first 1-2 days."
473,Sweet Potato Chickpea Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Sweet Potato &amp; Chickpea Salad

Sometimes I start making a meal on a weekly basis, tweaking and perfecting it as I go. And before I realize it, it’s become a staple in my diet.
Such was the case with this salad.

It starts with masala-spiced chickpeas baked to crispy perfection, and tender, roasted sweet potatoes – a texture and flavor match made in heaven.
Pair these two witha bed of greens and my favorite 3-ingredient tahini dressing, and what you have is mealtime magic.
Bonus? This whole reciperequires just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice), androughly 40 minutesto prepare.

This concept was inspired by my Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl, which has become a fan favorite on the blog! I must say, you all have very goodtaste.
I morphed the Buddha Bowl into a salad to achievea lighter texture,more greens, and maintain thatsame big flavor. It’s become my new go-to dinner.

I think you all are going toLOVE this salad. It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Crispy + tender
Naturally sweet
Subtly spiced
Healthy
Quick
&amp;Satisfying
This would make the perfect plant-based meal for weeknight dinners or for hosting! Divide it intotwo for a hearty entree, or intofour for a hearty side dish alongside meals like Grillable Veggie Burgers, Garlic Mac ‘n’ Cheese, or Easy Vegan Falafel.

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, making sure they're well-salted and thoroughly seasoned. Arrange on half of the prepared baking sheet.Add sweet potato rounds to the other half of the baking and drizzle with remaining oil - toss. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and arrange in a single layer.Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from oven to toss chickpeas and flip sweet potatoes to ensure even cooking. Return to oven and cook for 10-15 minutes more or until sweet potatoes are tender and golden brown, and chickpeas are firm and crispy.In the meantime, add tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup to the mixing bowl you used earlier (for the chickpeas) and whisk to combine. Thin with hot water until pourable. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.Once the potatoes and chickpeas are done roasting, let cool for a few minutes. To serve, divide chard or massaged* kale between serving dishes and top with sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and pumpkin seeds (optional). Serve with dressing on the side.

474,Vegan Thai Iced Tea | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Thai Iced Tea

There are so many delicious things in this world that I wish I could enjoy if it wasn’t for my dairy sensitivity. One of thosethings is Thai Iced Tea.
Say hello to the holy grail of iced teas.

Have you ever triedit? It’s traditionally a vanilla-scented black tea that’s been brewed strong, sweetened with sugar, and topped with condensed milk. Holy yum.
Want to know a secret? You can make it yourself with basic black tea, keep it naturally sweetened with things like maple syrup or coconut sugar, and get that essential creaminess withlight coconut milk.
OK, now we’re talking.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients (plus water), and is remarkably close to what you’d find in a Thai restaurant.
While you can findauthentic Thai Iced Tea mixes at the store and online, I’ve found they typically contain dyes and I wanted to keep mine natural, simple and accessible to everyone.
All you really need is black tea (loose leaf or bagged), vanilla extract, a natural sweetener of choice (I used a mix of muscovado sugar and maple syrup), and coconut milk!
Can we just talk about the creaminess going on here? I mean, can we talk about it?

This tea is amazing! It’s:
Ice cold
Refreshing
Flavorful
Vanilla-infused
Naturally sweetened
Super creamy
Easy
&amp; Luxurious
Make this drink to go alongside your favorite Thai dishes like Pad Thai Spring Rolls, Healthy Thai Carrot Soup, or this Thai Kale Salad. It’s also delicious on its own! Or (serious hack), add a bit of dark rum and enjoy it as a cocktail. Trust me, you need this drink in your life.

Whisk to thoroughly combine and dissolve sugar crystals, then sample and adjust sweetness as needed. Set in the refrigerator to chill (2-3 hours).Once tea is chilled, prepare serving glasses with generous portions of ice (see photo). Fill with tea until 3/4 full, then top with coconut milk. Stir gently and enjoy.Recipe (as originally written) yields enough for 4 generous servings. Add dark rum to taste to make it a creamy cocktail!"
475,Dark Chocolate Almond Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"DIY Dark Chocolate Almond Bars

I’ve been a chocolate fiend for as long as I can remember. My obsession started with Snickers, then digressed to Caramelos (oy!), made a right turn atpeanut butter cups, and has finallyarrived at the basics – good old dark chocolate.
I enjoy dark chocolate most evenings and love trying new vegan brands. But I’d been wanting to makemy own for a while now, especially since procuring cocoa butter for these glorious cheesecakes.
Plus,I knew I could make it refined-sugar free and load itup with my favorite toppings.
Verdict: So good. So easy. At this point I’m basicallyoperating a chocolate factory out ofmy apartment.
Making chocolate at home startswith just 3 ingredients:
Cocoa butter
Cacao or cocoa powder
Maple syrup
That’s really all you need for a good base, at which point you can add vanilla extract to enhance the flavor, sea salt bring out the sweetness, and roasted almonds (or other toppings) for extra crunch.

I have no idea why I waited so long to make chocolate at home. It’s:
Decadent
Perfectlysweet
Melt-in-your-mouthcreamy
Quick + easy
&amp; Supersatisfying
The threshold to make chocolate at home is super low as well! You don’t need fancy molds, thermometers, or equipment; just a whisk, a bowl, and abaking sheet.

Whisk to thoroughly combine.Taste and adjust sweetness if needed - I found 1/3 cup to be perfect (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Pour the chocolate into candy molds (if you have them), mini paper cupcake liners, or simply line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pour the chocolate on top. Top with roasted almonds and sprinkle of salt.Set in the refrigerator or freezer to harden for 30 minutes to 1 hour.Once completely solid, break or cut into pieces/bars.

","Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size), or line with parchment paper. Alternatively, line with foil, but still add a bit of non-stick spray or vegan butter to ease serving.For the crust, add softened butter and sugar to a mixing bowl and beat until light and fluffy in texture - 1 minute.Add flour and salt with mixer on low and mix until combined - it should be crumbly.Add almond milk and mix once more - it should form a cohesive dough. If not, add a bit (1-2 tsp) more almond milk.Transfer dough to prepared 8x8-inch baking dish and dust the surface with flour. Use your hands to press the dough into the dish until flat and uniform.Chill in the freezer for 15 minutes, then preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Bake crust for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown on edges and light golden brown in the center - you want it fairly well done. Let cool, but leave the oven on.In the meantime, prepare filling. Add all filling ingredients except almonds to a small saucepan over medium heat. Vegan butter and chia seeds are optional (to add flavor, richness, and thickness). Cook, stirring/mashing the berries, for about 6-8 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and resembles pourable blueberry jam.Remove from heat and pour over the baked crust. Top with slivered almonds and bake for another 24-28 minutes, or until filling is bubbly along the edges and almonds are slightly golden brown.Let cool completely - about 2-3 hours (or overnight) before serving.Before serving, prepare glaze by adding organic icing sugar to a mixing bowl.

477,Peanut Butter Overnight Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Overnight Oats

Do you have any siblings?
I have one. Her name’s Andrea and she’s my bigsister.
She’s a mom of two, a Scandinavian-looking beauty (think bright blonde hair, bigblue eyes), and a seriously funny human being. I think I’ve stolen all my best jokes from her (sshhhh, don’t tell).
I may have only one sibling, but she’s my favorite.

When your busy, seriouslyamazing sister who’s chasing around two beautiful kids (4 and 2 years old) all day asks if you could make her an overnight oats recipe to make morning mealtime easier, for goodness sake, you make the woman some overnight oats.
If I think waking up at 7am is a travesty, I can onlyimagine how much work it is to raisetwo human beings! A simple breakfast of overnight oats to the rescue.

I tried overnight oats many years ago when they first became a “thing” in the blogosphere. Admittedly though, I haven’t tried them since. I think it’s because if given the choice, I do prefer steel-cut oats.
But with this summer heat wave we’re experiencing, I couldn’t think of abetter time to give this heat-free version another go. Spoiler alert: I’m so glad I did.

This version is as simple as it gets:5 ingredients,5 minutes prep time, no fancy methods, and simple ingredients.
Almond milk, maple syrup and salted peanut butter make a creamy,flavorful base to soak the oats. Chia seeds add nutrition, a little crunch, and help them thicken.
The results areamazing!These oats are:
Creamy
Hearty
Healthy
Perfectly (and naturally) sweet
Peanut buttery
Satisfying
&amp; Absolutelydelicious

I lovehow overnightoats seem to keep the integrity of the oat intact, helping to avoidthat gummy texture that cooked versions sometimes take on. And after a little testing, I’m happy to report that this simple, straight-forward version truly yields the best results! I even tried partially cooking the oats with warm almond milk before refrigerating, but much preferred this completely raw version.
These oats wouldmake the perfect make-ahead breakfast or snack, especially for those of you with hecticmornings. I also think it would make the perfect meal to enjoy after an intense workout – hello 15 grams of protein!

Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.Cover securely with a lid or plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours).The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above).Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours."

I’m a sucker for anything cornbread and blackberry, so recreating these at home was a no-brainer.

While Bijou’s version was only slightly infused withcornmeal, I desired a heartier texture.

Put some chili powder on it and experience a serious flavor bomb.
Trust me, it’s science.

This fruit salad is inspired by three things:

This salad is simple, requiring less than 10 ingredients and just 15 minutes to prepare.
It’s also delicious. Ripe summer fruit is dressed witha simple mixture of lime juice and maple syrup, then tossed with a pinch of sea salt and chili powder.

","Add all fruit to a large mixing/serving bowl.Add lime juice and maple syrup (optional depending on ripeness of fruit) to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then pour over fruit and gently toss to coat.Add sea salt. Then sprinkle on chili powder a little at a time, gently folding/stirring the salad as you go. I found 1/4 tsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to be the perfect amount, but add more or less depending on preference.Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more chili powder, maple syrup, or lime juice as needed. Add tequila or white rum for a boozy kick (optional).Serve immediately, or cover and chill for 2-3 days (sometimes longer depending on freshness of fruit). See notes for freezing tip."
480,30-Minute Cheesy Kale Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Cheesy Kale Chips

When I first realized kale could be made into chips, I went a little overboard.
Kale chip nachos.
Kale chip sprinkles.
Kale chip salad.
Kale chips on everything.
But a cheesy version? That was a newchallenge.

This recipe was inspired by a recent trip to Trader Joe’s, when Idiscovered yet anotheramazing food item I’d never seen before: Cheesy kale chips!
One bite in =mind blown. I was immediately determinedto make them at home. Spoiler alert: It’s SO easy!

These chips are simple, requiring less than 30 minutes and just 8 ingredients to prepare! Plus, they’re loaded with healthyingredients:
Kale// Rich in flavonoids; lowers cholesterol; Vitamins K, A and C; anti-inflammatory.
Nutritional Yeast // Thiamine, folate, vitamins B-6 and B-12, and contains all 18 essential amino acids making it a complete protein.
Cashews // Heart-protecting unsaturated fats, protein, copper, and magnesium.
Sunflower Seeds // Vitamin E and B, copper, selenium, magnesium, protein, and healthy fats.

Did I mention they taste like cheesy, garlicky kale doritos? Because they totally do. They’re:
Cheesy
Savory
Crispy
Satisfying
Quick
Healthy
Easy
&amp; Delicious
Make these chips for movie night, game night, when you’re hosting friends, or just need a snack. These would also makea great topping fordishes like avocado boatsand spicy plantain black bean tacosor a great base formy easy vegan falafel (topped with this tahini dressing)!

","Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (148 C).Add kale to a large mixing bowl and drizzle with oil. Use hands to massage the kale to soften its texture and disperse the oil. Set aside.Add cashews, sunflower seeds, 4 Tbsp nutritional yeast (12 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), salt, pepper, garlic pepper, and cayenne pepper (optional) to a food processor or blender and blend/pulse into a fine meal, scraping down sides as needed.Add spice mixture to the kale and toss with hands to distribute, working it into the grooves so it's thoroughly coated.Divide kale between 2 large baking sheets (or more if increasing batch size) and spread into an even layer, making sure the pieces aren't overlapping to ensure crispiness. You may need to bake them in two batches depending on size of baking sheets.Sprinkle the kale with remaining 1-2 Tbsp (3-6 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) nutritional yeast for extra flavor and bake for 15 minutes. Then remove from oven and toss/flip kale to ensure even baking.Bake for 5-10 minutes more, or until chips are crispy and golden brown. Watch carefully to ensure they don't burn. Let cool slightly before enjoying.Once completely cooled, store leftovers in a large plastic bag or container for 2-3 days. The crispy texture begins fading past 24 hours, so enjoy as close to baking as possible!"
481,Grillable Veggie Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Grillable Veggie Burgers
You guys, I don’t even know where to start, other than, I MADE A VEGGIE BURGER THAT’S GRILLABLE.
All hail theveggie burger!

If you’ve followed Minimalist Baker for a while, you know I’ve made many veggie burgers in the past – exhibit A, B, C, D, andE. Yes, it’s an obsession – I know.
But none of these burgers have been truly“grillable” due to their fragile texture. And because we aren’t currently grill owners, I usually opt for baking or sautéing anyway.
Recently, however we’ve been attendingmore summer BBQs and I’ve been receiving emails from people asking for a burger that will hold up on the grill.
Friends, I’ve found the solution. Bonus? It’s so easy.

This burger requires just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and comes together in 30 minutes (once yourbrown rice is cooked).
Plus, the method is sosimple:
Blend toasted walnuts with spices
Sauté onion
Mash black beans
Add remaining ingredients
Stir/mash like a madwoman/madman.
All that’s left to do is form them into patties and fire up the grill (or skillet).

I tested these burgers on both the grill and skillet andam happy to reportthey’re fabulous either way.
You do get a bit more “char” and blackening onthe grill, whereaswith sautéing you get a more evenly browned surface. So pick and choose by whichtexture you prefer.

You guys are going to LOVE these burgers! They’re:
Hearty
Simple
Super flavorful
Satisfying
Loaded with healthy ingredients
Crowd-pleasing
&amp; Seriously tasty
Oh, and did I mention each burger (one of five) has nearly 14 grams of protein?! Trust me, you’re going to go home satisfied after eatingone of these (especially when paired with a hearty salad,sweet potato wedges, or crispy baked matchstickfries).

","If your brown rice isn’t cooked yet, start there by following this method for the best results. Otherwise, move onto the next step.Heat skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add raw walnuts and toast for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and golden brown. Let cool and move onto the next step.In the meantime, heat the same skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and onion. Season with a bit of salt and pepper and sauté for 3-4 minutes, or until onion is fragrant, soft, and translucent. Remove from heat and set aside.Once walnuts are cooled, add to blender or food processor with chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, pepper and coconut sugar and blend until a fine meal (see photo) is achieved. Set aside.To a large mixing bowl, add drained, dried black beans and mash well with a fork, leaving only a few whole beans (see photo).Next add cooked rice, spice-walnut mixture, sautéed onion, panko bread crumbs, BBQ sauce, and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon for 1-2 minutes, or until a moldable dough forms. If dry, add extra 1-2 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) BBQ sauce. If too wet, add more panko bread crumbs. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.For larger burgers, divide into 5 patties (1/2 cup in size // amount as original recipe is written), or form 10 smaller burgers (1/4 cup in size // amount as original recipe is written). To help form the patties, line your 1/2 or 1/4 measuring cup with plastic wrap and pack with burger mixture. Press down to pack firmly, then lift out by the plastic wrap’s edge, and slightly flatten with hands to form a 3/4-inch thick patty. Set on a baking sheet or plate for grilling.If grilling, heat the grill at this time and brush the grill surface with oil to ease cooking. Otherwise, heat the same skillet you used earlier to medium heat.Once skillet is hot, add just enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of your skillet, then add your burgers - only as many as will comfortably fit in the pan. Otherwise, add burgers to the grill and close lid.Cook for 3-4 minutes or until well browned on the underside, then flip gently. They aren't as firm as meat burgers, but will definitely hold their shape. Reduce heat if cooking/browning too quickly. Cook for 3-4 minutes on other side.Remove burgers from heat to let cool slightly, and prepare any other toppings/sides at this time (such as grilling/toasting your buns).Serve burgers as is, or on toasted buns with desired toppings. Leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. See notes for freezing/reheating instructions."

It’s science.

After making these gorgeous papaya boats, I couldn’t let the fun stop there.
I’ve been an avocado fiend lately – as in I eat half of one almost every day! So I couldn’t resist the urge to turn theminto a complete meal.I’m absolutely smitten with this buttery green fruit (yes fruit!). Avocados arebeautiful, nutrient-rich, loaded with healthy fats, andwonderfullyversatile.
Let’s not only make them into guacamole or smash them on toast, friends! Let’s dream bigger.

This recipe has two options! The first is inspired by both Indian and Mediterranean cuisines with crispy, masala-spiced chickpeas and a maple-lemon tahini sauce.
The second is influencedby Mexican cuisine with spicy black beans, taco-inspired toppings, and salsa or hot sauce. Serve this version with tortilla chipsfor a hearty meal or side dish.

I think you guys are going to LOVE these boats, no matter which style you choose. They’re:

","FOR CHICKPEAS: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. While it heats, add drained/dried chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with sea salt and masala spice blend.Once skillet is hot, add oil and chickpeas to pan and sauté, stirring frequently, until slightly crispy and browned - about 8-10 minutes. If browning too quickly, turn down heat.Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set aside to cool. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt or masala spice as desired.Prepare desired sauce at this time (see recipes / instructions by following the links above).To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lemon juice, chickpeas, parsley, tomatoes, onion and desired sauce. Serve immediately - best when fresh.FOR BLACK BEANS: Add slightly drained black beans to a small saucepan and season with cumin, garlic powder and chili powder. If unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt (amount as original recipe is written // if altering batch size, use 1/4 tsp per can of beans). Stir to combine.Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, or until bubbly and warm.While beans are cooking, prepare any desired toppings.To serve, halve avocados and remove pits. You can either scoop out the avocado or leave it in the skin (removing it from the skin is a little more messy, but it does make it easier to eat).Top avocados with a generous squeeze of lime juice, black beans, cilantro, onion, and desired sauce (I went with salsa and hot sauce). Serve immediately as is or with tortilla chips - best when fresh.NOTE: Both styles of avocado boats are delicious on their own, but they would also go well atop a green salad."
483,Easy Traditional Red Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Traditional Red Sangria

I had the best sangria(and patatas bravas) of my life when we went to Spain in 2013.
Perhaps my recollection of thatfirst drink is slightly biased. We’d just arrived to Barcelona from a long, tiring train ride, and then walkedwhat seemed like miles carrying 40-pound backpacks into the city to reach our AirBnB. We were tired and hangry, to say the least.
Our first thought upon dropping our bags was “tapas and sangria.”So off we went in search of sustenance, and what we found was glorious.

Can we all just agree the Spanish do it well, “it” being everything?
Traditionally the Spanishenjoycoffee in the morning, work a little, take an afternoonrest (or siesta), work a little more, then retire in the evening byeating tapas and drinkinggoodwine with the people they love. Eventually, they slumber only to do it all over again the next day. If that doesn’t sound like a slice of heaven, I don’t know what does.
Oh, and did I mention they gifted the world with sangria? Does it get any better than this lush, fruity beverage? I think not.

This recipe is my humble offering to a sangria-lovingworld.
I’ve tasted,tested, researched, retested, and what I’ve come upwith is this easy, 6-ingredient, traditional red sangria that’s got everything I’m looking for:
Fruit
Sweet
Dry
Lush
Smooth
Refreshing
&amp; Boozy
I think I’m in love.

Though there are many interpretations of what “traditional sangria” is, I’ve found that it typically requiresthese main components:
Fruit (like apples and oranges)
Orange juice
A sweetener (like brown sugar or cane sugar)
A liquor (like brandy or rum)
Bold, fruity, dry Spanish red wine (like Tempranillo, Garnacha, or other Rioja wine)
&amp; Ice (for chilling)
For this version, I went with brandy because as soon as I smelled it,I immediately thought, “this smells like sangria!” But of course, if you’d rather use rum, be my guest.

This sangria is my new go-to summer drink. It’s:
Simple
Sweet
Slightly dry
Fruity
Boozy
Summery
Refreshing

484,Raspberry Mango Sorbet | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raspberry Coconut Mango Sorbet

When I was a kid, I was a sucker for a good orange sherbet. In fact, orange push-up pops (anyone remember those?!) were one of my favorite summertime treats.
When given the option, I’ll almost always choose ice cream over sherbet and sorbet because I much prefer richer, more indulgent flavors (like Sea Salt Caramel). But mydairy intolerance has pushed me todevelopmore of a palette for fruity flavors, which often come in the form of sorbet. I’m slowly but surely getting on board.
This recipe was my first attempt at homemade sorbet and I’m floored with the results. If you make one dessert from ourblog this summer, make it this one!

Mango is sonaturally sweet and creamy I suspected it would lenditself perfectly to sorbet. Thankfully, that’s exactly what happened.
This recipe is a sorbet-sherbet hybrid, with the addition of coconut milk for an extra-creamy touch.
And the flavor? So tropical and perfect I could hardly stand it. I found that the combination of mango + raspberry + coconut somehow = GUAVA, so much so that I almost called it guava sorbet! But, that would be misleading, I suppose, since there’s no actual guava in the mix. So, Raspberry Coconut Mango Sorbet it is.

This recipe is simple, requiring simple methods and just 6 ingredients. It does require an ice cream churner, but the base is so thick and creamy that I think you could get away with just freezing the base and stirring/whisking every hour to achieve a light texture.
Not everyone will be on board with using straight up cane sugar (I was hesitant myself) as this recipe requires, but that’s kind of the science of sorbet. You need it to create the right texture and sweetness without introducing unwantedflavors (like maple syrup would).
I did a lot of researchon the sorbet(primarily over at Serious Eats – a fantastic site for new and curious cooks) prior to this recipe. And as far as I understand it, the twobest sweeteners for sorbet (and sherbet) are:1. Corn Syrup (not high fructose), and2. Sugar (granulated or cane).
I was a little weary to try corn syrup since it’s not a common ingredient, nor does it have the best reputation. (Try asking a Whole Foods employee if they have corn syrup and see how many appalledlooks you get.) So I went with cane sugar and must say the results were phenomenal.
Obviously, cane sugar is more “processed” that maple syrup or coconut sugar, but I would highly recommend sticking to the recipe as written. The only alternative sweetener Iwould suggest would be substitutinghoney for up to half of the sugar, since it’s minimally processed, floral,and has a natural thick/creamy texture. However, that would make this recipe not vegan-friendly, so test and substitute as your dietary needs and preferences allow.

Once scoop in and I knew this sorbetwas perfection. It’s:
Ultracreamy
Perfectly sweet
Fruity
Refreshing
Summery
Tropical
&amp; Fun + easy to make

Also add all ingredients to a blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth - 2-3 minutes.Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed, then transfer to a mixing bowl and cover. Set in refrigerator to chill overnight (or for a minimum of 3-4 hours).The following day, add your chilled base to the prepared ice cream churning bowl and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions for 30-40 minutes, or until it looks like soft serve.Transfer to a freezer-safe container and smooth top with a spoon. Cover securely and freeze for 4-6 hours, or until firm.Let thaw at room temperature for 10-15 minutes before serving to soften. Use a hot scoop to ease serving.

A birthday cake? Yes, a birthday cake!
Why, you ask? Because it’s the eve of my 29th birthday and I’m feeling a little sappy(and vain).
Like whoa, 29 is almosttouching 30. Look out world.

First, let’s talk about the cake:
1 Bowl
Simple methods
Super chocolatey
Mega moist
Not too sweet
Adapted from this bad-boy
Summery
Brimmingwith coconut whipped cream
Loaded with berries
Who’s ready to party?

Second,in celebration of my birthday, I give you 29 things I’ve learned thus far in life:

Sometimes, following your passion actually works. An obsession withfood led me to create this blog (and it’s the best job ever).
Orderinga double scoop ice cream sundaepast high school is not sustainable.
Life is about so much more than the way you look.
Marrying your best friend is the best idea, ever.
When in doubt, Indian takeout.
(Cliche as it may be) dance whenever the mood strikes.
Good friends make all the difference.
Listen to your body and be your own health advocate – no one else will do it for you.
Stop telling people what to do. It never works anyway.
Always play with puppies. Especially the super tiny cuddly ones.
Rainy days are underrated.
Do the things that make you happy, even when you feel silly.
Use your lady balls whenever necessary. You know what I mean, ladies.
Travel often – it’s not good to live in a bubble. Besides, the world is pretty damn beautiful.
Stand up for yourself even ifit’s uncomfortable.
Never go camping. Like, ever. (But dos’mores often.)
Getting up early isoverrated.
Planning ahead really does help your workflow and sanity. (See my Editorial Calendar here.)
Meeting internet friends in real life almost always works out.
Writinga print cookbook will be one of the hardest (and most fulfilling) things I’ll ever do.
Every summer, get in the water (at least once).
When in doubt, go to the ocean (and order pizza).
It’s OK to creep out on You Tubers (i.e. Vivianna and ImJenn). It’smynewest form of therapy.
Dark chocolate &gt; candy.
Live where you love (e.g. Portland, Oregon)
Life is too short to work at a job you hate.
Brunch is always the answer.
But first, coffee (so true).
When it’s your birthday, always eat cake (it’s your one legit excuse per year – get on board).


I went with coconut whip“frosting”for summery vibes, but you couldtotally opt for a traditional frosting if you prefer. A few options include my Vegan Chocolate Ganache, Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting, and Vegan Buttercream. Or, keep it simple witha dustingof organic powdered sugar or cocoa powder.
The berries kind of make it, especially in summer! So whichever frosting route you decide to go, definitely consider these as a finishing touch.

Make this cake for your own birthday (like I did), or for family and friends. It’s the perfect treat everyone will be able to partake in and fully enjoy.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and butter three 8"" round cake pans (or line 24 muffin tins with paper liners // adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Dust pans with gluten free flour and shake out excess.Measure out almond milk in a liquid measuring cup and add vinegar. Stir and let curdle while moving onto the next step.Prepare flax eggs by mixing water with flaxseed meal in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Next, add baking soda to the almond milk vinegar mixture and stir. Set aside.Add the oil, cane sugar, and maple syrup to the flax egg and beat/whisk to combine.Next, add applesauce, vanilla, and salt and beat/whisk to combine. Then add almond milk mixture and whisk again.Lastly, add baking powder, cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour, and gluten-free flour and beat/whisk to combine, making sure no large clumps remain.If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk, but it should be perfect. It should resemble a semi-thick batter that’s pourable.Divide batter evenly between the three prepared cake pans (or muffin tins). Bake cakes for 30-40 minutes (cupcakes for about 28-35 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean and the edges appears dry. (Time will vary if you subbed ingredients, as well as depending on the size of your pans.)Let cake rest in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully run a butter knife along the edges and invert onto cooling racks. Let cool completely.In the meantime, prepare your coconut whipped cream. Follow these instructions to make a double batch, sweetened to taste (I found 6-8 Tbsp | 42-56 g to be the right amount // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Set in the refrigerator to chill/firm up while cake cools completely.NOTE: Assemble just before serving so the whipped cream doesn’t over-moisten the cake.To assemble, lay down one cake bottom side up on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread on a semi-thick layer of coconut whipped cream and top with second cake, also bottom side up. Frost with another layer of coconut whipped cream.Carefully top with remaining cake (also bottom side up) and frost the top generously with remaining coconut whipped cream. (You may not use it all, which you can reserve for serving). Top with berries and serve immediately (or cover and chill in the refrigerator until serving).Leftovers will keep covered with a cake stand or plastic wrap in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best when fresh. (The unfrosted cake will keep covered at room temperature for several days.)"

So simple, heat-free summer appetizers it is!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 8 ingredients and 15 minutes to prepare! Just stir filling ingredients, spread into a tortilla, roll and slice!
And the flavors? Oh, they’re meant for each other.
Sun-dried tomatoes pair with fresh basil, while fresh garlic and vegan parmesan cheesepack a serious punch to the vegan cream cheese base. A little spinach intensifies the green hue whileboosting the nutritional content. Ooh, dreamy.


So what do they taste like? FLAVOR BOMBS. They’re:

Savory
Fresh
Basil-infused
Rich in sun-dried-tomato goodness
&amp; Seriously satisfying
Plus, that color? How can you go wrong?

487,Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino

I still remember the first time I walked into a coffee shop as a complete newbie and feeling totally dumbfounded as to what to order.
My choice in the colder months was hot chocolate – obviously. But once summer hit, I ventured into blended frozen drink territory.
Enter: my love for the frappuccino.

I don’t order frappuccinos anymore at coffee shops. As I’ve said before, they have enough calories and sugar to sink a boatand I’m honestly more into almond milk lattes and straight up drip coffee these days. But every once in a while, when a craving for something cold and indulgent strikes, this is the first thing I reach for. And I can make it way more healthy (and dairy free) at home.
This Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino is adapted from one of the very first recipes on the blog – my Cold Brew Mocha Frappe. Almond milk ice cubes create a creamy base, cold brew coffee injects a jet-fuel surge of caffeine and bold coffee flavor, and dates puréed into caramel add a sweet caramel finish.
That’s right. Just 3 ingredients, 1 blender,and 5 minutes (minus prep for ice cubes and coffee) to make this dreamy, creamy homemade frappuccino.

While your cold brew coffee is doing its thing, make your date caramel. See my in-depth tutorial herethat also includes1,000,000 ideasfor how to use it.
In short, make it, love it, always have it on hand. End of story.

When your almond milk ice cubes are completely frozen, add them to a blender with your cold brew coffee and blend into creamy, dreamy bliss.
Then add as much date caramel as you’d liketo sweeten things up and infuse caramel flavor into the mix. Mmm, I’ll take three, please.

You guys are going to LOVE this drink! It’s:
Creamy
Chilled
Perfectly Sweet
Caramel-infused
Bold in coffee flavor

","The night before, pour almond milk into a standard ice cube tray and freeze. You should have about 16 ice cubes (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).The night before also make your cold brew coffee by coarsely grinding dark roast coffee beans. Add to a mixing bowl and cover with filtered water, then cover with plastic wrap and set in the refrigerator to brew.The next day, strain cold brew through a coffee filter - I used our Chemex with these filters.While your coffee is straining, make date caramel by adding 15-20 pitted dates (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a food processor or blender (in my experience, a food processor works best to get a creamy texture without much water).Pulse/mix on low until small bits remain, then stream in hot water while the blender is on until a paste is made. You will need to scrape down the sides and encourage it along periodically. Only add enough water to form a paste - too much and it will be too liquidy. Set aside.To make 2 frappuccinos, (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) add all 16 ice cubes and 2 cups (480 ml) cold brew coffee to a blender and blend on high until puréed and smooth (see photo).Add date caramel 1 Tbsp at a time and blend. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more date caramel to sweeten. I found 3 or 4 Tbsp to be the perfect amount (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). NOTE: you will have leftover date caramel, which can be stored covered in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks.Divide between tall serving glasses and top with coconut whipped cream (optional). Best when fresh, though leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for a few hours, or in the freezer for a few days."

It’s just too darn hot to eat anything but salads and spring rolls these days.
Portland is experiencing a serious heat wave that’s only been intensified byour lack of air conditioning.
I’m trying to keep my oven off as much as possible, but my one exception is these brown sugar roasted pecans. They’re crispy, salty-sweet, and toast up beautifully while you prepare the rest of your salad. And trust me, you’re gonna want this salad.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and right around 10 ingredients (give or take a hemp seed).

489,Easy Vegan Falafel | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Falafel

World, meet falafel. Falafel, meetyour eaters.

This recipe really threw me for a loop! But aftermultiple rounds of testing, I believe it’s perfected and ready to be enjoyed by all of you.
I’ve made two other falafel recipes forthe blog. First were my Better Than Restaurant Falafel, which still rank up there as one of my all-time favorite plant-based recipes! And last year I made these Baked Falafel Burgers, which are all kinds of hearty and delicious.
But I was still craving something a bit more traditional. And since I eat falafel so often at restaurants, I wanted a recipe I could make at home and really enjoy. I believe I’ve gotten as close as humanly possible without busting out the fryer – a feat I have yet to attempt.

These falafel are simple, requiring just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice), and cometogether in a blender or food processor.
They also sauté up beautifully in just 5 minutes! The only waiting period is 1-2 hours for chilling the dough (which is optional but recommended). Otherwise, these little gems come together with minimal effort and time.
What is a falafel without a good sauce? My 4-ingredient garlic-dill sauce is not to be missed. While your falafels are cooking, whip this up in just 5 minutes to elevate this dishto the next level of awesome. Trust me on this one – you’re gonna want that sauce.

I hope you all love this recipe! It’s:
Simple
Flavorful
Crispy on the outside
Tender on the inside
Garlicky
&amp; Super satisfying
Who needs take-out when you can make perfectly delicious falafel at home? Serve these in a pita with tomato, onion, lettuce and mygarlic-dill sauce andyou’re seriously good to go. Hummus and vegetables make an excellent side dish. Otherwise, serve these atop a bed of greens for a lighter option.

","Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin, salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a crumbly dough, not a paste (see photo).Add flour 1 Tbsp at a time and pulse/mix to combine until no longer wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to your hands - I used 4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt, pepper, and a dash of cardamom and coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty bold, so don’t be shy.Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to firm up. If you’re in a hurry you can skip this step but they will be a little more fragile when cooking.Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in weight // I used this scoop) and gently form into 11-12 small discs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Optional: Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to adhere - flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier crust but is optional.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to generously coat the pan - about 2 Tbsp. Swirl to coat.Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very comfortably in the pan at a time - about 5.Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned - the deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they'll be. They will also firm up more once slightly cooled.Serve warm with garlic-dill sauce or hummus, inside a pita with desired toppings or atop a bed of greens.Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator covered for several days. Freeze after that to keep fresh for up to 1 month."

491,Date Caramel Recipe | Minimalist Baker,"
If you’ve ever wonderedhow to make date caramel, this is the tutorial for you! Date caramel is so easy to make and extremely delicious, but there are a couple of important tricks to know before you dive in.
1) It’s all about having good, moist, fresh dates. If your dates aredry and hard, they won’t blendas well and will require soaking in warm water first in order to soften them. Otherwise, you won’t achieve that creamy, caramel-like consistency. So, whenever possible, look for the freshest, most sticky dates you can find.
2) It’s all about the equipment. In my experience, a food processor works best to get that ultra creamy, smooth texture. But now that I’ve simplified and only have a Vitamix, I’ve found it’s not quite as easy with a blender. While theyget the job done, blenders just require a little more time, effort and a bit more water to get things going.
Now that you have the basics down, let’s make caramel!


","Add pitted dates to a food processor or high-speed blender (in my experience, a food processor works best to get a creamy texture without having to add much water).Pulse/mix on low until small bits remain. Then stream in hot water while the blender is on until a paste is made. You will need to scrape the down sides and encourage it along periodically.Be sure to only add enough water to form a paste - too much and it will be too liquidy. Amount will depend on your machine and size/moistness of dates.Leave as is, or add a pinch of salt to enhance flavor (optional). Will keep covered in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks, and often more.Date caramel is perfect for adding to things like 5-Ingredient Peanut Butter Caramel Truffles, Peanut Butter and Jelly Pie, No Churn Ice Cream, Vegan Pumpkin Caramels, Dulce De Leche Pops, Ice Cream Snickers Bars, Sea Salt Caramel Coconut Ice Cream, Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Pie and more.It also makes a wonderful natural sweetener in dishes like oatmeal and milkshakes."

","Halve a ripe seedless watermelon and scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (or cube with a knife). Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze until firm - about 3-4 hours.In the meantime, halve another small seedless watermelon and add the fruit (leaving the rind behind) to a blender. Blend on high, adding a touch of water if needed (I didn't), until completely smooth and pureed.OPTIONAL: Drape a large, thin dish towel over a mixing bowl and pour over juice. Then gather corners, lift up and squeeze the juice out leaving the pulp behind - there shouldn't be much, but this makes the juice extra smooth. Transfer to a mason jar, cover, and refrigerate - should keep for 3-4 days, or more.Once watermelon is frozen, add ~ 4 cups (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) frozen watermelon (I found 4 cups was about three-quarters of one small watermelon), coconut milk, lime juice, and watermelon juice to a blender and blend on low until creamy and smooth. You will need to scrape down the sides and blend on low to encourage it along. If it has trouble blending, add a bit more watermelon juice, but not too much or it will become too thin.Once the slushie is blended and smooth, taste and adjust flavor as needed. Add more coconut milk for creaminess, lime for brightness, a pinch of salt to enhance sweetness, or sweetener of choice to sweeten. Blend and sample again - repeat as needed.Serve in empty watermelon rinds or chilled serving glasses and garnish with a lime wedge.This recipe serves 2 generously. Best when fresh!

It’s summerrrrrtimmeeee. Let’s celebrate with all the fruit crisp, shall we?

Lately my Saturdayshave consisted of a trip the farmers market wherein I grab all of the leafy greens,seedy bread and fruit I can find. Then, I stumble home and tryto think of ways to consume all of said food. This crisp is one of those ways.
This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and is inspired by my new-found love for peaches. I used myNectarine Strawberry Crispas inspiration, but this versionis butter-free and hasvery little added sugar. It also includes some gluten-free flour to give the topping extratexture.I love how the fruit gets all caramelized and bubbly while the topping turnscrisp and deep golden brown while baking.

497,Easy Vegan Alfredo (GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Vegan Alfredo (GF)

I don’t think I’ve ever met aperson who didn’t like alfredo pasta.
It’s so rich, creamy, and classically Italian. Plus, it’s loaded with so much parmesan cheeseit’s practically irresistible.
So what’s a dairy-free girl to do? Improvise.

This isn’t my first time sharing an alfredo recipe. Before cutting out dairy I made this simple version with garlic ciabatta bread. Then, I revisited therecipe after learning olive oil made a delicious butter-free alfredo sauce.
However, both of those versions still containmilk and cheese, and I’ve since created a version that’s completely dairy- and gluten free that’s seriously close to the real thing. Bonus? It only requires 30 minutes and 9ingredients.

The basedis createdwith a roux, which isachieved with olive oil, garlic, and either arrowroot powder or all-purpose flour. After some testing, I’ve found all purpose flour yields a creamier sauce, but the gluten free version isn’t far behind.
Plain almond milk addscreamy texture; vegan parmesan cheese and nutrition yeast pack in tons of cheesy flavor; and garlic powder, salt and pepper add depth and savoriness.
To keep this recipe gluten-free as written, use your favorite gluten-free pasta. I love Trader Joe’s gluten-free fusilli and spaghetti. But a more traditional noodle to serve would be linguini, which just happens to be my all-time favorite pastashape.

Yes, this is real life. Cherry pie, in ice cream, 100% vegan.
Who’s with me?!

I was inspired to create this recipe after making a cherryice cream for the cookbook (yay!) and the results were fabulous.
The pie concept came in because, America. Plus, the 4th of July is right around the corner and everyone needs a vegan dessert to bring to their cookouts to wowall their friends, am I right?

I’m sure you’re wondering, do you actually bake a pie for the filling? Yes!
But it stays within the 10 ingredient limit and takes placewhile the ice cream base is chilling. It’s borderline sorcery, I know. Just trust me on this.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients:
Cherries
Maple Syrup
Cane Sugar
Cashews
Coconut Milk
Coconut Oil
Vanilla
Sea Salt
All-Purpose Flour
Vegan Butter (or more coconut oil)
Bonus? It actually comes together quite quickly (~3 hours total + freezing), thanks to a shortcut I include for chillingthe ice cream base.

So, what does it taste like? Just like the name suggests – cherry pie swirled into rich, vanillaice cream! It’s:
Creamy
Perfectly sweet
Swirledwith cherries
Packed with real pie crust
Decadent
Easy
&amp; Seriously delicious
I think this is the perfect dessert to make this summer when cherries are at their peak flavor and sweetness. Take it along to4th of July celebrations, pool parties, and pretty much all summer gatherings.

","The night before, be sure to soak your cashews and place your ice cream maker bowl in the freezer to chill.To a high speed blender add soaked, drained cashews, coconut milk, oil, maple syrup, cane sugar, vanilla, and sea salt. Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust sweetness as needed, adding more cane sugar or maple syrup if desired - I found 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup + 1 Tbsp cane sugar to be perfect (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Transfer to a mixing bowl and cover. Freeze for 1 1/2 hours to chill.While the base is chilling, prepare cherry compote by adding cherries, water or orange juice, maple syrup or sugar, and flour to a small saucepan and bringing to a simmer over medium heat.Use a wooden spoon to smash cherries and stir to incorporate. You want to break them down quite a bit so the ice cream scoops easier later on. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 3-5 minutes, or until it resembles cherry pie filling. Remove from heat - set aside.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Prepare crust by adding flour and salt to a blender or food processor (or a mixing bowl). Pulse (or whisk) to combine. Then add cold butter or semi-firm coconut oil and pulse (or use a fork/pastry cutter to mix) until it resembles wet sand, scraping down sides as needed.Add cold water 1 Tbsp at a time, intermittently mixing, until a loose dough is formed. Transfer to a floured surface and form into a 1-inch thick disc with your hands, handling as little as possible.Dust the top of the dough and rolling pin and roll into a large, thin circle the shape of your pie pan, adding more flour as needed.Gently roll the dough onto the rolling pin from one end to another and transfer to a pie pan (mine is 9 inches, but any similar size will do).Drape and form into the pan and crimp the edges, not worrying about appearance as it will be crumbled anyway. Add cherry pie filling and bake on the center rack of your 350 degree oven for 44-47 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Set aside to cool.Assemble your chilled ice cream maker and pour in the chilled ice cream batter. Also add the equivalent of 1 slice of pie with crust (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), crumbling a little. Do this at the beginning of churning to impart more flavor into the base. Then churn until creamy and thick and resembles soft serve - about 20 minutes.In the last 30 seconds of churning, add in the desired amount of remaining pie, crumbling as you add it to ease scooping later. (NOTE: Know that the more pie you add, the more difficult it can be to scoop since the texture becomes more chunky. As an option, you could reserve some to serve with the ice cream instead of adding it to the base.)Reserve about 1/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of the crust for serving, if desired. Churn until just incorporated, then turn off machine.Enjoy immediately as soft serve, or transfer ice cream to a freezer-safe container and smooth flat with a spoon.Cover securely and freeze for 4-5 hours or until firm. Before scooping, set out for 20-30 minutes to soften and use a hot scoop to ease the scooping process. I found this ice cream easier to scoop into balls rather than in rows, since the crust and cherries form little chunks in the ice cream. The extra work is worth the effort!Serve with additional pie crust crumbles and a fresh cherry on top (optional) or coconut whipped cream. Keeps in the freezer for up to 1 week, though best within the first few days."

It’s that time again.
Time for anew vegan mac ‘n’ cheese recipe (because, delicious), and anewrecipe VIDEO!
Be stoked.
Having already createdan eggplant– and cashew-based mac ‘n’ cheese recipe, I wanted to do something a bit more traditional usinga flour and (almond) milk roux. Although it doesn’t have as much plant power going on, it is insanely creamyand way faster than my other methods once the garlic is roasted, leaving just a 30-minute prep/cook time.This recipe also only requires 10 ingredients.
To inject extra flavor I infused the sauce with two kinds of garlic: an entire head of roasted garlic and fresh minced garlic. This provides both a spicy, garlic bite, and a sweet, creamy roasted garlic flavor. I’m in love.

","To roast garlic, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cut off the very top of a head of garlic. Drizzle the top with a bit of oil, a sprinkle of salt and loosely wrap in foil.Place directly on oven rack and roast for 45 minutes - 1 hour, depending on size of garlic. You'll know it's done when the garlic is very fragrant and the bulb appears soft and golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool.To prepare pasta, add macaroni to a large pot of boiling, well-salted water. Stir to prevent noodles from sticking, and boil according to package instructions (about 8-10 minutes). Drain and cover with a towel to keep moist - set aside.To prepare sauce, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot add oil and minced garlic. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until light golden brown.Immediately add lesser amount of flour (or use arrowroot powder // 4 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and whisk - cook for 1 minute. (Later on, if the sauce is not thick enough, add an extra 1 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) later on during the blending process. I found 4 Tbsp to be the perfect amount).Add almond milk 1/2 cup at a time, whisking to prevent clumps, until 2 cups have been added (amount as original recipe is written // use lesser end of range if altering batch size). Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. (Add the additional 1/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) almond milk later on if the sauce appears too thick.)Transfer sauce to a blender and add roasted garlic (squeeze from base to push out cloves), salt and pepper, vegan parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, and blend on high until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed - you want it pretty well salted + cheesy, so don't be shy.Return sauce back to skillet and cook over low heat until warmed and slightly thickened - about 2-3 minutes.Add cooked, drained pasta and toss to coat. Then top with 1 more Tbsp nutritional yeast and 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Broil on high on the top rack of your oven for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown (see photo). Watch closely as it can burn quickly.Serve immediately. I love topping mine with an extra pinch of vegan parmesan cheese and a little red pepper flake.Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop - add extra almond milk if it's dry."
500,Aloo Tikki: Potato Cakes with Green Chutney | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Aloo Tikki (Indian Potato Cakes with Green Chutney)

Oh, Indian food. I could write an entire novel chroniclingmy love for this cuisine, but even thatwould fail tofully describe how I feel.
While I don’t cook it that much at home, we tend to get Indian takeout at least once every coupleweeks. Perhaps my favorite dish is the vegetable samosa. Crispy cruststuffedwith tenderpotatoes and peas, perfectly spiced, and begging to be dipped in chutney.
How can you go wrong?

The problem with samosas is two-fold:
1) They’re fried. I’m pretty much terrified of frying anything, so that’s a no-go.
2) They’re quite complicated. It’s nearly impossible to make a samosa recipe that will fall under my simple standards.
So, I decided to get creative and tackle the Indian dish that reminds me most of a samosa: Aloo Tiki.
Here’s the deal. Yes, the crust is delicious. If you want a fried pocket of dough, go to your neighborhood Indian restaurant and order a whole basket. There’s no shame in that. But if you want to make an inspired, simplified version at home, I have just the thing.

I’m convinced my favorite elements ofa samosa are the tender potato-pea filling, the spices, and the chutney sauce for dipping (read, drowning).
I keptthese elements intact while ensuring this recipe was simple, condensingit down to just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice). And to mimic the pastrycrust, I provide anoption of crusting them in panko bread crumbs.
This is entirely optional and can takethem off of the gluten-free spectrum. But I found myself gravitating toward the panko-coated cakes more in the end.

And that chutney. Oh, the chutney. So green. So fresh. So perfect.
I’ve studied up on how to make a sweet, greenchutneyand it’s actually quite simple. The best grinder for the job is a small food processor. The next ideal option is a mortar and pestle. And lastly, if you’re like me, you can use a coffee/spice grinder in a pinch. Fair warning, clean up is a little messy as I don’t think they’re intended for wet herbs, but it gets the job done!
I hope you guys love the aloo tiki! They’re the best way I’ve found to mimic a samosa at home without a million ingredients orbusting out thefrying oil.

","Add potatoes to a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender and slide easily when picked up with a knife. Drain and set aside.While the potatoes cool, prepare chutney. Use a small food processor, mortar and pestle, or a spice grinder* to combine all ingredients until well blended and pureed. (A blender may work, depending on size - the smaller the better).Add only enough water to encourage blending. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more garlic, salt, sweetener, or lime as desired.Add cooled potatoes to a mixing bowl along with vegan butter, salt and spices. Mash to combine, trying not to overmix. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I found the cardamom really helped the curry flavor punch through. Don't be timid with the salt.Add peas and mix once more. Then scoop out about 1/4 cup measurements and form into round discs (should be enough for 8-10 cakes as original recipe is written).Season the tops of the cakes with a pinch more salt, pepper and curry powder. If using panko bread crumbs - I tested with and without and would recommend for a crispier crust - sprinkle on top and gently press to adhere.Heat a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add enough vegan butter or oil to coat and add 3-4 patties spice side down, being careful not to crowd the pan. Sprinkle the tops with salt, pepper, curry powder and panko crumbs. Press gently again to adhere.Brown for 4-5 minutes, turning down heat if they brown too quickly. Gently flip (being careful as they can be fragile), and brown for 4-5 more minutes, or until deep golden brown.Remove from pan and repeat until all patties are cooked, adding more vegan butter or oil as needed.Serve with chutney. These work as finger food but are most ideal when plated and eaten with a fork. Leftovers keep well (separated) covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
501,Tropical Papaya Boats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tropical Papaya Boats

Ah, summertime. The perfect season to forgo bowls and use fruit instead. Let’s do this!

Have you ever tried a papaya?
My first time was when wevacationed inBali and it seemed to be the star of mostfruit platters. The flavor was a little unique at first and I couldn’tdecide if I loved it or hated it. I’mkind of awatermelon and cantaloupe kind of girl, but I must admit this juicy, tropicalfruitis growing on me.

Not only is papaya sweet, juicy and tender, it’s also super healthy! Serious bonus.
Papaya is packed with Vitamins A, C, and K, and it also boasts plenty of fiber, potassium, and folate. If the health perks still don’t win you over, try cantaloupe instead! Itworks beautifully in this recipe as well.

This recipe may be my simplest yet! I don’t know where the concept originatesfrom, but it’s essentially a fruit bowl of goodness.
Simply halve your papaya or cantaloupe, scoop out the seeds, and top with whatever you can round up!
Banana ice cream
Coconut yogurt
Kiwi
Cherries
Blueberries
Chia seeds
Hemp seeds
Slivered almonds
These areso versatile you can easily adjustyour fixingsto suit your tastes.

","To make banana ice cream (instead of using dairy-free yogurt), add 2 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) ripe, previously sliced and frozen bananas to a blender or food processor and blend on low until a creamy ice cream consistency is reached. Scrape down sides as needed, and add a splash of almond milk if it has trouble blending.To assemble papaya (or cantaloupe) boats, simply fill the hollow centers with desired amounts of banana ice cream or coconut yogurt, fruit, nuts, and seeds!Enjoy immediately - best when fresh."
502,Strawberry Watermelon Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Chia Watermelon Smoothie

My grandpa Joe – who’s now 90 years old – had quite the reputation as an expert watermelongrower when I was growing up.
His patch always yielded the biggest, ripest, most brightred watermelons in town.
When you cut into them you could hear them crack, and theyfilled the air with most hypnotizing melon-y scent.
They were loaded with giant seeds that were perfect for long-distance spitting contests. And they were the absolute best treat on hot summer days.
Maybe everyone saysthis about your grandpa, too. But as far as I’m concerned, Joe will forever be the reigning champion.

If it’s not painfully clear yet, I love watermelons.
But I realized recently that I’ve never tried one in a smoothie. It seems like the perfect fit, especially in summer. I’m so glad my curiosity led me to this tasty treat.
Is it simple? Oh yes. Just 6 ingredients, 10 minutes,and 1 blender. Would I have it any other way?

It starts with ripe watermelon and some frozen ripe strawberries for a tart-sweettwist.
Lime adds a tart kick thatoffsets the sweetness of the fruit.
Almond milk createsa creamy texture, while banana adds a bit more substance and natural sweetness.
And chia seeds not only add nutrition and texture, but also mock watermelon seeds for more visual appeal. Wowza, that’s one beautiful smoothie.

I think you’ll love this smoothie. It’s:
Cold
Refreshing
Naturally sweet
A little tart
Watermelon-y (Is that a word? It is now!)
Summer appropriate
&amp; So delicious
Make this for breakfast, a snack, or a late-night, summer cool down treat. And if you do, be sure to leave a comment, rate it, and take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. Cheers, friends!

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth, adding more almond milk to thin, or more frozen strawberries or ice to thicken.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lime for acidity, banana for sweetness, or watermelon for a more intense watermelon flavor.Serves 2 (as original recipe is written) - top with additional chia seeds to mock watermelon seeds! Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for 1-2 days."
503,Pad Thai Spring Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pad Thai Spring Rolls

Pad Thai to-go, anyone? I thought you’d be on board…

Pad Thai has been one of our favorite dishesfor years, and one that I make frequently when we’re cravinga hearty, plant-based meal. (Find my standard recipe in our 31 Meals eCookbook.)
As much as I love it, Pad Thai can be a bit complicated and time consuming, which is why I’ve hesitated putting it on the blog. But by morphingitinto a spring roll and eliminating anyunnecessary ingredients, I’ve whittled this down into a portable, easy, downright deliciousmeal.
This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour to make! It’s also extremely hearty and will please the hungriest of guests. Bonus? It’s versatile.
If you aren’t into tofu, sub your favorite protein. If you don’t like spicy, leave out the chili garlic sauce. Need something for dipping? Throw in one of mythree (yes, three) sauce options.
In other words, I’ve got you covered.

The star of the rolls, in my opinion, is the crispy baked tofu that sautés up beautifully in a bit of my 5-ingredient Pad Thai sauce. But coming in a close second is the rice noodles sautéed to sticky, spicy-sweet perfection before being stuffed into spring roll wrappers.
These rolls really are delicious on their own. But when served with a little additional chili garlic sauce, Sriracha, or peanut sauce, it’s elevated to a new level of awesome.

I hope you guys LOVE these rolls! They’re:
Hearty
Fresh
Super flavorful
Subtly spiced
Perfectly sweet
Packed with fresh herbs +carrots
Crunchy
Simple
&amp; Downright delicious

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Wrap tofu in a clean towel. Set something heavy on top - such as a cast iron pan - to press out liquid for 15 minutes. Then cut into 1/2-inch wide rectangular strips.Arrange tofu on the baking sheet, giving each piece some space so it can firm up. Bake for 28-30 minutes to dry and firm the tofu. For softer tofu, bake for 20 minutes. For firmer, bake for 30-35 minutes. Set aside.In the meantime, prep carrots, cilantro, and cook rice noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.To make the sauce, add tamarind, tamari, coconut sugar, lime and chili garlic sauce to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once it begins bubbling, lower heat to low and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more tamari or soy sauce for saltiness, chili garlic for heat, coconut sugar or maple syrup for sweetness, or lime for acidity. You want it pretty flavorful with a balance of salty, sweet and sour, so don’t be shy! Remove from heat and set aside.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add baked tofu and 1 tsp each chili garlic sauce and tamari or soy sauce, plus 1 Tbsp of the Pad Thai sauce (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Sauté, stirring frequently, for 1-2 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.Add cooked noodles to the still-hot pan over medium heat and add remaining Pad Thai sauce. Use tongs to disperse sauce and toss noodles. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside.Assemble a station for preparing the spring rolls with a shallow bowl or plate (for dunking the rice paper), bring a kettle or pot of water to a boil (to cook the rice paper with), and a clean work surface (such as a large cutting board).Gather all ingredients and add hot water to the shallow bowl or pan. Let it cool for 1-2 minutes, then add 1 rice paper at a time and cook/soften for 45 seconds to 1 minute. You’ll know it’s ready when you touch it and it swirls around in the water.Lift and let excess water drip off, then transfer to your clean work surface. Top with pad thai noodles, tofu, carrots and cilantro, then roll over once, tuck in sides, and continue rolling all the way up. Place seam-side down on a serving plate or baking sheet and cover with a damp, room temperature towel to keep fresh.Continue until all spring rolls are prepared - about 8 (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve as is with a bit more chili garlic sauce or Sriracha! Another great addition is peanut, almond, or cashew butter sauce (see links to variations/recipes above).Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days."

The stuffed pepper.
It’s a beautiful thing, no?
So, why hadI never attempted it?
Thingshad to change.
This recipe was inspired by my ongoing love for Mexican food and my desire to create more plant-based, substantial entrees.
The trouble with eating less animal products is you can sometimes feel less full. But not so with these stuffed peppers! They’re hearty, filling and oh-so flavorful.
Bonus? They’re simple, requiring just 10 ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
The filling is so delicious on its own – loaded with quinoa cooked in vegetable stock, smoky spices, black beans and corn – but it becomes even more delectable once its stuffed into sweet bell peppers and roasted to perfection. Swoon!
I think you guys are going to LOVE these peppers! They’re:
SO easy to make
Super flavorful
Hearty
Filling
Healthy
&amp; Versatile
We enjoyed these recently for breakfast, but they could really be greatfor any time of day! I think they’d be especially idealfor entertaining meat eaters and vegans alike, since they’re so filling and flavorful. You know they’re good when they’re hungry-husband approved (ftw)!

Ask and you shall receive.
This recipe is a reader request and I thought it was such a great idea that I promptlymoved it way up on my to-make list!

It starts with fresh (or frozen) raspberries, which are beginning to floodgrocery stores much to my delight. They’re delicious right now and will continue reachingtheir peak flavor as they comemore into season. In other words, this isn’t my last raspberry recipe of the summer.
To keep thing simpleI kept this recipe to 8 ingredients! It’s also vegan, gluten-free, and naturally sweetened, so everyone can enjoy.

The concept is simple and fresh:
Coconut-cashew ice cream base +mashed, lightly sweetened berries added in for that “ripple,” swirl effect.
The result is a seriously creamy, tart-sweet ice cream that’s beckoning to be made this summer.
This ice cream is dreamy. It’s:
Fruity
Sweet
Tart
Super creamy
Rich
Simple

Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust sweetness as needed, adding more cane sugar or maple syrup if desired - I found 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/4 cup cane sugar to be perfect (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Transfer to a mixing bowl and cover. For best results, chill overnight or for at least 5-6 hours. If in a rush, 1 1/2 to 2 hours in the freezer is sufficient.Once your base is chilled, prepare raspberries by adding to a bowl and mashing with sweetener. Set aside.Assemble your chilled ice cream maker and pour in the chilled ice cream batter. Churn until creamy and thick and resembles soft serve - about 40-45 minutes.In the last 30 seconds of churning, add in 1/2 of the raspberries and let churn until slightly swirled. Turn off machine.Transfer ice cream to a freezer-safe container and smooth flat with a spoon, swirling in the remaining amount of raspberries. Tap on the counter to help settle and remove any air bubbles.Cover securely and freeze for 4-5 hours or until firm. Before scooping, set out for 10-15 minutes to soften.

Ok, I thought you’d be on board.

This recipe was inspired by this 30-minute Blended Chipotle Red Salsa!
This stuff was too good just to be eaten with chips. I mean, there would be absolutely no shame in that, but I had bigger hopes and dreams for this jar.

This recipe is inspired by my love for Mexican food and all theveggie burgers.
If you’ve never experimented with green chiliesbefore, you must! They’re super flavorful andavailable in both mild and hot so you to control the heat. Plus, you don’t have to do anything besides crack the can and pour them in.Hello simple.
Speaking of simple, this recipe requires just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and about10 ingredients (give or take a spice). Hello simple, indeed.

The beauty of this recipe is it’ssuper versatile when it comes to cooking method.
The burgerscan be simply sautéed and served as is for a more tender texture, or popped into the oven and baked for another 20 to 30 minutes to firm up even more. This allows you to control the tendernessand reach the ultimate texture you desire.

Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent - about 1-2 minutes.Add garlic and shallot directly to a mixing bowl. Then add drained chickpeas and use a fork or pastry cutter to mash/mix. A little texture is OK, but you only want a few whole chickpeas remaining.Add remaining ingredients, including oil, and stir/mash to combine. You want it to form into a moldable “dough.” Add more oil or lime juice if too dry, or more crushed chips if too wet. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Divide into 4 even patties (see photo // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). To help form them, line a 1/2 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap and scoop out 1/2 cup amounts (use a 1/4 cup measuring cup for 8 smaller burgers // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Press to pack, then lift out and slightly flatten with hands.Heat the same skillet you used earlier to medium heat. Once hot, add enough oil to form a thin layer on the bottom of your skillet, then add only as many burgers as will fit comfortably. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, flipping gently, and reducing heat if browning too quickly.You can either serve your burgers as is, or pop them on a baking sheet and bake in a 375-degree F (190 C) oven for an additional 15-20 minutes or more to dry/crisp them up. However, they’re great as is! The longer you bake them, the drier/firmer they’ll become.Let cool for 2-3 minutes before serving (they’ll firm up as they cool). To serve, lay down cilantro on bottom half of a toasted bun. Then top with burger, onion, salsa or green chilies, avocado or any other desired toppings.Leftover burgers will keep in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh.

Begging to be toppedwith coconut whipped cream andfresh fruit
This is my kind of dessert.

This recipe was inspired by my Best Damn Vegan Biscuits. I’ve been wondering for a while now whether a sweet, chocolate version would work as a shortcake.
Verdict? It totally does.

These shortcakes are quick and easy, requiring just 30 minutes and 1 bowl to prepare. They’re also butter-free thanks to coconut oiland naturally sweetened with coconut sugar!
If you’ve never had a shortcake before, it’s essentially a subtly sweet, flaky biscuit/cake hybrid that’s typically served with whipped cream and strawberries – the perfect casual dessert.
I’m absolutely smitten with thischocolate version. Though I haven’t tried a vanilla flavoryet, I’m sure that would work well, too!

These shortcakes are the real deal. They’re
Flaky
Tender
Warm
Chocolaty
Sweet
&amp; Satisfying
I’ve primarily enjoyed shortcakes at room temperature, but I think these are best warm since the chocolaty is still gooey.

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C) and measure out almond milk and add lemon juice (which will act as buttermilk).Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl.Add semi-firm coconut oil (if runny, chill in the freezer for about 10 minutes - it shouldn't be rock hard, but rather scoopable.) or cold butter and use fingers or a pastry cutter to combine until small pieces remain and it looks like sand.Make a well in the dry ingredients and, using a wooden spoon, stir gently while pouring in the almond milk mixture 1/4 cup at a time. You may not need all of it. Stir until just slightly combined – it will be slightly sticky but not wet. Add chocolate chips and stir once more to just incorporate.Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with a bit of flour and then very gently turn the dough over on itself 5-6 times – hardly kneading.Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible, flouring hands as needed.Use a 1-inch thick dough cutter or a similar-shape object with sharp edges (such as a cocktail shaker) and push straight down through the dough, then slightly twist.Repeat and place shortcakes on a bare baking sheet in two rows, making sure they just touch – this will help them rise uniformly. Gently reform the dough and cut out one or two more – you should have 6-7 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Brush the tops with a bit more melted coconut oil and gently press a small divot in the center using your thumb. This will help them rise evenly so the middle won’t form a dome.Bake at 450 degree for 10-15 minutes or until fluffy and the tops are firm and the middle no longer appears doughy.Let cool slightly (for 5 minutes or so), then serve warm with coconut whipped cream and fresh berries. Dust with additional cocoa powder for extra garnish.Let remaining shortcakes cool completely before storing in an airtight container or bag at room temperature (though best when fresh)."

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (196 C) and line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners, or lightly grease and flour (with GF flour) and shake out excess (which I found to work well!).Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for a few minutes.Add maple syrup, coconut sugar, oil and whisk vigorously to combine and dissolve sugar crystals.Add applesauce, peanut butter, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and apple cider vinegar and whisk to combine.Add almond milk and whisk again to combine.Lastly, add gluten free flour, almond meal, and oats and whisk or stir until just combined. The batter should be quite thick but NOT pourable – rather, scoopable.Pour batter into muffin tins a generous 3/4 full and top with 3/4 tsp strawberry jam and 1/4 tsp more peanut butter. Swirl with a toothpick to distribute (see photo), being careful not to get the jam too close to the edges or it can seep over while baking and get too browned.Bake on a center-positioned rack for 26-32 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (be sure to poke a spot that isn’t too jam heavy or you can get a little residual moisture).Let cool for 20 minutes in the pan (to continue baking/firming up a little), then loosen with a butter knife and gently lift out, using the knife to help if needed, to let cool completely on a plate. Can be a little tender before completely cooled, so be patient my young ones!Will keep covered at room temperature for several days. Freeze for long-term storage."
510,Chipotle Red Salsa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Red Salsa

Being in the kitchen all day often leaves me in takeout moodcome dinner time.
“Hi. My name is Dana and I’m a food blogger who doesn’t cook dinner.”
“Hi, Dana.”


OK, it’s not that severe. It’s just that with blog recipes and recipes for our (print!) cookbook (due out this fall!), I have a full plate, sometimes attempting three recipes a day! So is it any wonder when John asks me what’s for dinner Iconsistently vote for Mexican food? No, no it’s not.
Cha Cha Cha – thelocal restaurantthat inspired thisChili Lime Mango Margarita – also inspired this 30-minute blended salsa. Obviously, they have a good thing going and I’m rather obsessed. Something about chips, salsa and a margarita at the end of a full day just sounds magical.

This salsa – where do I begin?
It’s electric orange-red
It’s savory
It’s subtly spiced
It’s blended
It’s…perfection
I had to make it at home.

To get that beautiful dark orange huge and some natural sweetness, I opted for carrots! But I also think orange bell peppers would work beautifully here.
For that classic salsa flavor I didn’t neglect the onion, garlic, and tomato. And for some subtle heat I went with a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce – an item easily found in most grocery stores (and nearly allMexican grocery stores.)
Once everything simmers down, I throw it in the blender for an uber-smooth texture.
Chip, meet salsa.
Salsa, meet chip.
Be friends.

You guys are going to LOVE this salsa! It’s:
Savory
Smooth
Subtly spiced
Tomato-y
Dreamy
Simple
&amp; Quick
In addition to being chip’s best friend, this salsa would also make theperfect companion for pretty much every Mexican-inspired dish, including nachos, salads,salad cups, chilaquiles, breakfast tacos, panko avocado tacos, and, you get the drift. Make this salsa, put it on everything.

511,Grilled Nutella Banana Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grilled Nutella Banana Sandwich

The exact words that came to mind when I saw this gorgeousstack was “OOOOOOKKKK,” as rapper Lil Jon would say.
He mightalso say something like, “YEEAHHHHHH!” or “WHAT?”
You get the drift. This thing is amazing and worthy of all the adjectives.

This recipe is ridiculously simple andbeckoning to be made.
Just1 pan, 4 ingredients, and10 minutes until you hold this crispy, warm, sweet sandwich in your hands.
Bonus? It’s vegan (utilizing my 4-Ingredient Vegan Nutella) and butter-free, relying on coconut oil for that crispy crust.
Come to mama.

This stack is absolutely irresistible. It’s:
Crispy on the outside
Warm and melty on the inside
Chocolaty
Hazelnut-infused
Satisfying
Easy
&amp; Quick
When would one eat such a sandwich? I’m glad you asked! Anytime really, but more specificallyI think this would make the perfect indulgent lunch, snack or dessert. I mean, who wouldn’t be impressed ifyou brought this out after dinner? Can we say, instant friends?
If you try this sandwich, let us know what you think. Leave a comment, rate it, tell your mom, tell your wife, tell your kids – you get the idea. And don’t forget to tag a picture#minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. It’s literally the best. Cheers, friends!

","Heat a skillet (cast iron is best) over medium heat.In the meantime, spread a generous amount of coconut oil on the outer-facing sides of your bread, then spread a generous amount of Nutella on both sides of the inner-facing slices (see photo). Arrange sliced banana on one side and fold together to make a sandwich.Once the skillet is hot, press the sandwich down and grill until golden brown and crispy - about 2-4 minutes. Lower heat if browning too quickly. Flip and repeat on the other side. Repeat until desired crispiness is achieved.Slice in half and serve immediately! This would be amazing with some homemade almond milk. Optional additions are listed above, though this sandwich is quite delicious on its own."
512,Coconut No-Bake Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut No-Bake Cookies

Hello friends! How are you doing on this fine day?
I’m doing well. It’s practically summer, it’s nearlythe weekend, and as I type I have one of these fudgy cookies at my side. In other words, life is good.

I was inspired to make these cookiesafter having such great success with my 5-Ingredient Dark Chocolate Macaroons.With all the fun I’ve been having with coconut lately, I figured I’d keep playing around with chocolate-coconut creations.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and 30 minutes (give or take) from start to finish. And, there’s no baking involved, hence the name. These cookies really are a 1-pot wonder.

Another perk? These beauties are naturally sweetened with coconut sugar, and instead of butter I relied on coconut oil and peanut butter. They’re also infused with coconut flakes for an extra coconutty vibe.
I guess you could say this is a no bakecookie with a healthy twist.

One bite in and it was magic. These cookies are:
Simple
Chocolaty
Naturally sweetened + perfectly sweet
Coconut infused
Peanut buttery
Quick
Delicious
These would make a great dessert for road trips, picnics or when you need something quick to whip up for entertaining. Or, if you’re like me, they make a great Tuesday cookie – just because.
Wehope you love this recipe! If you try it be sure to take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see!We love seeing what you come up with. Cheers, friends!

","Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper.Add coconut sugar, almond milk, cocoa powder, and coconut oil to a medium saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat, stirring frequently.Once bubbling, let boil for 1 minute. Then remove from heat and add peanut butter, oats, shredded coconut, vanilla and salt and stir to combine + fully incorporate all ingredients.Drop heaping Tablespoon amounts (I used this cookie scoop!) of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with crushed peanuts and/or additional flaked coconut (optional).Let sit at room temperature until cooled and hardened - about 25-30 minutes.Keep leftovers covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, though best when fresh."
513,Gluten-Free Nutella Banana Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Nutella Banana Bread (Vegan + GF)

The obsession with banana bread (hello 1, 2,3, and 4) and Nutella continues!


For those of you who made my 4-Ingredient Nutella a fewweeks back, you’re in luck! I have the perfect recipe for you to put it to good use.
This banana breadrequires just 1 bowl, is both vegan and gluten-free,and gets a decadent touch from a thick Nutella swirl. What more could you ask for?

After some quality time in the oven it comes out looking like heaven in a loaf pan. But resist the temptation to digin right away! Due to the mix of gluten free flours and the flax egg, it’s a bit more tender and benefits greatly from cooling completely.
Bonus? It’s even more amazing the next day!

I think you guys are going to LOVE this bread! It’s:
Moist
Tender
Hearty
Perfectly sweet
Banana-infused
Nutella-swirled
Wholesome
Easy
&amp; Quick!
This bread makes the perfect take-along breakfast, snack, or even a dessert. I absolutely adore the way the Nutella bakes into the top layer and creates a chocolate-hazelnut crust. I found myself grabbing for the top of the slice and really savoring it.

514,Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake

Let’s talk first jobsand ice cream.
One of my first workinggigs was at a soda shop attached toa movie theatre – Midwest theaters did it right. I was about 16 and I snaggedthe job “soda jerk,” which meant I scooped all the ice cream sundaes, shakes, apple pie a la modes, and made fresh cherry limeades. Basically, I looked and smelled like a giant popsicle by the end of the night.
It was kind of the dream, except for two things: 1) Restockinginvolved lugging dozens of 10-pound ice cream containers around with my weak chicken arms. And 2) being around ice cream all day. Hello temptation.

My favorite flavor combination has always been some form of chocolate, banana, and peanut butter. I’m surprised I never put bananas and peanut butter cups between breadand called it lunch (but now that I think of it, that’s a good idea).
We were allowed a minimal amount of treats while at work and only received a small discount on food, but that never stopped me from ordering giant salads during my lunch break and then whipping up a hot fudge peanut butter banana shake for my car ride home. Life was good.

Not much has changed these days. I still love all things peanut butter, banana and chocolate. However, with dairy out the door,I reach for cashew- and coconut-based frozen treats. Another favorite – and perhaps the most simple creation – involves frozen bananas.
This recipe is has threevery good things going for it:
1) It requires just 5 ingredients and 5minutes to make.
2) It’s naturally sweetened and relativelyhealthy.
3) It tastes seriously close to a real milkshake!

Frozen bananas provide a sweet, ice cream-likebase
Dates a touchof sweetness
Almond milk extra creaminess
Peanut butter a salty kick +protein +healthy fats
&amp; cacao powder antioxidants and subtlechocolate flavor
This has been my go-to mid-afternoon snack when I can’t quite make it till dinner or a healthy dessert when I want something sweet. But really, it’s so healthy and satisfying that it could even be a suitable breakfast.

","Add all ingredients except almond milk to the blender. Add in almond milk 1/2 cup at a time, adding only enough to allow the ingredients to blend together. Add more for a thinner shake and less for a thicker shake.Taste and adjust flavors, adding more banana or dates for sweetness, cacao for chocolate flavor, and peanut butter for saltiness. Optional: Add a handful of ice for extra thickness.Serves 1 generously (as original recipe is written). Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the fridge for up to 24 hours. You could even freeze this into popsicles!"
515,Simple Blackberry Cobbler | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Blackberry Cobbler (Vegan + GF)

It’s almost summer. Can you feel it?
When I think of summer, cobblers,crisps, and ice creamcome to mind. Also, bike rides, beachtrips and patio drinks. What about you?
This summer I’m determinedto further explore my love for berries, starting with this simple blackberry cobbler. Shall we begin?
There’s something extremely romantic and effortless about a fruit cobbler to me. I suppose it’s because it’s a dump, mix, and bake sort of recipe – my favorite kind.
I’ve tried crisps in the past but never a cobbler. My family wasn’t big on cobblers, so I seemed to have missed them altogether. Sad day. I was determined to change that.
And to ensure everyone can enjoy this recipe, I kept it both vegan and gluten free. Bonus? Just 1 bowl and roughly 30 minutes required.
It starts with a lightly-sweetened, 5-minutebiscuit-inspired topping that’s vegan butter-free, relying instead on coconut oil to give it that quintessential crumbly, flaky texture.
Then, it’s onto the blackberries, which aretossed in sweetener (coconut or cane sugar) and a bit of arrowroot to thicken.
A sprinkle of pecans and coconut sugar finish it off before going into the oven. This is the perfect time to make some coconut whipped cream or soften some dairy-free ice cream. What’s a cobbler without toppings, after all?
This cobbler is dreamy. It’s:
Warm
Fruity
Crumbly
Tender
Perfectly sweet
A little tart
Simple + quick
&amp; Perfect for summer gatherings
This would make the perfect dessert to whip up for guests or warm-weather gatherings. It’s so effortless and easy, yet makes you look like a pro, especially when baked in a cast iron – so fancy.
The best part about this recipe is it’s versatile:
No gluten free flour? Sub all purpose.
No blackberries? Sub another fruit (such as raspberries, blueberries, or nectarines)
No coconut oil? Sub vegan butter.
No pecans? Sub walnuts or omit.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and butter a 12-inch cast-iron (or similar sized) pan with vegan butter or coconut oil. Set aside.Add all dry topping ingredients to a mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Also measure out almond milk and add lemon juice to begin curdling.Add vegan butter or coconut oil to the dry ingredients and use a fork or pastry cutter to cut it in. It should resemble the consistency of fine, wet sand.Add almond milk mixture a little at a time, stirring, until a dough is formed. It shouldn’t be too sticky - you will likely not use it all.Transfer to a lightly floured surface (with gluten free flour) and form into a disc with your hands. Set aside to rest.Add berries to the same mixing bowl and toss with sugar and arrowroot or cornstarch and then add to the buttered cast iron.Gently break the biscuit topping apart and position it on top of the blackberries in clumps. Press down gently so it doesn't stick up too much (see photo).Sprinkle the top with 1-2 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) additional cane or coconut sugar and the chopped pecans. Bake for 20-28 minutes, or until bubbly and the topping is browned (see photos) and semi-firm to the touch.Serve with dairy-free ice cream or coconut whipped cream. Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh as the topping tends to get soggy."
516,Vegan Biscuits and Gravy | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Biscuits and Gravy

In my teenage years, my high school hada late start day everyWednesday, wherein school started 1.5 hours later than normal. AKA awesome.
Obviously, Wednesdays were my favorite. Bed bums unite!
My best friend Danielle and I had a standard late-start routine:
Sleep in.
Roll out of bed.
Go to our local donut shop.
Order biscuits and gravy. (Yes, B+G at a donut shop.)
Devour biscuits and gravy in thecar on ourway to school.
Roll into schoolwith a buddha belly.
Life, was, good.
It’s been awhile since I’ve had a proper plateof biscuits and gravy, but oh how I miss it. The flaky biscuits slathered in the thick, creamy gravy – swoon.It was due time Itried my hand at a vegan version.
This recipe requires just30 minutes total. Just whip up your gravy while your biscuits are bakingaway.
If you’ve never made mushroom gravy, get ready to fall in love. The mushrooms provide a hearty, almost meaty texture and flavor, while thewalnuts add extra protein and bite. And, just like my dad taught me, don’t forget a hearty shake of pepper for a bit of heat.



Mmm. Just look at that tall stack of goodness just waiting to be covered in gravy. Hello breakfast.
I am swooning over this recipe. It’s:
Warm
Savory
Hearty
Flaky
Comforting
&amp; Simple
This makes the perfect special weekend breakfast, or hearty “breakfast for dinner.” Bonus? If you have leftover biscuitsyou should totally slather them in vegan butter and jam. Trust me – serious win.

517,White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecake (Vegan + GF)

You know a recipe is good when:
A) You get hungry all over again looking at the photos.
B) You pawn leftovers off on neighbors because the temptation is too much to handle.
C) You drop a piece on the table while cleaning up and eat it with your hands. #truestory
D) You simply cannot wait to share it.
This recipe satisfiesall of the above. Who’s ready for some (vegan, gluten-free) cheesecake!?

After having such great success with my No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecakes, I couldn’t shake the thought that it was the cocoa butter in the dark chocolate that helped the cheesecakes firm up and hold their shape so well even unrefrigerated(a complaint I had with my earliest prototype– still delicious, just a little soft).
So Iordered some cocoa butterto test my hypothesis.Spoiler alert – my suspicions were dead on.

This cheesecake is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl (or blender/food processor). And it all starts with a simple, 3-ingredient crust of dates, walnuts and sea salt.
Then, it’s onto the filling.
This filling is insanely creamy and rich. Bonus? It’s entirely naturally sweetened thanks to maple syrup.
It gets its tartness from lemon juice and just a hint of apple cider vinegar. And the subtle, white chocolate flavor comes from the melted cocoa butter.
One bite in and my eyes rolled back. That’s when you know it’s a keeper.

I hope you guys love this cheesecake. It’s:
Creamy
Rich
Decadent
Naturallysweetened
Perfectly tart
Infused with white chocolate
Seriously close to “real” cheesecake
&amp; Insanely delicious

(P.S. If you’re weary to purchase cocoa butter just for this recipe, fear not! You can also use it for beauty purposes and I intend to use it in some future recipes – like this one!)

","Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Next add nuts, salt and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal.Cut out parchment paper into circles the shape of your ramekins, muffin tins or pan (see notes for size options). In addition, to make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut out two strips of parchment paper per ramekin and lay them in an ""X"" shape at the base. Top with circle shape. This creates little tabs that make removing the cheesecakes easier to pop out once set.Divide crust among serving dishes and carefully press with fingers to distribute. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to really press it down, allowing some crust to come up the sides. If it sticks, separate the crust and glass with a small piece of parchment paper. Set in fridge or freezer to firm up.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth - up to 2-3 minutes. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice, maple syrup/agave or a splash more almond milk as the liquid should help it blend better.Scrape down sides as needed and blend until very creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed.Divide filling evenly among the ramekins (or other serving dish). Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set - about 6-8 hours depending on size of dish. Expedite this process by popping them into the freezer for at least 2 hours. NOTE: They will come out much easier after being in the freezer!Once set, run a butter knife along the edge and gently remove by tugging on the tabs in an upward motion. They should pop right out. If they aren't quite set, pop them in the freezer for 15-20 minutes and they should come out easily.Top with a touch of coconut whipped cream and fresh berries, or as is! See notes for storage."
518,Green Chickpea Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Green Chickpea Curry with Couscous

I love it when recipes are inspired by a fond memory or an especiallyexceptionalmeal. This recipe isinspired by both.

During a recent trip back to Kansas for some freelance work, we spent the evening with my parents at Public – one of ourfavorite restaurants in Wichita.
They had a chickpea curry on special and I couldn’t resist. I love trying vegan dishes at otherwise non-vegan restaurants just to see what they have to offer. I was so pleasantly surprised bythis dish and itfar exceeded my expectations.

This dish is a cross between a stew and a traditional curry, with the addition of Israeli couscous to give it more body and texture.
It’s also quick and simple – requiring just 1 pot and about 30 minutes to prepare. And it’s extremely versatile (see notes to keep it gluten free).
The primary flavor comes from green curry paste – a new-to-me ingredient that will no doubt bestocked in my pantry from now on. It’s a slightly more mild curry with a vibrant green color thanks tocoriander, cumin, cilantro and lemongrass (just to name a few). I think I’m in love.

As your curry simmers away, it’s time to prepare your toppings.
I went with pan-fried tofu for extra texture and protein, but it’s completely optional! The dish really is delicious and filling on its own. A few other options include sriracha, bean sprouts, shredded Brussels sprouts, lime juice, and cilantro. So much yum.

I think you guys are going to LOVE this dish. It’s:

I added a bit more of each as you really want the flavor to be big, bold and punch through in each bite. Don’t be shy!Then turn off heat and let rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavor to permeate the chickpeas and couscous even more.Serve with fresh lime juice, fresh herbs, sriracha, and just a sprinkle more coconut sugar (trust me! the flavor payoff is big). You can also serve with pan-seared tofu (instructions below) and/or bean sprouts or shredded Brussels sprouts."

Oh, sweet potatoes.

The way your edgesget crisp and your centers remain tender.
The way you complement spicy flavorsso well.
The way you pair withMexican foodlike besties.
The way you’re always there for me when I’m starving but feeling so verylazy.
Today, I’m adding one more way to love sweet potatoes. Hope you don’t mind.

Wedges may be one of my favorite ways to eat potatoes. When I was a kid, a lot of fast food restaurants served potato wedges and, besides curly or waffle (obviously), wedgeswere where it was at.
The edges get all crispy and browned and the centers remain soft and tender. And with the addition of a little salt, you get that perfect mix of savory and sweet – a contrast I adore.
Another perk of this preparation style? Just 30 minutes start to finish and the whole recipe (including sauce) requires just 7 ingredients!

The only thing missing from straight up fries is a dipping sauce. There must always bea dipping sauce.
There’s something delicious about honey mustard sauce and despite many attempts, I’ve never able to recreate it at home to the quality and flavor I wanted. That is, until now!
A base of cashew butter makesa neutral, creamy base and lets the flavor of the mustard punch through. And in place of honey, I opted for maple syrup asa natural sweetener. The result was perfect.Friends, I think this may be love.

520,Coconut Yogurt Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Yogurt Waffles (Vegan + GF)

My mom used to coax me out of bed in the morning with one oftwo things: Pancakes or Eggo waffles.
I pretty much grew up on carbs. Does a body good, right?
The waffle obsession continued into college. Saturdays were reserved for banana pancakes after a long distance run. Sundays – a day of utter relaxation – was inauguratedwith two whole grain Eggo waffles topped with copious amounts of crunchy salted peanut butter, sliced bananas, and honey. It was sheer breakfast heaven.

Not much has changed these days, other than the fact that I don’t buy store bought waffles anymore. I am an adult, after all.
I started making vegan waffles for Minimalist Baker early on. But when some of our friends needed to eat gluten-free, I started dabbling in the gluten-free variety.
Once I got the hang of it, I realized it wasn’t too difficult to make them both vegan and gluten-free.

This recipe is very basic, requiring 10 ingredients and just 30 minutesto make.
It relies on my go-to gluten-free flour blend, almond meal and rolled oats. But if you’re not gluten free, simply sub the GF blend for spelt or whole wheat pastry flour for a similar result! And dairy-free coconut (vanilla) yogurt provides a tender texture and subtle sweetness.


I let John sample one of these hot off the press and he immediately said they tasted like Eggo waffles. Serious win!
Crisp on the outside
Tender +fluffy on the inside
&amp; Perfectly sweet
This is exactly what I was going for.


For toppings, the options are endless:
Nutella
Coconut whip
Dairy-free yogurt
Compote
Peanut butter
Banana
Chia Seeds

","Combine almond milk and lemon juice or vinegar in a medium-size mixing bowl and let set for 5 minutes.Then add yogurt, coconut oil, vanilla extract, maple syrup and whisk thoroughly to combine. Set aside. (If coconut oil hardens, reheat in the microwave. If you don't have a microwave, simply proceed as instructed.)Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Let set for 10 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. (I set mine to 4 out of 5 for a crispier waffle, but adjust yours according to preference.)Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or coconut oil and pour on about 1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a cooling rack set on a baking sheet in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm (optional). Do not stack and instead keep them in a single layer to ensure crispiness.Serve immediately with desired toppings. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results. Will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month, although they're freshest within the first couple of weeks."
521,Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl

One might assume by calling this a “Buddha Bowl” I’m making some kind of political or religious statement, when in fact, I am not. I just like giantbowls of food.
A “Buddha Bowl,” as defined by urban dictionary, is “a bowl which is packed so full that it has a rounded ‘belly’ appearance on the top much like the belly of a buddha.”
That’s my kind of dinner. Let’s do this!

I first heard of Buddha Bowls somewhere within the vegan (&amp; hippy) community and personally understand them asa big bowl of plant-based goodness, which is precisely what this recipe is!
What started off as a mission to make a chickpea breakfast skillet turned into a sweet and savory dish that would satisfy vegans and meat-eaters alike.
Plus, it’s simple – requiring just 30 minutes. And it’s ridiculously healthy – loaded with four kinds of vegetables, fiber- andprotein-rich chickpeas, and a maple-tahini sauce that’s so good you’ll want to put it on everything.

It all starts by roasting your vegetables in the oven. Whilethose are baking away, simply sauté your chickpeas to crispy perfection andwhiskup your 3-ingredient tahini sauce.
All that’s left to do is put it all together and take your taste buds to flavor town.

This bowlis literally all I’ve been craving since perfectingthis recipe. It’s:
Savory + Sweet
Subtly spiced
Warm
Comforting
Incredibly satisfying
Seriously healthy
&amp;Packed with flavor

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and arrange sweet potatoes and onions on a bare baking sheet. Drizzle both with a bit of oil, making sure the flesh of the sweet potatoes are well coated and placed skin side down on the sheet.Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven flip sweet potatoes and add broccolini. Drizzle broccolini with a bit of oil and season with a pinch each salt and pepper.Bake for another 8-10 minutes, then remove from oven and add kale. Drizzle kale with a touch more oil and season with a pinch each salt and pepper. Bake for another 4-5 minutes then set aside.While vegetables are roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with seasonings.Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil (amount as original recipe is written // use half of total amount if altering batch size) and chickpeas and sauté, stirring frequently. If they’re browning too quickly, turn down heat. If there isn’t much browning going on, increase heat. I found 10 minutes total at slightly over medium heat was perfect.Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set aside.Prepare sauce by adding tahini, maple syrup and lemon juice to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Add hot water until a pourable sauce is formed. Set aside.To serve: Slice sweet potatoes into bite size pieces. Divide vegetables between 3 serving bowls and top with chickpeas + tahini sauce.Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep for a few days in the fridge."
522,Super Green Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Green Smoothie Bowl

I’vebeen drinking a green smoothie for breakfast for about five years now.
There’s a certain sense of accomplishment that comes with working out and getting in two servings each of fruit and vegetables before 10 a.m.
But have you heard the new thing about smoothies? You can put them in BOWLS. Yes, bowls. Why, you ask?
Because youcan make them into even more of a complete meal with the simple addition of a few blend-in ingredients and toppings. Count me in!

This smoothie bowl is absolutely delicious. Plus, it’s simple (as always), requiring just 10 minutes to make, and entirely customizable. I provide a basic round-up of ingredients for you to startwith so you canthen experiment and make this bowl your own.
The basic idea, in my opinion, is to make a slightly thicker, more nutritionally dense smoothie (with things like avocado and nut butter) and then top it with some game-changing ingredients, like coconut, hemp seeds, granola, nut butters, etc. You get the drift.
Basically, anything in your pantry that will take your smoothie from tide-me-over snack to seriously-substantial meal.


My ideal green smoothie bowl has:
Super bright green color (achieved with lighter-colored berries and loads of greens)
Nut butter for extra protein
Avocado for healthy fats and richness
Flaxseed meal for fiber
And natural sweetness from frozen bananas

When it comes to toppings, afew of my favorites include:
Roasted unsalted sunflower seeds
Grain-Free Granola
Unsweetened coconut
Fresh berries
&amp; Hemp seeds
I also think coconut butter, peanut butter, or even a crumbled-up Coconut Berry Muffin would be amazing! Dream big, people – the options are endless.

I hope you guys LOVE this recipe and make it your own.

","Add all smoothie ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Add more almond milk (or water) to thin.Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more ripe banana (or maple syrup) for added sweetness, more spinach for a bright green hue, or almond milk for creaminess.For the green smoothie, I used strawberries, which let the green color come through more. For the purple bowl, I used darker berries (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries).For more protein, add nut butter! This also offsets / enhances the natural sweetness of the smoothie.Divide between 2 serving bowls (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings!Best when fresh, though leftovers can be kept in jars in the fridge for up to 1-2 days."
523,Chili Lime Mango Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chili Lime Mango Margaritas

If you don’t know I’m a margarita lover by now, now you know.
But do I have a mangoversion? No, despite mango being one of my favorite fruits.
I think you know where this is going.

A couple of weeks ago, I had one of those days whereI’d been in the kitchen for one too many hours and didn’t feel like cooking. Mexican food to the rescue.
There’s always Chipotle, but one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants just took over a space just a few blocks from our apartment, so we hiked over there to satisfy our cravings.
Best. Decision. Ever.

We sat down and the margaritas were calling. We went with a spicy citrus one and it was perfect – tangy and sweet with a kick.One sip and I immediatelyfelt inspired to make a version of my own at home.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 minutesand less than10ingredients! And it’s extremely customizable.
Use frozen mango (or other fruit of choice) for a blended frozen margarita, or use un-chilled mango and serve overice for an “on the rocks” application.
For a littleheatto balance out the sweetness of the mango,I add some hot sauce and chili powder on the rim. But you could omit these if you aren’t into spicy things.

I think you guys are going to love this margarita! It’s:
Super fruity
Citrusy
Boozy
Perfectly sweet
Subtly spiced
Refreshing
&amp; Seriously delicious
This is the perfect drink for spring and summer, and goes greatwith pretty much allMexican food – probably my favorite food of all. Who’s with me?

","Add all margarita ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust sweetness / strength of alcohol as desired.To chill, either blend in a large handful of ice cubes to make a frozen margarita or transfer half of the mixture to a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice and shake vigorously.Rim serving glasses with a lime wedge and immediately dip in salt/chili powder mixture (or sub just salt or sugar), and fill with 1 large ice cube or several small. Pour over margarita and garnish with lime wedge."
524,Vegan Dark Chocolate Macaroons | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Dark Chocolate Macaroons

For being a former coconut hater, I sure do love itnow.
Whether it’s a side effect of giving up dairy and relying more on cashews and coconutsor the maturing of my palette, I’m all for coconut these days. So it was only natural that I tried my hand at macaroons.
Spoiler alert – nailed it.

Traditionally, macaroons contain sweetened condensed milkand eggs.
But to keep minevegan friendly, I skipped the eggs altogether and sweetened them withmaple syrup! This simple swap kept themnaturally sweetened and still seriously delicious.
Another perk? These are easy to make! Just30 minutes from start to finish, and it all starts withblending your baseingredients in a blender or food processor.

Once you have your base sweetened and the consistency of a dough, scoop out Tablespoon-size amounts and arrange them on a greased baking sheet. Then, bake away!

These little guys brown up quickly, caramelizing the underside and giving a slight crust to the outside, while keeping the centers tender.
And the last (and perhaps most important) step – the dark chocolate dip!


These macaroons are legit! They’re:
Chocolaty
Coconutty
Perfectly sweet
Vanilla-infused
Crisp on the outside
Tender on the inside
Naturally sweetened
&amp; Perfect for spring
While these may not be as fluffy as traditional macaroons (due to the lack of eggs), the flavor is spot on and I actually prefer the slightly dense texture. So much coconutty goodness happening here.
And I’m happy to report that they’re husband approved – a big perk in my books.


If you make these macaroons, please let us know! Leave a comment and rate it. And don’t forget to take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease a baking sheet (or line with parchment paper though the bottoms won’t get as browned).Add coconut to a food processor or high-speed blender and blend, scraping down sides as needed, until not quite coconut butter. You want the texture to feel like a dough if you squeeze it between your fingers. If you went too far, add more coconut and it should firm back up.Add maple syrup and vanilla and mix again until just incorporated.Using a 1.5 Tbsp scoop (like this one) OR a 1 Tablespoon, scoop out enough coconut to fit inside the scoop and pack firmly with your hands to get an even shape, then use your finger or the loosening device to slide it out into the shape of a half circle. Gently lay on baking sheet and continue until all coconut is used - about 10 macaroons for a 1.5 Tablespoon scoop and 15-20 for a 1 Tablespoon scoop (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Brush the tops lightly with melted coconut oil and sprinkle with leftover crumbs on top. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges/bottoms are golden brown. Set aside.While macaroons are cooling, melt chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments.Once cooled, pick up macaroons and dip in the chocolate, allowing it to come up over the edges slightly. Be gentle as the macaroons can be fragile. Wipe away excess with a spoon.Place macaroons on a parchment-lined plate and repeat until all bites are coated. Let set before eating.Once set, peel away from parchment and transfer to a serving platter. Will keep covered at room temp for several days or in the freezer for several weeks (though best when fresh)."
525,Peanut Butter Cheese Crackers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Cheese Crackers (Vegan + GF)

This recipe is all about reviving a favorite childhood snack of mine – Cheesy Peanut Butter Crackers! In the name of (not-so-sophisticated) snacking, let’s do this!

Assuming you’ve ever been into a gas station and fell to the temptation of peanut butter cheese crackers, I’m guessing you know they’re a thing and they’re ridiculously delicious.
I used to eat them all the time growing up asthey’re one of my favorite road trip snack foods.
Road trips + trashysnacks = best time ever. It’s science.

Since cutting dairy completely out of my diet I’veavoided these crackers at all cost. Anything remotely cheese-esque is a no go for me. So naturally, I had to make it my mission to make a dairy- and gluten-free version for everyone’s enjoyment.
You’re (seriously) welcome.

These crackers are modified from my DIY Vegan Cheez Its – a serious classic on our site.
However, I think since the last time I’ve made them I’ve wised up a bit on gluten free baking and have made these even better! Not to brag and all but, I totally upgraded them.

While your crackers are baking away it’s time to whip up your peanut butter filling. It’s SO simple.
Two ingredients (peanut butter + maple syrup) and you’re good to go. A creamy, slightly sweet peanut butter filling just waiting to be smashed between two “cheese” crackers.

These crackers are crazyclose to the real thing! They’re:
Tender with a subtle bite
Savory
Cheesy
Peanut buttery
&amp; Afternoon-snack-worthy

You don’t want too much water, so go easy on it and add a little at a time. It shouldn’t need more than 4 Tbsp (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Remove from processor or mixing bowl and form into a loose ball with your hands. It’s good for this dough to be worked and warmed by the heat of your hands. However, you are not kneading it, just forming it into a disc.Transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface and dust the top with flour. Lay plastic wrap or wax paper and roll 1/8th inch thick with a rolling pin. Use a knife, pizza cutter or small cut cookie cutter shape to cut the dough into squares. Makes about 40 squares (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Optional: dot the centers with a fork prong or chopstick.Bake for 15-20 minutes or until puffy and slightly golden brown. These are pretty tender. For a crispier cracker, bake until golden brown.Remove from oven and let cool completely. In the meantime, whisk together your peanut butter and sweetener and set aside.Once cooled, use a butter knife to spread a small amount (~1 tsp) onto a cracker and top it with a cracker of a similar size/shape.Serve immediately. Store leftovers covered at room temp for up to a few days, though best when fresh! Though I haven’t tried it myself, I would assume that freezing these would work well."
526,Easy Vegan Nutella | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Nutella (Vegan + GF)

Confession: This one time, in college, I ate a half jar of Nutella…in one evening…after dinner…on Ritz crackers.
Oh, don’t act like I’m the only one with no self-control.

This recipe is a reader request! I’m smitten withnut butters and shocked I haven’t attempted one with hazelnuts yet. Things had to change.

This recipe is simple requiring just 4 ingredients and 30 minutes start to finish.
It’s also delicious, vegan, gluten-free, and ridiculously close to the real thing. Win-win!
It all starts with the hazelnuts, roasted to warm up the natural oils and loosen the skins. Then blendy blend!

It all happens so fast.
The nuts turn into butter and then you add the melted chocolate and give it a whirl and WHOA – you have homemade Nutella on your hands!
The only thing left to do is figure out what to put it on…
Waffles
Pancakes
Toast
Cakes
Cupcakes
Banana Bread
A spoon
The options…oh, the glorious options.

I think you guys are going to love this spread! It’s
Creamy
Chocolaty
Rich
Perfectly sweet
Spreadable
Simple
&amp; Versatile
I tested this recipe two ways, knowing not everyone would want the melted-chocolate version. Although the melted chocolate yields a much creamier, superior Nutella, you can also substitute cacao or cocoa powder and sweeten it with maple syrup (see notes).
See the texture/color difference below. Either way, still delicious!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and add hazelnuts to a baking sheet in a single layer. If raw, roast for a total of 12-15 minutes. If already roasted, roast for 8-10 minutes just to warm the natural oils and loosen the skins. This will make it easier to blend into butter.Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Then transfer to a large kitchen towel and use your hands to roll the nuts around and remove most of the skins (see photo). You want to get as much as possible off because it yields a creamier Nutella. But it doesn’t have to be perfect!Leaving excess skin behind, add hazelnuts to a food processor or high-speed blender. Blend on low until a butter is formed - about 8-10 minutes total - scraping down sides as needed.In the meantime, heat the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Set aside.Once the hazelnut butter is creamy and smooth, add the vanilla and salt and blend well. Then add melted chocolate a little at a time and blend again until well incorporated. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt or vanilla if desired.If your Nutella isn’t sweet enough, add stevia to taste, or 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup or agave (amount as original recipe is written). NOTE: Just know the more liquid sweetener you add the firmer/stiffer the Nutella will get, so add sparingly.Transfer to a clean jar and store at room temperature for everyday use for 2-3 weeks or more."
527,Coconut Sugar Caramelized Plantains | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Sugar Caramelized Plantains

It’s not often that I eat dinner solo these days, but one recent evening when John was away, I walked to our local Whole Foods andwent straight forthe hot food and salad bar.
Have you ever been there? That place is like magic!

It was there that I fell in love with caramelized plantains. Oh mama.
One bite in and I immediately knew I had to recreate them for the blog.
I’m not sure what fats or sugars areused in their version, but I wanted to clean things up and infuse some extra flavor.
More flavor is always better in my opinion.

Instead of relying on brown or cane sugar, I went with coconut sugar – a more natural sugar extracted from sap of cut flower buds on the coconut palm. Crazy awesome, right?
A lot of you guys have been asking me if I ever use it and have also been subbing it in a lot of our recipes for cane sugar, and it got me curious. So thanks for the tip!
I haven’t done much baking with it yet (recommendations / tips welcome), but what I do know is it works fabulously for caramelizing.

This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients and 15 minutes. And the flavor pay off is HUGE.
To ensure the plantains got nice and brown I went for coconut oil, which infuses a little extra flavor. And I doused the plantains in coconut sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt before throwing them in the pan – a cast iron is ideal if you have one.

What happens next is pure magic. The outside of the plantains get all brown, caramelized and sweet, and the inside gets extremely tender and melt-in-your-mouth worthy.
Can we say, new favorite dessert?

I think you guys are going to LOVE this dessert! It’s:
Warm
Super flavorful
Caramelized
Perfectly sweet
Satisfying
Quick
&amp;Naturally sweetened!
I served my plantainswith some coconut whipped cream and additional sprinkle of coconut sugar. So good!
But I also think they would be amazing with my Coconut Sea Salt Caramel Ice Cream! Can we say best vegan ice cream sundae ever?

","Heat a large cast iron or metal skillet over medium-high heat and chop your plantains in 1/2 inch slices.Add to a mixing bowl and toss with coconut sugar, cinnamon, and sea salt.Once the skillet is hot, add coconut oil and only as many plantains as will fit comfortably in the pan without crowding. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until browned and caramelized.Serve warm with dairy-free ice cream or coconut whipped cream. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the fridge covered for a few days."
528,Quinoa Spring Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Spring Rolls with Cashew Dipping Sauce

If you haven’t been able to tell, I kind of have a thing for spring rolls. For instance:
Vietnamese Spring Rolls with Crispy Tofu
Rainbow Spring Rolls
Banh Mi Spring Rolls
Are you really surprised that I now have a quinoa version? I didn’t think so.

These 30-minute spring rolls start with the protein-rich super grain quinoa.
Protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, nutty flavor, light texture – any of this ringing a bell?
I believe I’ve only just tapped into the potential of quinoa (in burgers, curries, wraps, salads), and I can’t wait to share this new application with you.
While your quinoa is cooking away, prep your vegetables and herbs. I went with cucumber, red pepper, carrots, cilantro, and mint. But it’s so versatile that you can use whatever you have on hand. I think asparagus, avocado, radish, and even orange would be lovely additions.

All that’s left to do is roll it all together and then prepare your cashew dipping sauce!
This sauce is seriously flavorful, super dreamy and perfect for these rolls. Plus, it’s peanut-free yet mocks the flavor of peanut sauce. It’s straight-up taste bud trickery, I tell you.


I think you guys are going to LOVE these rolls! They’re:

Then add 2 cups water (amount as original recipe is written // if altering batch size, use 1:2 ratio quinoa to water), bring to a low boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed and it's light and fluffy in texture.Prep vegetables and herbs and set aside.Prepare cashew butter sauce by adding all sauce ingredients except water to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Add enough hot water to thin until a pourable sauce is achieved. Adjust flavors as needed (I often add a little more chili garlic sauce and sweetener).To add more flavor to the quinoa, add 1 Tbsp soy sauce + 1/2 lime, juiced (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and toss to coat. Set aside.To assemble spring rolls, pour very hot water into a shallow dish or skillet and immerse rice paper to soften for about 10-15 seconds.Transfer to a damp cutting board or similar surface and gently spread out into a circle. It may take a little practice, so don’t feel bad if your first few attempts fail!To the bottom third of the wrapper add a generous spoonful of quinoa, and layer carrots, bell peppers, cucumber, and fresh herbs on top (see photo). Gently fold over once, tuck in edges, and continue rolling until seam is sealed.Place seam-side down on a serving platter and cover with damp warm towel to keep fresh. Repeat until all fillings are used up – about 8-10 spring rolls total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve with cashew butter sauce and sriracha or hot sauce of choice.

530,Kale Salad with Tandoori-Roasted Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas

Sometimes a girl just needs a hearty kale salad.
There’s no explaining why; she just does.
So move out of the way and give her that kale salad.
She deserves it. That and the chocolate. Give her all of the chocolate.

Since my first few experiences with kale, wherein I couldn’t figure out how tomask itsbitterness or sturdytexture, I’ve grown to love this shrubby green.
When prepared right, it makes the perfect additionto smoothies, salads, breakfast scrambles, and dips. I’ve recently been loving it in salads because it’s heartier than other greens – such as spinach – and leaves me feeling full and satisfied.
Not to mention, nutrients. So, many, nutrients.

The dressing comes together quick and packs tons of garlicky flavor, thanks to quick roasted garlic! If you’ve ever roasted a head of garlic, you know the struggle of waiting the grueling hour of cooking until itscompletion. Longest hour of my life.
But you guys know I’m impatient (30 minutes or lessring a bell?). So I crafted a way to quick-roast garlic by separating the cloves.
Then you only have to wait 20 minutes. Guys, think ofall the things you can do with that 40 minutes you get back in your life. Cartwheels, dancing, hugging, snacking. You can do whatever you want with it. You’re welcome.


The other star of this recipe? The tandoori-roasted chickpeas. I made a Masala Tofu Scramblea while back and fell in love with this smoky spice combination.
The good news is, if you’re aspecialityspice newblike me, Whole Foods has a Tandoori Spice Mix that’s to die for. I recommend looking for that next time you’re there! Otherwise, I have notes for how to make your own with just a few ingredients.


Once your (quick) roasted garlic-tahini dressing comes together, all that’s left to do is pour, toss, and top it with chickpeas! Then go to flavor town. My treat.

This salad is my absolute new favorite. It’s:
Hearty
Savory
Garlicky
Subtly spiced
Super healthy
Filling
&amp; Simple
Even if you’re not a big spicy food lover, you’ll love this salad. Think more smokiness and depth of flavor rather than heat. Not to mention, the subtle sweetness of the dressingbrings balance so it’s not overwhelming.
This salad would be an excellent entree for a weeknight meal, or for hosting vegan orgluten free friends and family. It’s so heartyit stands on its own as a main dish! Buthummus and pita or naan would make excellent additions.

The chia seed hasbeenhaving amoment for what seems like the past five years. That’s probably because its uses arelimitless.


My favorite everyday way to use chia seedsis in place of flax seeds in a Flax Egg, Simple Fruit Compote, and Grain-Free Granola.
But upon discovering you could also use them to make creamy, dreamy pudding, I had to give it a go. Consider this recipe my whittled down, super simple version that’s naturally sweetened, vegan and gluten free. Anyone can make it! Plus, it’s so healthy it’s actually suitable for breakfast. If that doesn’t sell you, I don’t know what will (Rhonda).
Let’s get our pudding on, shall we?
This recipe is simple, requiring just 6 basic ingredients that are totally versatile.
This is the beauty of chia pudding. Once you have the chia seed-to-liquid ratio right, the flavor possibilities are endless.


I hope you LOVE this pudding. It’s:
Creamy
Seriously pudding-like
Naturally sweetened
Chocolaty
Loaded with nutrients
&amp; easy
Make this the night before for a decadent breakfast or mid-day snack. Or prep it in the morning for a hands-off, simple dessert to unwind from the day.
You can’t go wrong either way! And it lasts for a couple of days in the fridge –if you can resist sneaking spoonfuls that long.

","To a small mixing bowl add cacao powder (sift first to reduce clumps), maple syrup, ground cinnamon, salt, and vanilla and whisk to combine. Then add a little dairy-free milk at a time and whisk until a paste forms. Then add remaining dairy-free milk and whisk until smooth.Add chia seeds and whisk once more to combine. Then cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 3-5 hours (until it's achieved a pudding-like consistency).Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for 4-5 days, though best when fresh. Serve chilled with desired toppings, such as fruit, granola, or coconut whipped cream."
532,All-Natural Gin and Tonic | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"All-Natural Gin and Tonics

I’m becoming a gin and tonic girl. Is that OK, Mom?
There’s something mesmerizing about how light andbubbly this drink is. So refreshing and simple. I’m not even usually one for dry cocktails, and I’m certainly no gin connoisseur. But come springtime, gin and tonics are practically all I want in my hand.
OK, that and margaritas. Tequila, I’ll never quit you.

How is this recipe “all natural?” I’m glad you asked!
Most store bought tonic waters have weird, unnatural ingredientsand are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.
So lately, John and I have been making our own, all natural version bysweetening with maple syrup, agave or honey, and then relying onseltzer or sparkling water for the fizz. Works like a charm!
So fizzy, refreshing, and easy.


This version gets a tart-sweetness from sliced kumquat that’s been muddled with gin and sweetener. However, for first timers I would recommend trying this with lime (see notes) for a more traditional flavor!
I’m a sucker for colorful spring produce, hence this brightened-up orange version.

I think you guys are going to love this cocktail! It’s:
Refreshing
Fizzy
Light
Perfectly sweet
Slightly tart
&amp; Simple
This has been our go-to drink for at home happy hours (the best kind of happy hour in my opinion). I can’t wait to experiment with other infusions and flavors!
If you give our version a try, let us know! Leave a comment or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. It will be like a virtual cocktail party. Trust me, you wanna be there. Cheers, friends!

","Add kumquats, sweetener, and 1/2 ounce gin (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a serving glass and muddle to break down sweetener and release citrus juices. Add remaining gin and stir well to combine.If you’re not into citrus pulp/skin, scoop out or strain the kumquats from the drink. The whole fruit is edible though, so I left mine in! Otherwise, move onto the next step.Add ice and top off with sparkling water to achieve desired strength of drink. Add 2-3 ounces for a stronger drink and 3-5 ounces for a weaker drink (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Taste and adjust sweetness and strength as needed. Optional: Garnish with additional kumquat slices. Serve."

Allow me to introducemy absolute new favorite cake.
Chocolaty
Hazelnutty
Vegan
Gluten-Free

The obsession is real.

This recipe was inspired by my Best Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes, and my love for Nutella. I mean who doesn’t love Nutella? Even Rhonda loves Nutella. Get on board people.

And to keep things simple, it all comes together in 1 BOWL. Anyone can make this cake. No special mixers, methods, or equipment necessary.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and butter two 8"" round cake pans (or line 24 muffin tins with paper liners // as original recipe is written // adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Dust with gluten free flour and shake out excess.Measure out almond milk and add vinegar. Stir and let curdle while moving onto the next step.Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add baking soda to the almond milk vinegar mixture and stir.Add the sugar, maple syrup and almond milk mixture to the flax egg and beat/whisk to combine. Then add applesauce, vanilla, melted coconut oil, salt and mix.Add cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour and gluten free flour and beat/whisk to combine. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk, but it should be perfect. It should resemble a semi-thick batter that’s pourable.Divide batter evenly between cake pans (if using muffin tins, it should be enough for roughly 24 filling generously 3/4 full // amount as original recipe is written).Bake cake for 35-45 minutes or more (cupcakes for about 29-35 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top appears dry. Time will vary if you sub ingredients, as well as depending on the size of your pan.Let rest in the tin for 15-20 minutes, then carefully run a butter knife along the edges and invert onto cooling racks. Let cool completely.FOR FROSTING: Add almond milk to your rinsed out mixing bowl from earlier and microwave for 1 minute. (Alternatively, heat in a saucepan until just simmering and then transfer back to mixing bowl.)Immediately add chocolate to warm milk but don’t touch for 3 minutes so it can melt.Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate, then add coconut oil or softened butter and cover. Let rest untouched for another 10 minutes.Use your mixer (or a whisk) to beat the mixture together. Then add 1 cup powdered sugar, mix again, and place in fridge to set for 20 minutes. You’ll know it’s ready when you tip it and it’s slow to move.Remove from fridge and beat again. If it’s still too thin, add another 1/4 - 1/2 cup powdered sugar (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and beat until light and fluffy. I found that adding 1 3/4 cups total powdered sugar (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) was perfect. Set aside.Transfer the bottom layer of the cooled cake to a serving plate/dish. Spread a semi-generous layer of frosting on the top of the bottom layer and top generously with hazelnuts. Press down with hands to settle them into the frosting (see photo).Carefully top with second layer and frost the top generously, then the sides. Using a butter knife yields a smooth surface. It should be the perfect amount of frosting - not too thick, not too thin.Add hazelnuts around the perimeter of the top of the cake. Slice and serve.Will keep well-covered at room temperature for several days, though best when fresh. Refrigeration not necessary."

535,Easy Whole Wheat Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Easiest Whole Grain Seeded Bread

My mom used to make her own bread and yogurt from scratch.
I mean, come on. How cool is she?
I remember learning that and thinking my mom was the most awesome hippie mom ever and I wanted to do the same if I was ever a mama.
The bread-making season in our house ended sometime around the arrival of 10-pound me. But can you blame her? She had two babies to look after and who has time to make bread with so much life happening?
Well, the good news is, you do have time to make this bread. I even speculate you could make it with a baby on your hip because it is literally a dump, mix, rise and bake kind of bread! Let’s get to baking!

This recipe is simple in both preparation and ingredients.
Just 9 basic ingredients that are very forgiving. If you don’t have any of the seeds or oats on hand, just omit them! It’s still totally doable.
With a short 20-minute bake time, hands on prep time is only15 minutes + the rise! Hello, free time.
When I say dump, mix, rise, I mean it.
You literally dump theingredients in a bowl, mix and let it do its thing in the fridge.

All that’s left to do is knead in the seedy and oat-y things and let it rise once more while the oven preheats.
Twentyminutes later and you have a perfectly delicious, seedy, whole grain loaf on your hands.

This loafis magnificent; everything you want in a homemade bread. It’s:
Seriouslysimple
Tender on the inside
Crusty on the outside
Loadedwith whole grains
Seedy
Dreamy
&amp; Perfect
This makes the perfect breadfor toast, sandwiches, french toast, and everything in between.
I’ve been loving it with smashed avocado and a little vegan parmesan cheese and hemp seeds, or with peanut butter and flax seed. You really can’t go wrong.

","Combine warm water (like bath water, or 110 degrees F / 43 C), yeast, maple syrup or sugar, salt, flax seed and flours in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. If using a stand mixer, beat at medium speed for about a minute. Otherwise just use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands. Add flour until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides - about 3 3/4 cups total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature and 2 hours in the fridge. Alternatively, go straight for the fridge for two hours to save time, though a longer rise is best.Use fingers to create a small hole in the dough and pour in sunflower seeds and oats. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead about 20 turns or until elastic. Form into a loaf-like shape.Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet and sift a light coating of flour over the top to help keep the dough moist. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ½-inch deep.Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen.Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage."
536,Banh Mi Spring Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banh Mi Spring Rolls

Is it possible to make an adaption of a recipe that you’ve never actually tasted?
In my world, yes, yes it is.

I’ve wanted to make a simple, vegan version of Banh Mi – a Vietnamese baguette sandwich traditionally served with seasoned pork and pickled vegetables – for quite some time now. The problem is it’s not a simple recipe, nor is it vegan.I had some work to do.
On a recent car ride – often when many recipe ideas hit me unexpectedly – I thought spring rolls were the perfection solution. They’re easy, fast, and fresh, and are easy to keep both vegan and gluten-free. Yahtzee!


This recipe is simple with just 10 ingredients (give or take a garnish)! Prep and cook time is right around 45 minutes, as well, making this a great option for weeknight dinners.
For dipping sauce, you can either use the vinegar sauceused to quick pickle your veggies for a lighter option, or opt for a heartier sauce utilizing your favorite nut butter.
To keep everyone happy, I include three options below. You’re welcome.

These rolls are a veggie lover’s dream. They’re:
Fast
Fresh
Super crisp
Healthy
Satisfying
Hearty thanks tothe tofu
Tangy from the pickled vegetables
&amp; Seriously delicious

These would be a great make-ahead dish to take along for hikes, picnics and work lunches – all things I hope you get to enjoy this spring. Consider these rolls a big hug from us Minimalist Bakers to you.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top to press. Once preheated, slice tofu into medium-sized rectangles (see photo) and place on a parchment-lined (or lightly greased) baking sheet.Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Generously brush with soy sauce and set aside.While the tofu is baking, prepare pickling sauce by combining rice vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and lime juice in a jar and shaking to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more sweetener of choice for sweetness, or vinegar or lime juice for tanginess. Transfer to fridge to chill.Next, prep vegetables by julienning or thinly slicing radish, carrot and any other desired fillings (jalapeño is a common Banh Mi addition). Add to vinegar mixture to quick pickle in the fridge.Prepare station for making spring rolls by getting a surface to lay rice papers on, and heat 2-3 cups (amount as original recipe is written // increase as needed if making larger batch) water to boiling, then turn off heat.Drain pickled veggies at this time and reserve liquid for dipping. If opting for a nut butter sauce, prepare at this time (recipe links above).To prepare a spring roll, dip rice paper in hot water for 15-20 seconds, or until soft and pliable and transfer to a damp working surface (such as a cutting board). Then add 3-4 pieces tofu, pickled vegetables, 1-2 tsp sriracha or chili garlic sauce, and a large handful of cilantro. Fold over once, tuck in edges, and continue rolling over.Lay seam side down on a serving platter or baking sheet and cover with a slightly damp towel to keep moist. Continue until all spring roll fillings are used up - about 10-12 rolls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve with leftover vinegar sauce OR my favorite almond butter or peanut butter sauce (recipes above). Leftovers store well covered in the fridge for up to 2 days, though best when fresh."
537,Vegan Chocolate Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecakes

It’s about that time again. Cheesecake:30. Who’s in?

You guys know I have a thing for cheesecake, even though I’m dairy-free these days.
After my Traditional 7-Ingredient Cheesecake recipe was such a roaring success, I dabbled with thePeanut Butter Cupvariety.
And now, all chocolate. Because, well, chocolate is always the answer.
This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes prep and10 basic ingredients you likely have on hand right this moment:
Dates
Nuts (walnuts + cashews)
Cocoa (or cacao) powder
Dairy-free chocolate
Olive oil
Maple syrup
Sea salt
Lemon juice
Coconut milk
If not, go to the store real quick. I’ll wait…

The filling is where the magic is at.
Soaked cashews provide a creamy neutral base.
Lemon juice a subtle tang.
Coconut milk silky smooth texture (without affecting the flavor)
Olive oil richness.
Maple syrup sweetness.
And dairy-free dark chocolate a deep chocolate flavor. Not to mention, it helps the cheesecakes firm up in the fridge, making this recipe NOfreeze andNObake!

Once set, these gems pop right out of their ramekins (or muffin tin or cake pan – see notes for options!) and are so thick and firm it’s like custard!
Your mouth won’t believe these are dairy free. Get ready to stump your friends and family in the best way possible.

All that’s left is toppings!
I went with coconut whipped cream, fresh berries, and a dusting of cacao powder. But I include other ideas below, including a recipe for a quick peanut butter sauce!

I think you guys are going to LOVE these cheesecakes. They’re:
Creamy
Custardy
Chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Insanelyrich
&amp; Seriously simple
Make these for a crowd or just for yourself. They store well in the fridge for a few days, and in the freezer for up to a few weeks! The great news is, unlike my other flavors, these stay firm at room temperature for hours, so if you’re taking this one to a party, you’re good to go!

","Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Next add nuts, salt and cocoa powder and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal.Cut out parchment paper into circles the shape of your ramekins, muffin tins or pan (see notes for size options). In addition, to make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut out two strips of parchment paper per ramekin and lay them in an ""X"" shape at the base. Top with circle shape. This creates little tabs that make removing the cheesecakes easier to pop out once set.Divide crust among serving dishes and carefully press with fingers to distribute. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to and really press it down, allowing some crust to come up the sides. If it sticks, separate the crust and glass with a small piece of parchment paper. Set in fridge or freezer to firm up.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth - up to 2-3 minutes. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice, maple syrup/agave or a splash more coconut milk as the liquid should help it blend better.Scrape down sides as needed and blend until very creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness as needed.Divide filling evenly among the ramekins (or other serving dish). Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set - about 4-6 hours depending on size of dish. Expedite this process by popping them into the freezer for 1-2 hours.Once set, run a butter knife along the edge and gently remove by tugging on the tabs in an upward motion. They should pop right out. If they aren't quite set, pop them in the freezer for 15-20 minutes and they should come out easily.Top with a touch of coconut whipped cream and fresh berries, or as is!

This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and 15 minutes.
To achieve that Mayan spice profile, I went forground cinnamon for warmth, nutmeg for a slight nuttiness, and cayenne for heat. A pinch of salt balances the sweetness of the dark chocolate, and coconut whipped cream sends things over the top. Swoon.

What to make for dinner. Isn’t that the struggle?
Well struggle no more, friends, because 10-ingredient Vegan Lasagna Eggplant Roll-Ups are here (and they’re crazy delicious)!

This recipe is inspired by my all-time favorite Italian dish – Lasagna!
Have you ever contemplated what your “last meal” would be if you had to choose? It’s a tough call for me, being that I love all food. But forced to decide, I think lasagna would rise to the top of the list. It’s classy soul foodstuffed withfresh herbs and robust flavor.

This version starts with a tofu “ricotta” filling that’s comprised of simple ingredients, such as:
Tofu
Lemon Juice
Nutritional Yeast
Fresh Basil + Dried Oregano
Olive Oil
Salt + Pepper
Vegan Parmesan Cheese (aka fairy dust)
This creamy combo comes together quick (5 minutes!) and adds some serious staying powerto these rolls – 6 grams protein per serving!

Look at that goodness. I want to put it on everything, STAT.

Instead of traditional lasagna noodlesI opted for thinly sliced eggplant to add more veggie power and keep these babes gluten free!
To help themachieve a slightly roasted flavor and soft texture,Isimply par-baked them for 15 minutes. Then all that’s left to do is add the fillingfor one seriously delicious and healthymeal.

All in all this dish requires10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour start to finish! That’s my kind of dinner.
I think you’re going to love these rolls. They’re:
Incredibly filling
Veggie-packed
Protein-rich
Savory
Comforting
&amp; Simply delicious
Thiswould make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something a little extraspecial. It wouldalso be great for impressing guests, especially a vegan / gluten free crowd. Bonus? They reheat well the next day for leftovers (hello, lunch upgrade).

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C).Salt eggplant slices on both sides and arrange in a colander in the sink to remove excess water/bitterness for 15 minutes. (If using lasagna noodles, boil, drain and set aside.)Rinse salted eggplant slices well and dry thoroughly between two clean absorbent towels. Lay a baking sheet on top and place something heavy on top to absorb excess moisture.Arrange slices on 1-2 baking sheets in an even layer and bake oven for 13-15 minutes. Set aside and reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).While eggplant is baking, add all tofu filling ingredients to a food process or blender and pulse to combine, scraping down sides as needed. You are looking for a semi-pureed mixture with bits of basil still intact. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and lemon juice for brightness.Pour about 1/2-1/3 of the marinara sauce into an 8x8 baking dish (or similar sized dish) and reserve rest of sauce for topping / serving. Set aside.Scoop generous amounts (about 3 Tbsp) of ricotta filling onto each eggplant slice or lasagna noodle and roll up. Place seam side down in the sauce-lined baking dish. Continue until all filling and noodles or eggplant strips are used up. Pour more sauce down the center of the rolls for extra flavor (see photo).Bake for 15-23 minutes, or until sauce is bubbly and warm and the top of the rolls are very slightly browned.Serve immediately with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh basil. Leftovers keep for a couple of days, though best when fresh."
540,BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches with Avocado Slaw

I know what you’re thinking.
What the whois that?
It’s BBQ jackfruit – aka the ticketto reclaiming your favorite BBQ sandwich.
Hubba. Hubba.

This recipe was inspired by the talented folks at FuD– a vegan eatery in Kansas City.
When we were still Midwest dwellers I had the chanceto eat at FuD several times and was most drawn to their faux meat dishes usingjackfruit.
I’d seen jackfruit in Asian stores before and just thought it looked like a giant green eyesore (because that’s what it is). However, I had no idea that its texture lends itself to mocking meat and absorbing just about any flavor you throw its way.
In other words, it’s a vegan’s dream food.

This recipe is simple, requiring just10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and 30 minutes!
The only ingredient this recipe requires that’s likely not lying around your pantry is green jackfruit, which can be found at practically any Asian market and onAmazon.
NOTE: Just be sure it’s young green jackfruit in water, not brineor syrup. This is key to achieving proper flavor and texture.

The process is so simple.
Drain and clean jackfruit.
Toss with BBQ spices.
Saute.
Add BBQ sauce.
Simmer.
Voila!
BBQ jackfruit in just 30 minutes that will fool any carnivoreinto thinking they’re eating pulled pork. This stuff is legit.

To add more flavor and texture to the mix, I include a quick avocado veggie slaw that’s easily prepared while thejackfruit is simmering.
And for even morehealthy fats and some protein, roasted salted cashews – because who doesn’t want a giant handful of cashews on anything they’re eating? (Shush, Rhonda – just shush.)
This BBQ jackfruit sandwich is legit! It’s:
Smoky
Hearty
Tender
Big in BBQ flavor
Crunchy from the slaw
Satisfying
&amp; Simple
Even the novice can make this sandwich. All that’s left to do is sit back and watch your friends marvel at what they’re eating. I’ll never scorn the jackfruit again, no matter now ugly and weird it is.

If you try this sandwich, let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

","Rinse, drain, and thoroughly dry jackfruit. Chop off the center ""core"" portion of the fruit and discard. Place in a mixing bowl and set aside.Mix together BBQ seasoning and add to jackfruit. Toss to coat.Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp oil of choice and seasoned jackfruit (use more oil, as needed, if increasing batch size). Toss to coat and cook for 2-3 minutes to achieve some color.Add BBQ sauce and thin with enough water to make a sauce. Stir and reduce heat to low- medium and cook for about 20 minutes (up to 35 minutes on low for a deeper flavor).Remove lid and stir occasionally. TIP: For finer texture, use two forks to shred the jackfruit as it cooks down.In the meantime, make slaw by adding all ingredients except vegetables (avocado through salt + pepper) to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Thin with water until a thick sauce is made, then add veggies and toss to coat. Set in the refrigerator until serving.Once the jackfruit has been properly simmered, turn up heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 more minutes to get a little extra color/texture (a tip I learned from Namely Marly!). Then remove from heat.Place generous portions of slaw on the bottom buns, top with generous serving of BBQ jackfruit, and cashews. Serve with extra BBQ sauce!Leftover jackfruit keeps for up to a couple days in the fridge, though best when fresh."
541,Easy Raw Vegan Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Vegan Brownies with Chocolate Ganache

As of March 13,John and I have been married five years. We did it!
To celebrate I’m sharing 20 random facts about us that you may or may not know. Here goes.

John hates the smell of brownies baking (hence thisno bake recipe). He literally vacatesthe house when I’m baking anything reminiscent of them.
I love sweets; he could care less.
We both grew up in Kansas.
We dated fourmonths before getting engaged.
We honeymooned in Breckenridge, Colorado, but didn’t ski once. (We ate our way through townand napped all day – it was perfect.)
We were opposites growing up – he was into computers and I was into sports and my hair.
We’ve lived in three states and moved 10 times in our five years of marriage!
We both think Portland, Oregon, is the greatest city on Earth (where we currently reside and intend to stay forev-ah).
Between the two of us, we’ve visited 14 countries since getting hitched.
We don’t have kids but are expert succulent caretakers.
I’m 2 years older than John. He’ll be 27 this year and I’ll be 29 (cougar alert).
We’re lovers ofgood wine and coffee.
I have one older sister, John is the oldest ofsix!
Before Minimalist Baker I hadmany jobs, includingweb writer, barista, house cleaner, and waitress at approximately 100,000 restaurants.
John went to law school and hated it. So I put him to work on Minimalist Baker (wink, wink).
We desperately want to visit Iceland, Ireland, and pretty much every other country we haven’t been to yet.
We have a Sunday tradition of eatingpizza and watching Saturday Night Live.
John is a voracious reader. I can hardly sit down long enough to write a grocery list.
While I write the content and take the photographs for the blog, John does literally everything else. We make a good pair.
I think he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.


﻿
Now that you’ve takena virtual tour of our relationship, onto dessert! You deserve it.
These brownies are entirely raw (except for the frosting) and superfudgy and rich. They come together in about 20 minutesand require simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now – such as,
Walnuts
Almonds
Dates
Cacao (or cocoa)Powder + Nibs
Sea Salt

And the ganache? Oh man.
It’s butter-free and utilizes coconut oil for an extra creamy finish.
While your brownies are chilling, whip this up in about 15 minutes and you’re good to go!
Spread it on thick, friends.This isn’t the time to skimp.
These gemsare everything you want in a brownie. They’re:
Rich
Dense
Superfudgy
Studded with walnuts (and cacao nibs) for crunch
Incredibly satisfying
Simple to make
&amp; Highly shareable

One bite in and I was done for.
Hence the reason I shuffled downstairs and handed these off to our apartment manager. Brownies of any form are too tempting to have around the house.
Not to worry, though. I managed to consume three before giving them away. OK, maybe four…
John had none, obviously.

","Place 1 cup walnuts (as original recipe is written // use 2/3 of the total if altering batch size) and the almonds in food processor and process until finely ground.Add the cacao powder and sea salt and pulse to combine. Transfer to bowl and set aside.Add the dates to the food processor and process until small bits remain. Remove and set aside.Add nut and cocoa mixture back into food processor and while processing, drop small handfuls of the date pieces down into the food processor or blender spout.Process until a dough consistency is achieved, adding more dates if the mixture does not hold together when squeezed in your hand. You may not use all the dates.Add the brownie mixture to a small parchment lined 8x8 dish (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and before pressing, add remaining 1/2 cup roughly chopped walnuts (as original recipe is written // use remaining 1/3 of walnuts if altering batch size) and cacao nibs and toss to combine and evenly distribute. Then press down with hands until it is flat and firm. I like laying down a piece of plastic wrap to prevent sticking and get it really flat.Lift parchment paper to remove brownies from dish and use hands to slightly squeeze in the sides to create a smaller square - this will make the brownies slightly thicker and more dense.Transfer back to dish and place in freezer or fridge to chill for 10-15 minutes before cutting into 12 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) even squares (If adding ganache, slice afterwards!).FOR THE GANACHE: Add almond milk to a mixing bowl and microwave for 45 seconds or until very warm. Alternatively, heat in a small saucepan until just simmering, then transfer to mixing bowl.Immediately add chocolate to warm milk and loosely cover. Don’t touch for 2 minutes so it can melt.Add salt and stir gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate, then add melted coconut oil and use a whisk to mix. Set in fridge for 10 minutes to thicken.Remove from fridge and add powdered sugar a little at a time to thicken. Whisk again to combine. If it’s still too thin, add another few Tablespoons powdered sugar and beat until light and fluffy.Frost brownies generously with frosting and then top with additional raw walnuts and cacao nibs (optional). Slice into 12 even squares (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Store brownies in an airtight container to keep fresh. Will keep for 3-4 days at room temperature, or in the freezer for at least 1 month (though best when fresh)."
542,Roasted Jalapeno Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Jalapeño Hummus

Are you guys ready for something spicy?
Something healthy andsavory and delicious?
Good, I have just the thing.
Let’s make Jalapeño Hummus, yo!

This hummus is inspired by all things yellow and green. Also, by my love ofspicy food.
My dad raised me right on jalapeños and black pepper blanketingeverything. Literally, a blanket of pepper.
Thankfully, I’ve also persuaded John to jump on the spice train. At this point it’s an all out competitionto see who can win the spice off war. Somehow, John’s winning. Hopefully this hummus puts me back in the lead.

This recipe requires about10 ingredients and 30 minutes start to finish.
It beginswith roasted jalapeños and garlic cloves. Then,simply add all your other basic hummus ingredients like lemon (and lime!), salt, pepper, tahini and a few additional spices and you’re in hummus heaven!
I even threw in half an avocado for even more creaminess and nutrients.Tasty nutrients for the win.


This humus is my new go-to! It’s:
Super creamy
Savory
Spicy
Mega healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Seriously delicious
An optional step is to roast up some pumpkin seeds with cumin and sea salt for an extra crunchy bite. This also makes you look super fancy, so it’s kind of a win-win.

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C).Place garlic cloves with skin still on and whole jalapeños on a baking sheet. Drizzle garlic cloves with a small amount of oil of choice (avocado or olive are best) and roast for 15-18 minutes, flipping jalapeños once to ensure even roasting. If the garlic cloves get too roasty-looking, take them out.Once done, remove from oven and set garlic aside.Wrap jalapeños in foil to steam for a few minutes. Then carefully peel away skin and remove seeds. Be sure to wash your hands afterwards!To a blender or food processor, add slightly drained chickpeas, oil, cilantro, avocado, salt, cumin, lime, lemon, roasted jalapeños (start with one and work your way up to desired spice level), tahini and peeled garlic cloves (you should be able to peel away the skin or just squeeze the garlic out).Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. (I used two medium jalapeños and it was plenty spicy // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).To prepare toasted pumpkin seeds, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and toss pumpkin seeds in 1 Tbsp oil + a pinch each salt, pepper and cumin (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 8-12 minutes. Add to top of hummus, along with another drizzle of olive oil (optional) and fresh cilantro.Serve hummus with veggies, tortilla chips or pita. Leftovers keep well in the fridge, covered for up to 1 week, though best when fresh."
543,Creamy Asparagus Pea Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Asparagus and Pea Soup

Chances are it’s still a little chilly out where you live as spring creeps on, but there is already ample opportunity to take advantage ofspring produce.
Bring on the asparagus and peas and all things green, I say! Also, let’s make soup, shall we?

This simple spring soup includes two of my all time favorite vegetables: asparagus and peas!
Sautéed garlic and shallot add depth of flavor while almond milk makes it oh so creamy. Two optional finishing touches? Nutritional yeast fora cheesy, garlickypunch, andlemon juice for a bright finish.

I could just drink this soup it’s so green and gorgeous.
You can enjoy it as is, but any creamy soup calls for a garnish, am I right? Five-ingredient garlic herb croutons to the rescue! You can whip these gems up while your soup’s simmering away. And in my opinion, they totally make it.

This soup screams spring! It’s
Creamy
Garlicky
Savory
Comforting
Super green
Packedwith veggies
Nutrient-rich
&amp; quick! Just 30 minutes required start to finish
No soup should require more than a handful of ingredients, in my humble opinion. And this one fits the bill with 9basic ingredients. Garlic croutons are optional, but let’s be real– I eat the soup for the croutons. #addicted

Friends, if you make this soup, let us know! Leave a comment or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and shallot and garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper and stir to coat. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until fragrant and translucent. Reduce heat if garlic begins browning.Add peas, vegetable broth and almond milk and season with salt and pepper once more.Transfer soup to blender along with asparagus (reserve some for garnish if desired). Blend soup until creamy and smooth. Transfer back to pot and bring to medium heat and simmer.Add nutritional yeast and whisk. Continue cooking until warmed through and simmering, then reduce heat to low.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper if desired. Remove from heat and add lemon juice.If serving with croutons, prep while soup is simmering by lowering oven heat to 325 degrees F.Add bread crumbs to a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together oil and seasonings and pour over bread crumbs and toss to combine. Season once more with a bit more garlic powder, salt and pepper. Toss once more.Spread on a clean baking sheet (or the one you used earlier) and bake or 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Flip/stir at the 10-minute mark to ensure even baking.Serve soup with croutons, a touch of black pepper, and/or vegan parmesan cheese. Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh."

Let’s cut to the chase.
You’re cold.
Andthirsty.
You like bourbon (yes, even you Rhonda).
It’s been a long day.
You needadrink.
I have just the thing.

John and I havegotten really into hot toddies this winter even though it’s been a mild one here in the Northwest. We’ve been mixing updifferent variations, always including bourbon.Hot toddies and bourbon go together like PB&amp;J – trust me.
This version is special because it starts with a homemade simple syrup that’s naturally sweetened with maple syrup. It gets its flavor with an infusionof both cinnamon and chilies.
It’s subtly spicy and warm and altogether lovely. Keep it on hand for other winter cocktails that could use a spicy-sweetkick!


It’s toddy time! Start with half a lemon. Then add your simple syrup.

Next? A generous pour of bourbon. Oh mama.

Hot water to top. Then garnish with a lemon wedge and cinnamon stick and it’s party time.

This is the perfect cocktail for chilly evenings. It’s
Warm
Subtly spiced
Perfectly sweet
Slightly tart
&amp; super boozy
What more could you ask for in a cocktail?

","Add maple syrup, water, cinnamon sticks, chili, and red pepper flakes to a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Then remove from heat and let steep for 30 minutes - 1 hour (or longer). Strain and pour into a glass jar for serving.To make a single toddy, add the juice of half a lemon, 3-4 Tbsp Chili Cinnamon Maple Simple Syrup, 2 ounces bourbon, and hot water to top (use less water for a stronger drink, more water for a weaker drink).Garnish with another cinnamon stick and lemon slice or wedge and serve. The longer it steeps the stronger the cinnamon, lemon flavor becomes.Repeat for more drinks or make a large batch to serve a crowd by simply multiplying ingredients by number of drinks you need."

The ice cream Snickers of your youth is now fully within reach.
Five ingredients.
Vegan.
Naturally sweetened.
And it tastes like Ryan Gosling looks.
Friends, let’s do this.

This dream dessert truly is made with just 5 ingredients (I KNOW), starting with my Sea Salt Caramel Coconut Ice Creamas the base.
The good news is, any neutral-flavored vanilla or caramel-like vegan ice cream will do. I even think coffeeor chocolate would be lovely here! Dream big, friends. Dream big.

Raw dates comprise the caramel (which is kind of magic because it doesn’t fully freeze in the freezer! I know.)
Salted peanuts come next because what would a Snickers be without the peanuts? So much salty crunch.
Lastly, a dark chocolate shell.
How could you go wrong?

You guys are going to LOVE these bars. They’re:
Creamy
Rich
Caramel-y
Peanutty
Crunchy
Chocolaty
&amp; Frozen dessert perfection
This homemade version is shockingly close to the original, even with the 1-ingredient caramel! Trust me – I know. I ate like one every day in high school.
Get ready to fool your friends into thinking you’re a dessert wizard (because you totally are).

Set back in freezer.Melt chocolate and coconut oil over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Set aside.Remove bars from freezer once set and use a spoon to drizzle the tops generously with chocolate. Work quickly, then set back in the freezer to harden - about 30 minutes.Transfer remaining chocolate to a shallow bowl or plate and reheat in microwave if it's gotten too firm.Once firm, remove bars from freezer once more and dip the bottoms in the remaining chocolate and brush away extra with the back of a spoon or spatula. Set back on parchment to freeze once more.Serve directly from freezer as they become soft when they set out. Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple weeks, though best when fresh."
546,Mexican Quinoa Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Quinoa Salad with Orange Lime Dressing

Anytime we return home from traveling, I crave big leafysalads and all of the green smoothies.
My bodymisses the 24-hour veggie stream it usually receives when I’m home and in control of my diet. So when we got back from our respective trips last week, the first thing I added toour meal plan was a big Mexican salad.
So healthy, filling, and fresh – just what we both needed.

We have a pretty standard taco salad we like to eat that includes black beans, guacamole, greens, tomato, onion, lime juice and salsa. But sometimes it’s good to switch things up.
This 30-minute salad starts with a bed of leafy greens and is topped with super foods like quinoa, black beans, and avocado. Orange segments and corn add brightness and a subtle sweetness, anda creamyorange-lime avocadodressing ties it all together.

This dressing was originally goingto be a vinaigrette, but I couldn’t resist throwing the other half of my avocado in the mix for super creamy texture.
Orange juice adds a citrusy sweetness, lime juice adds a tart bite, and chili and cumin add a smoky heat that balances everything out. In other words, it’s borderline dressing perfection.


I’m seriously smitten with this salad. It’s:
Fresh
Filling
Super Healthy
Loaded with super foods, protein, +fiber
Flavorful
Simple
&amp; Fast
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something quick and healthy. Bonus? I think this would please vegans and non-vegans alike, andleftovers make a great lunch for the next day.
Although it’s delicious as is, I would highly recommend crushing up sometortilla chips and putting them on top for extra crunch. I mean, come on – live a little.
We hope you love this salad! If you give it a try, take a picture and tag it#minimalistbaker on Instagram or Twitter! We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

","Begin preparing quinoa first by thoroughly rinsing 1/2 cup quinoa  in a fine mesh strainer then bringing to a boil with 1 cup water in a small saucepan (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size // use a 1:2 ratio dry quinoa to water). Once boiling, reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook on low for 15-20 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare salad ingredients by chopping vegetables, segmenting orange, and warming black beans and seasoning with salt, cumin, chili and garlic powder.Prepare dressing by adding all ingredients to a blender or food processor and blending until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more hot sauce, orange juice and salt. TIP: if you prefer a vinaigrette, leave out the avocado and simply whisk all ingredients together in a bowl. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Either plate salad and serve with dressing on the side, or toss with dressing before serving. Pairs well with salsa, fresh lime juice and tortilla chips.Leftovers keep for up to a few days, though best when fresh."
547,Salted Caramel Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sea Salt Caramel Coconut Ice Cream

I know. It’s still technically winter, you guys. But in the Northwest, it’s practically spring! There are literally trees blooming outside our window. I could faint from excitement.
Plus, you know how I feel about dessert.Thus the reason we must ice cream.
Yes, ice cream is now a verb. Get on board.

This ice cream was inspired by the best vegan ice cream on the planet, which happens to be scooped up right here in Portland at Salt and Straw.
If you’re ever in the area, you must try theircoconut caramel ice cream with chocolate candy chunks. It’s what veganice cream dreams are made of.

The best part about this recipe? Itrequiresonly7 ingredients,and it’snaturally sweetened!
I opted to forgo the chocolate candy bar pieces because I’m a purist (or lazy). But in my opinion, it’s so close to the original that if blindfolded I may notbe able to tell the difference between theirversion and mine. I think this is love.

I was half tempted to try a sugar-based vegan caramel sauce, but I realized my sea salt date caramel wasavery good thing.Date caramel isentirely natural, quick, easy, and requires just 2 ingredients. TWO.
Add bourbon at your own discretion. But c’mon. A little won’t hurt.

This ice cream is delicious like WHOA. It’s:
Creamy
Luxurious
Perfectly sweet
Salted caramel-infused
Rich
Satisfying
SIMPLE
&amp; Seriously amazing
I have another recipe coming soon that utilizes this ice cream to recreate one of my favorite desserts of all time. Any guesses? I gave you guys a sneak peek on Instagram a couple weeks ago and can’t wait to share! Sit tight to see what I came up with. It’s gonna blow your dessert-loving mind.

","The night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill. Also, make sure you soak your cashews overnight OR the next day for at least 6 hours. Be sure to drain before adding to blender.Add soaked, drained cashews, coconut milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla and sea salt to a high speed blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Use the “liquify” setting if you have it. You want it to be completely creamy and blended.TIP: For best texture, chill mixture for at least 4-6 hours or preferably overnight. If you're in a rush, pop it in the freezer for 1-2 hours before adding to ice cream maker. Otherwise, proceed without chilling - it will just take longer to churn and may require extra chilling (see next step).Add chilled mixture to ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve. If it wasn't chill enough, it may not firm up during the churning process. In that case, pop it back in the freezer (still in the churning bowl) and freeze until mostly firm. Then churn once more.In the meantime, prepare caramel by adding dates to a food processor or blender and blending until creamy and smooth, adding warm water to encourage it along if it needs extra help. Season with sea salt (and bourbon if desired) and blend once more to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed. Set aside.Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a large freezer-safe container and spoon in desired amount of caramel (I used it all, but you can reserve it for other uses) and use a spoon or knife to swirl. Add a pinch more salt for even more salty-sweet contrast if desired.Smooth top and cover well. Freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm.Set out for 10-15 minutes before serving to soften. Will keep for up to 1 week, though best when fresh."
548,Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Aioli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Garlic Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Aioli

There are so many amazing restaurants in Portland. Living here is a foodie’s dream.
We recently triedLardo (a food cart turned restaurant), which has become quite famous for its coma-inducing sandwiches. However, after sampling a few items all I could think about was recreating their crispy fried Brussels sprouts.

They’re perfectly tender with a crisp bite,and are tossedin a creamy, bright-orange “mustard”sauce that’s amazing. It’s quite possibly what dreams are made of.
For the sauce I went for spicy with loads of Sriracha. I alsothink these would also be amazing with a creamy sweet “honey mustard” sauce, which you can adapt from this dressing recipe if you’d rather. Either way, the sprouts are where it’s at.

I’m calling these sprouts “Faux Fried” because they’re flash “fried” or sautéed in a very hot skillet to give them that crispy outer edge and tender center.
The beauty of this over roasting?No preheating required, and the whole recipe comes together in about 20 minutes, start to finish. Also? Just 10 ingredients including the sauce.


I’m absolutely smitten with these guys. They’re
Savory
Crisp
Tender on the inside
Garlicky
Dunked in creamy sriracha aioli
&amp; Seriously dreamy
These would make the perfect healthierappetizer or side dish for any weeknight meal, or to bust out when you want to impress friends.
I made a big batch and enjoyed leftovers reheated for lunch and alongside breakfast! The dipping sauce is certainly optional, but in my opinion, the sauce takes them to the next level.

","Preheat a large skillet to medium high heat and cut any larger Brussels sprouts in half.Add to a mixing bowl and toss with a generous amount of oil and season generously with salt.Once the pan is hot, add a bit more oil to the pan and only as many sprouts as will fit without crowding the pan.Cover and cook for 1 minute, then use tongs to toss and turn over halved sprouts to cook both sides evenly. Cover once more and cook for another 1-2 minutes.Shake the pan once more to toss the sprouts and then cover for another 30 seconds.Remove from heat and immediately add back to the (empty) mixing bowl. Top with minced garlic and season again with salt. Continue cooking other batches until all of the sprouts are sautéed.To serve, sprinkle with vegan parmesan cheese, herbs of choice, and serve with Sriracha aioli or preferred dipping sauce. These would also be delicious with a honey mustard sauce like this one (just leave it thicker for dipping).Leftovers keep well in the fridge for a few days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a skillet or (gasp) the microwave."

Well, you’ve gotta open with something? Why not Gina? (Don’t worry, Rhonda. You’re still my main ongoing-joke squeeze.)
I’m a huge muffin fan (yes, in both size, quantity, and frequency of consumption).
Did you know pretty much all of the muffin recipes on this blog are a spin-off of the muffins John used to bake me when we were dating? Yes, my man wooed me with muffins, hence the reason our courtship went so smoothly.

I’ve been eyeing the berries at the store for a while now, and when they had a special on blackberries, I couldn’t resist. The thing about blackberries in muffins is they’re so big they make these big juicy pockets in your muffin, so I opted to use a mix of smaller berries as well. But you could really use whatever berries you have on hand – that’s the beauty of it all.

These muffins are not only customizable and delicious, they’re also simple!
Just 1 bowl and basic ingredientsand methods required. And if you’re not a gluten-free eater, simplysub the GF flour blend for whole-wheat pastry or even spelt!

I’m kind of smitten with these guys (so much so I lit’rally couldn’t stop eating them). They’re:
Tender
Moist
Perfectly sweet
Loaded with berries
Coconut flaked
Wholesome

550,Vegan Cornbread for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cornbread For 2

Sometimes, you just need a thick slice of cornbread.
Not too much – not a whole pan.
Just enough to enjoy alongsideyour favorite soup or chili.
This, my friends, is that cornbread. Vegan cornbread for two!


I was very much raised in a cornbread-loving family. My mom made cornbread all the time, especially with chili, and we always had it with butter and maple syrup. Does it get more American than that?
Not much has changed. I still enjoy a hearty bowl of chili witha fat slice of cornbread smothered in the good stuff.Crumbly, sweet, a little sticky from the maple syrup. That’s what dreams are made of.
The problem is, I don’t like making a whole pan because someone in this house (hand raised) will eat thewhole pan.
Solution? Carve it down to just two servings perfect for John and me to enjoy on chili night.
Also? Vegan. Also? 10 ingredients. Also? EASY. Party on.

Now, this cornbread is not health food. I’ve tried to make cornbread healthy and it comes out tastinglike tar. Nope.
Cornbread should be crumbly.
It should be sweet.
It should be buttery.
It should make your mother proud.
This is that cornbread.
I’m happy to report that this cornbread is the one of my dreams. It’s:
Perfect
Crumbly
Tender
Moist with crisp edges
Sweet
Buttery

That's what you're going for.Divide batter between greased ramekins or muffin tins (it may take up to three muffin tins, but my ramekins were large enough to fit just 2 // as original recipe is written // adjust as needed if altering batch size).Bake for 28-35 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into a center comes out clean.Let rest in the cooking dish for a few minutes before serving. I highly recommend serving these with just a touch of non-dairy butter and maple syrup or honey if not vegan.Will keep in an airtight container for up to a couple days. Store in the freezer to keep longer. These would go excellent with my 5 ingredient Sweet Potato Black Bean Chili."
551,5-Ingredient Black Bean Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Sweet Potato Black Bean Chili

Are you surviving winter? Are your chilled to your bones?
Sometimes the only fix is some hot tea and a giant bowl of soup. Trust me, I know.
May I suggest warming up with this5-ingredient sweet potato black bean chili?
I think it’s just what we allneed.

For as much soup and chili as I eat, I have no idea why I don’t have more chili recipes on the blog! This had to change. Enter: Sweet potatoes and black beans married together in a hearty, savory-sweet chili.
The ingredients are things you likely have on hand right now.
Onion
Black Beans
Sweet Potato
Veggie Stock
Salsa
That’s it! Just 5.
I’ve also included a fewoptional spices to amp up the flavor, as well as a few topping ideas if you’re into that (hand raised, very high). In a pinch this is the perfect, healthy weeknight meal or make-ahead dish totake for lunches throughout the week.
You all know I have a thing for sweet potatoes and black beans together, and this soup marries them perfectly. It’s:
Savory
Naturally sweet
Slightly smoky
Soul warming
Satisfying
Healthy
&amp; Quick!
I made a batch and then froze several servings in mason jars to reheat throughout the week when I’m feeling particularly lazy (or cold). My favorite toppings include hot sauce, red onion, avocado and a few tortilla chips. Who am I kidding? Allof the chips.

I hope you guys love this simple chili! If you try it, let us know in the comments or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see. Cheers!
","In a large pot over medium heat, sweat onions in 1 Tbsp oil and season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // use more or less if altering batch size). Stir and continue cooking on medium heat until translucent and soft.Add sweet potato and any desired spices at this time (I went for chili, cinnamon, cumin, and chipotle powder - all are optional). Cook for 3 minutes. Then add salsa, water, and vegetable stock.Bring mixture to a low boil on medium high heat and then lower heat to medium-low and simmer. Add black beans, cover and cook for at least 20 minutes more, preferably 30 - or until the sweet potatoes are fork tender and the soup and thickened. This soup is at its best when prepared the night before or allowed to rest for a few hours so the flavor marries with the vegetables and beans.Serve with fresh cilantro, onion, avocado, and/or lime juice. Chips make an excellent spoon."
552,Kale Salad with Beets and Lentils | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Kale, Lentil, &amp; Roasted Beet Salad

When we got back from Mexico last week I decided to swear offcoffee, alcohol, dessert and fried foods for a week in the name of health.
Well, that backfired in the way of a massive caffeine headache, minor flu, and my body being all like “why you think you can take away everything we love at once? Not happening.”
Not happening indeed.
That little cleanse lasted about 3 daysbefore I was like “give me all the coffee and wine and tortilla chips. Muahahahaha.”

Even thoughthings are back to “normal” these daysand I have all of my loves back in my life,I’m still craving lotsa whole foods. There’s nothing like a vacation filled with overindulgence to send you running back into the arms of your beloved salad.
Me: “I’m so sorry I ever left you. Please, please, please take me back.”
Salad: “OK, fine.”

This salad is everything good about winter all rolled into one.
Hearty greens
Leeks
Beets
Lentils
Nuts
&amp; a tangy lemon-tahini dressing to marry it all together.
Friends, I think I’m in love. With a salad. (Don’t tell John.)

What’s this salad like? A big hug from winter.It’s
Hearty
Crisp
Savory, sweet, + tangy

553,Dulce de Leche Popsicles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Dulce de Leche Pops

Happy Valentine’s Day, friends! What are you up to this weekend?
I’m justgetting over a little cold and looking forward to a weekend in before we travel yet again all of next week.
This time I’ll be in Kansas visiting friends and family and tackling a freelance gig while John skips over to New Zealand with aclose friend. Lots of adventure inFebruary for us Minimalist Bakers.
Let’s get to the good stuff: dessert. If you’re in need of a last minute treatthis weekend, try these simple, naturally-sweetened Dulce de Leche Pops made with just 5 ingredients. (Bourbon is optional, but c’mon).

It all starts with the magic of coconut cream (or milk) and sultry dates.
I could eat dates all day every day – OK, I pretty much do. They work some serious magic in this recipe, providing a caramel swirl that’s seriously reminiscent of dulce de leche.
The process is simple, too. Just blend your dates into a smooth “caramel,” add half to the coconut milk, and mix. Then add the remaining date caramel back into the mix,swirl, and freeze! It’s that easy.
The result is a seriously delectable, naturally-sweetened vegan and gluten-free Popsicle that’s like ice cream on a stick. You’ll likely wantto eat all of them at once – trust me. This is why you need a friend on standby for help (in both restraint and sampling).

What do they taste like? So glad you asked. They’re:
Creamy
Smooth
Sweet
Caramel-swirled
Slightly salty
&amp; Soooo dreamy
These would make a delicious dessert any time of year, but especially when you want something creamy without breakingout the ice cream maker.
If you don’t have Popsicle molds, use oversized ice cube moldsinstead! It makes a fun shape and they can beeasilyblended into a milkshake with additional coconut milk (and/or bourbon – c’mon). Live a little – that’s what I say.

We hope you love this recipe! If you try it, let us know: Leave a comment, rate it, or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I also joinedthe Snapchat revolution (all the kids are doin’ it), so you can send me a pic there as well (username: minimalistbaker). I’m a super newbie though sobare with me.
Happy Valentine’s weekend, friends! We’re sending you all a giant John + Dana sandwich-style hug (even you, Rhonda). Cheers!

","Add pitted dates to a food processor or high-speed blender and blend until a caramel-like paste is achieved. If you have trouble blending, add 2-4 Tbsp warm water (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to help achieve the right texture - thick and spreadable. Scrape down sides as needed and blend until a thick, caramel-like consistency is achieved.Once the date caramel is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 - 1/2 tsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) sea salt depending on how salty you prefer it. Taste and adjust as needed.Scoop out caramel and set aside. Then add coconut cream (or coconut milk + coconut oil), vanilla, 1/2 cup of the date caramel, and 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup or agave nectar for additional sweetness (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Blend until creamy and smooth and taste and adjust flavors as needed. Bourbon is optional, but recommended for flavor.Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl, cover and chill in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours (or freezer for 1-2 hours) for best results. (If you're impatient and can't wait, skip this step. The Popsicles just won't be as swirled as if you were to let the batter chill.)Once chilled, add the remaining caramel back in in small spoonfuls and loosely stir to combine / swirl.Scoop/pour into Popsicle or ice cube molds (about 10, depending on their size // as original recipe is written) trying to evenly distribute the caramel swirls, and tap to remove air bubbles. Insert Popsicle sticks and freeze for at least 6 hours or until firm.Once set, remove from freezer and let rest for 5 minutes to soften. Then gently pull out of molds and enjoy. Pops keep covered in the freezer for up to 1 week, though best when fresh."

Who’s ready for Valentine’s Day?!

Valentine’s Day holds some funnytraditions for John and me.
When we were dating I had a very health-conscious roommate who would occasionally go all out on hard cider and a bucket of fried food (namely chicken and biscuits). It was like hearingthe pope swear – mind blowing.
Valentine’s Day was just a few days away andafter seeing my friend relish inher bigsplurge, we decided to follow suit. And what would trashy food be without a good comedy flick? Nacho Libreis our go-to choice every time.
Pretty much every Valentine’s Daysince, we’ve indulged in some form of junk food and hard cider and watched Nacho. This year, I think I may need to add these truffles to the mix. They’re too simple and too delicious not to.

These may not be truffles in the traditional sense, but they certainly fool the palette into thinking you’re indulging in a decadent chocolate truffle.
The center is made of dates, cocoa powder, raw nuts, cinnamon and sea salt, and semisweet chocolate and coconut oil form a decadent dark chocolate “shell.”
Toppings are optional but recommended for an extra something special. I went with pecans, sea salt and cacao nibs! No regrets.

I think you’re going to love these gems. They’re:
Simple (30 minutes)
Healthy
Naturally sweetened
Super chocolaty
Decadent
Nutty
&amp; Super satisfying

If you try these truffles, show us! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram – we’d love to see! Happy Valentine’s week, friends! We hope it’s lovely.

","Place pecans and walnuts in a food processor or high speed blender and process until it reaches the consistency of a meal. Remove and set aside in a dish.Next, place pitted dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and/or it forms into a ball.Then add in the cocoa powder and 1/2 of the nut meal and pulse. Continue pulsing and adding the nut meal a little at a time until a loose dough is formed. You may not need to use all of the nuts, which is fine because you can use any leftovers for topping the truffles.Once you have a dough that's easy to form into balls, scoop out 1 Tablespoon amounts and roll/carefully form into balls. (If they aren't quite forming, hold in your palm and let the heat of your hand warm them, then gently shape into a loose ball.) Set on parchment paper and place in freezer to chill - you should have about 14 truffles.In the meantime, melt chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Be careful not to overheat. Once melted, stir in coconut oil to help the chocolate thin and ease the dipping process.Remove truffles from freezer and, one at a time, dip them into the melted chocolate. Use a fork to remove them and tap away excess chocolate. Transfer back onto parchment paper and top with sea salt, crushed pecans, or cacao nibs.Repeat until all truffles are dipped. Let set at room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage."
556,Panko Baked Avocado Tacos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Panko Baked Avocado Tacos

I know what you’re thinking.
Avocados: Do they get any better?
Answer: Yes. Yes, they do.
How? When you roll them in spicypanko bread crumbs and bake them to crispy perfection.
THAT’S HOW.
Let’s do this.

One of my favorite thingsabout Mexican food is the guacamole.But lately, I’ve been branching out and puttingavocados atop sweet potatoes, toast, burgers, and more recently, panko-breading them!
This genius conceptwas inspired by the panko avocado tacos at Port Fonda – mylast meal in Kansas City! It was so memorable I knew I had to recreate them at home.

Once seasoned and breaded, the avocados take 10 minutes to bake, giving you the perfect amount of time to prep your taco ingredients.I went simple:
Cilantro
Hot sauce
&amp; Quick-pickled radish
But you could also add beans, salsa, tomato, onion, or whatever else you fancy. That’s the beauty of tacos, no?

I think you guys are going to love these tacos! They’re
Quick
Satisfying
At-home gourmet
Creamy on the inside
Crunchy on the outside
Flavorful
Delicious
&amp; Nutrient-rich
These would make an excellent new takeon Mexican night, or served as is with salsa for more of a “chip and dip” situation. You really can’t go wrong with these buttery, crispy dream boats. I’m in love.
If you try this recipe, please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see! It seriously makes our day. Cheers, friends!

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C), line a baking sheet with foil, and prepare dipping stations by whisking together almond milk and oil in a shallow bowl and mixing panko bread crumbs and spices in another shallow bowl.Halve avocados and carefully use a large knife to cut into the pits, twist and remove. Then lay avocado halves skin side down and cut into 3 equal parts. Each avocado should yield 6 pieces. Repeat until you have 12 pieces (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Gently peel away skin.Dip avocados first into almond-olive oil mixture, then transfer to the panko-spice mixture and use a spoon to gently coat. Carefully transfer to foil-lined baking sheet and repeat until all avocados are coated.Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned on the exterior.While avocados are baking, prep toppings. Warm beans + season to taste, slice lime, chop cilantro.When avocados are done baking, remove from oven and immediately assemble tacos. They taste best when fresh.I topped mine with pickled radish slices, hot sauce, cilantro and fresh lime juice. Black or pinto beans would also make a great addition for more fiber and protein. Leftovers do not store well, so only make as many avocados as needed."
557,Vegan Chocolate Cupcakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes

Can we just take a moment and revel in the deliciousness that is this chocolate cupcake?
*reflective silence*
OK, let’s proceed.

These cupcakes are my golden unicorn.
I have been tryingto make a vegan gluten free cupcake for quite some time now but couldn’t quite get it right. Finally, I prevailed.
Maybe the vegan gluten-free baking heavens parted and granted me favor.
Maybe it was the dancing I did while they were in the oven.
Or maybe I finally craftedthe perfect mix of carefully measured ingredients.
(Likely the latter.)
Either way, Ifinally cracked the code and I couldn’t be more thrilled to share this recipe with you guys!


The recipe may include more than my usual 10 ingredients by just a handful, but it only requires one bowl!
And in case you haven’t noticed, no fancy equipment is required as I do all my baking with basic equipment, including a hand held mixer! We keep things old school around here. Plus, have you seen the counter space I’m working with? Where would I put a stand mixer?! Oy.


I think the magic is in the beet puree and blend of gluten-free flours.
Beet puree not only adds anamazing magenta color to the batter (that disappears while baking), but extra moist texture and a ton of amazing nutrition benefits like vitamins A, B, C, magnesium, fiber and folate, just to name a few.
As for the gluten free flours, I’ve found that gluten-free baking requiresa mixof dry ingredients. In this recipe, that included a blendof cocoa powder, almond meal, gluten-free oat flour, and a gluten-free flour blend. I tested the recipe with two blends, so see the notes for details!In my experience, the blend makes all the difference.

I was so pleased when I pulled theseout of the oven and saw howfluffy and perfectthey were,just like regular cupcakes. The only thing left to do was frost them with a thick, fudgy, chocolate ganache frosting! Whoa mama.

This frosting (made in the same bowl!) requires just 4 ingredients and 30 minutes, and it’s insanelydelicious. Super thick,fudgy, and fluffy atop these insanely moist, delicious cupcakes. I plan on frosting everything with this ganache from here on out.

Let’s talk cupcakes. These gems are:
Fluffy
Moist
Cakey
Super chocolaty
Perfectly sweet
Undetectably vegan and gluten-free
&amp; Simply AMAZING
After sampling these myself I couldn’t believe my taste buds! I’d struck gold.So I tested them on some friends who all agreed theywere incredible.
I had a hard time naming them so I’ve decided to callthem what they are: The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes! But seriously,more likethe best cupcake I’ve ever had. Yep, I said it.

","FOR BEETS: To roast beets, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C), drizzle 2 large beets (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) with oil of choice, and wrap in foil. Bake for 50 minutes - 1 hour or until a knife slides through easily. Peel away skins by rubbing foil around and it should shed off easily. Add beets to a food processor or blender and add 1/4 cup liquid of choice (I like a mix of water and orange juice // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Blend until creamy, smooth and pourable, scraping down sides as needed. Otherwise, sub another fruit puree, such as applesauce, with varied results.FOR CUPCAKES: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line 11 muffins (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) with paper liners, or lightly grease. Also measure out almond milk and add vinegar. Stir and let curdle while moving onto the next step.Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add baking soda to the almond milk vinegar mixture and stir. It should fizz.Add the sugar, maple syrup, and almond milk mixture to the flax egg and beat to combine. Then add beet puree, melted coconut oil, and salt and mix.Add cocoa powder, almond meal, oat flour, and gluten-free flour blend and beat to combine. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk, but it should be perfect. If too thin, add a little more gluten-free flour blend + cocoa powder. It should resemble a thin batter that’s pourable.Divide batter evenly between muffin tins, filling 3/4 full.Bake for 29-34 minutes or until puffy and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Let rest in the tin for 10-15 minutes. Then remove and let cool COMPLETELY on a cooling rack. Don’t try to sample early because they need to fully cool or they tend to stick to the wrappers.FOR FROSTING: Add almond milk to your rinsed out mixing bowl from earlier and microwave for 1 minute. (Alternatively, heat in a saucepan until just simmering and then transfer back to mixing bowl.)Immediately add chocolate to warm milk but don’t touch for 2 minutes so it can melt.Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate, then add softened butter and cover. Let rest untouched for another 10 minutes to meddle.Use your mixer to beat the mixture together. Then add 1 cup powdered sugar (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), mix again, and place in fridge to set for 20-30 minutes. You’ll know it’s ready when you tip it and it’s slow to move.Remove from fridge and beat again. If it’s still too thin, add another 1/4 - 1/2 cup powdered sugar (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and beat until light and fluffy. I found that chilling for a total of 20 minutes and adding 1 3/4 cups total powdered sugar was perfect (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Frost cupcakes generously. You’ll likely have leftover frosting (unless you’re like me). Sprinkles, mint leaves, or fresh raspberries would make the perfect garnish.Will keep well-covered at room temperature for several days, though best when fresh."

It’s becoming no secret that I have a thing for tequila (exhibit a, b, and c).
Though wine still holds a special place in my heart, margaritas may just be my favorite drink. So it’s no wonder I keep dreaming up new flavor combinations.


This particular recipe was inspiredby a trip to visit friends in D.C. last summer. We went to a bottomlessbrunch (yes, all you can eat and drink!) at a Mexican restaurant where they served boozy hibiscus agua fresca.
Oh dear – so good. I couldn’t shake the tart, sweet, refreshing beveragefrom my mind. I had to recreate it. This is my spin.
This drink starts out with the hibiscus tea concentrate made from hibiscus tea, water and yoursweetener of choice.
The whole process is quick and painless andyieldsa gorgeous, deep magentahibiscus tea concentrate perfect for adding a floral, tart-sweet punch to your favorite cocktails.

The best part about this cocktail besides the fact that it’s tea based and practically health food? THECOLOR.

","To make the hibiscus tea concentrate, bring 3 cups water to a boil, add hibiscus tea, stir, remove from heat and let steep for 30 minutes.Strain into a jar or glass container using a fine mesh strainer and add sweetener to taste. I found 1/3 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) was about the right amount, using half agave nectar, half cane sugar. Stir to dissolve and let cool.To make two margaritas, add ice, cooled hibiscus tea concentrate, lime juice, tequila and 1 Tbsp agave nectar (optional // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously to combine.Pour over two glasses with ice. We love this oversized ice cube mold for cocktails. Salt or sugar rim is optional. Garnish with lime wedge.

A vacation was much-needed, especially after a cross-country move, rather stressful end of year, and low vitamin D levels. OK, I can’t confirm that last one, but come on – we live in Oregon. The sun shines here for 3 hours a dayand we were in need of some serious beach time!
We have also been in need of some serious Vitamin C and bright, cheeryfoods to rally us through to spring. Is anyone else in the same boat? If so, we have just the solution: This 5-ingredient Coconut Clementine smoothie that’s perfectly sweet, creamy and mega refreshing.
The beauty of a smoothie, of course, is that you take whatever’s in season, throw it in a blender and hope for the best!
That’s kind of how this smoothie came together. I have a serious obsession with coconut milk these days. Add in some gorgeous winter clementines, a handful of my favorite greens and ka-blam! Smoothie magic.

This little gem is perfect for curing the winter blues. It’s:
Super green
Loadedwith immune-boosting vitamins + nutrients
Perfectly sweet

Fresh
Not too sweet
&amp; Kind of a dream
I love this type of smoothie alongside something a little more substantial, like a tofu scramble, breakfast potatoes, or hummus toast.But it would also make a great post workout drinkwith the addition of yourfavorite protein powder.

My favorite way to have sweet potato fries is alongside a hearty veggie burger. But these really are perfect as is as a snack or appetizer. And if you aren’t into super spicy foods, just scale back on the cayenne for slightly less heat without sacrificing flavor.

561,Simple Grain-Free Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Grain-Free Granola

One of my resolutions this year is to eat less sugar and grains.
I know. It’s a baking blog.But I’m on a mission to prove that eating healthy can be fun, taste delicious,and be disguised as indulgent.
For instance, this 30-minute, 10-ish ingredient granola!

This recipe packs a serious punch in the way of healthy fats, omega 3s and protein from plenty of nuts and seeds. Andit’s naturally sweetened with coconut sugar (a first for me!) and maple syrup. Coconut oil helps it crisp up without influencing the flavor.

Because this granola doesn’t have any grains, it’s extremely nutrient rich:
6.2 grams of protein +4.7 grams of fiber per 1/4 cup serving!
You can either eat it as is orwith your favorite dairy-free milk of yogurt. Or, if you’re like me and can’t kick cereal altogether, it makes a great addition to bran flakes to bulk up the protein content.

This granola is my new favorite. It’s
Nutty
Crunchy
Perfectlysweet
Hearty
Satisfying
Nutrient-rich
Simple
&amp; Quick
It’s also extremely customizable. Just use whatever nuts and seeds you have on hand and make it your own. I scored some dried wild blueberries at Trader Joe’s, but I also think it would be amazing with dried cherries or cranberries.

Then remove from oven, add dried blueberries and roasted sunflower seeds, and stir.Increase heat to 340 degrees F (171 C) and return to oven for another 5-8 minutes, or until deep golden brown.The coconut oil will help this granola crisp up nicely, but be sure to watch it carefully as it browns quickly.Once the granola is visibly browned and done cooking (about 27 minutes total for me), remove from the oven and let cool completely.Store in a container with an air-tight seal, and it should keep for a few weeks."
562,Sweet Potato Black Bean Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Black Bean Burger

Some days, you just need a burger. If today is one of those days, I’m here for you.

This burger was inspired by my favorite veggie burger in Kansas City found at Beer Kitchen – the amazing restaurant that inspired thisWhiskey BBQ Ketchup.
Their “black bean burger” had a modest description but the flavor and texture areanything but. It’s tender without being mushy, not too sweet, not too salty, hearty, and seriously satisfying.
On days that nothing sounded filling enough, this veggie burger was the only thing that did the trick.

This recipe not only fillsa veggie burger-shaped hole in my heart sincemovingout of arm’s reach of Beer Kitchen, it’s also simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and easy-to-master methods. Such as,

Bake sweet potato
Mash
Add rice, black beans, onions + spices
Mix
Mold
Bake

It’s so easy. Are you sensing a pattern here? Simple, delicious, and vegan + gluten-free? It’s practically sorcery.

I wrote the word “sweet” so many times I began questioning my ability to spell it correctly. Update: It’s definitely spelled s-w-e-e-t.
Speaking of sweet, this burger is the business. It’s:
Tender on the inside
Firm on the outside
Hearty
Naturallysweet
Savory
Subtly spiced + smoky
Simple
&amp; Seriously satisfying
May I make a recommendation? Make theseburgers and stack two patties on top of each other and make one ginormo burger (as pictured). Then we can be veggie burger bosses together.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cut sweet potatoes in half. Rub with olive oil and place face down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake sweet potatoes until soft and tender to the touch - about 30 minutes - set aside. Reduce oven heat to 375 degrees F (190 C).While potatoes are baking, cook rice or quinoa (see notes for instructions).Add black beans to a mixing bowl and mash half of them for texture. Then add sweet potato and lightly mash, then 1 cup rice (amount as original recipe is written // if altering batch size, start with lesser end of range), green onion, nut meal and spices. Mix to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more rice or nut meal if the mixture feels too wet. It should be very moist but moldable.Lightly grease a baking sheet and line a 1/4 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap.Fill the lined measuring cup with sweet potato mixture. Scrape down to pack, then lift out and transfer to the baking sheet and gently press down to mash. The thinner you press them, the faster they’ll cook, but no need to go too far. Just a gentle press will do.Bake burgers for a total 30-45 minutes, carefully flipping 20 minutes in to ensure even cooking. The longer you bake them the firmer and drier they will get - up to preference. I went for around the 35 minute mark.Serve on slider buns (double stack for more bulk) or atop a salad with sliced avocado, red onion, greens, and ketchup or salsa.Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a few days. Freeze for longer term storage."
563,How to Make Almond Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Almond Milk


While I love the convenience of store-bought almond milk, sometimes it’s fun to makeit yourself! This recipe allows you to control the amount of sweetness and infuse flavors as well as play around with the thickness. It’s my go-to when I’m craving homemade dairy-free milk.
","Add your soaked almonds, water, salt, and any additional add-ins (optional) to a high-speed blenderand blend until creamy and smooth. Keep it running for at least 1-2 minutes so you get the most out of your almonds.Strain using a nut milk bag or my favorite trick - a thin dish towel. Simply lay a clean dish towel over a mixing bowl, pour over the almond milk, carefully gather the corners, and lift up. Then squeeze until all of the liquid is extracted. Discard pulp, or save for adding to baked goods (especially crackers).Transfer milk to a jar or covered bottle and refrigerate. Will keep for up to a few days, though best when fresh. Shake well before drinking, as it tends to separate."
564,Dark Chocolate Peppermint Mousse | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Dark Chocolate Peppermint Mousse

Now that your sweet tooth has hadample time to recoverfrom the holidays, let’s do something fun with those leftover peppermint candies you have.
Get your dark chocolate and let’s make some mousse (with just 3 ingredients)!

Since discovering the deliciousness that is vegan mousse, I haven’t been able to stop.
This chocolate peppermint version has been on my mind for quite a whilenow, especially since becoming a chocolate-mintconvert. They just belong together, am I right?

This mousse starts with coconut cream and gets its rich chocolate flavor from a healthy dose of melted dairy-free dark chocolate. The mint infusion comes from pure peppermint extract to add that subtlecool, minty flavor.
One bite and I was in love. I mean, look at that! How could you not be?

For serving you can either get all fancy and pipe it into serving dishes, or just spoon away for the sake of ease!
And if you’re like me, no dessert is complete without a garnish – in this case ample amounts of coconut whipped cream and crushed peppermint candy.

This mousse is everything. It’s:
Rich
Fluffy
Insanely thick
Perfectly sweet
Crazy chocolaty
Mint infused
Decadent
Simple
Perfect
&amp; A chocolate-mint lover’s dream
This would make the perfect end to any hearty winter meal. And with virtually zero effort,it comes together so fastand will make you look like a top chef!
Not into mint? You could also just sub the mint for 1/4 cup salted peanut butter, or leave it plain and top it with fresh raspberries or bananas. You really can’t go wrong!

RECIPE updated: September 6, 2016 to include a new method for ensuring the chocolate entirely melts into the coconut cream and make a fluffy, seamless mousse!
","Coconut cream is best in this recipe. If using full-fat coconut milk, do your best to scoop out only the cream and reserve the leftover liquid in the bottom of the can for other uses (like smoothies), and use 1/2 cup less chocolate*. Otherwise, use coconut cream and add the full amount of chocolate.Melt chocolate in the microwave in 30 second increments or over a double boiler until creamy and smooth (be careful not to cook past melting point).Add coconut cream to a medium or large mixing bowl along with melted chocolate and whisk thoroughly to combine. Add peppermint oil and mix once more. Start with 1/8 tsp, then graduate up to 1/4 tsp depending on desired mintiness (amounts as original recipe is written // start with lesser end of range and increase as desired).Cover and set mixture in the refrigerator to chill fully - about 4 hours. You'll know it's ready to whip when the mixture no longer sloshes around when tipped side to side.Once chilled and semi-firm, whip until creamy and smooth with a hand mixer, scraping down sides as needed.At this point you can either transfer to a piping bag or large plastic bag (with the corner clipped off) to ""pipe"" into dishes. Otherwise, use a spoon to divide between 3-4 serving ramekins (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) or short drinking glasses and cover with plastic wrap.Enjoy as is, or chill for 30 more minutes to allow the mousse to firm up even more (or chill overnight).To serve, top with coconut whipped cream, crushed peppermint, and/or chocolate shavings or cocoa or cacao powder.Leftovers will keep in the fridge up to 3-4 days, though best when fresh. I haven't tried freezing this recipe and wouldn't recommend it."
565,Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble

We’re brunch people.
That’s one of the things we missed most about Portland – it’s somewhat of abreakfast and brunch mecca. Come taste, and you will see.
One of the first things we did whenwe got backwas go to Bijou Cafe – our favorite breakfast spot. It was there that I discovered the tofu scramble that t0ppedall other tofu scrambles – a masala-spiced, veggie-loaded, savory scramble that haunted me for days after we left.
Fear not, I was immediately on the case and am thrilled to report that I have NAILED this thing down to the very spices.Let’s get to brunching!

The star of this recipe is the tandoori masala spice blend. If you’re not a spicy-food person, fear not! This is a complex spice blend that isn’t spicy in a hot way, just flavorful.
I did a little research about masala spice blends and it can get a little complicated so I picked one up at Whole Foods to see if it came close. Secret time? I’m convinced it’s what the folks at Bijou use.
But, if you don’t have access to the Tandoor Masala spice blend at Whole Foods, I’ve included a blend below that should get you pretty darn close.

One of the things I love most about this scramble is the exceptional use of cauliflower.
Let’s be real, nobody likes cauliflower. But in this scramble, it’s my favorite part! It adds so much heartiness and texture and blends perfectly with the red onions and kale.
Kalamata olives add a salty touch that brings the whole thing together.


My favorite part – it’s simple!
30 minutes
9 ingredients
No fancy methods required
If you can roast veggies and shake on spices, you can make this dish!

And make it you should. It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Savory
Perfectly spiced
Loaded with veggies
Protein-packed
Complex but simple to make
Quick
&amp; Satisfying
Here’s the thing, I think I’ve made this recipe so close to the original at the restaurant that I like mine a little more! I know, it’s serious. Plus, I get to eat it withmy Best Damn Vegan Breakfast Potatoes that cannot be trumped.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top (like a cast iron skillet or tea pot) to begin drying.Add chopped onion and cauliflower to a large mixing bowl with 2 Tbsp oil, 3 Tbsp masala spice blend and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and toss to combine. You want it very heavily seasoned - almost all visibly coated (see photo) - so add more spice if necessary.Add to a lightly greased or foil lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.In the meantime, add kale to the mixing bowl you used before and toss with another dash of oil and a shake of masala spice, salt, and pepper. Massage to coat.At the 20 minute mark, stir cauliflower and onion to cook evenly and add the kale to one end of the baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes more.Move onto the tofu while veggies are baking: Preheat large skillet to medium, medium-high heat.While heating, to the same mixing bowl you used before, add the tofu and use a fork to piece it apart. Add chopped olives, 1 Tbsp oil and another healthy shake (~ 1 heaping Tbsp) masala blend (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), salt, and pepper. Optional: I also added a dash of hot sauce for color. If using parsley, add half at this time for color and reserve the rest for garnish/serving.Once the pan is hot, add a bit more oil and then the tofu mixture. Continue cooking and stirring (adding more masala if desired) for about 5 minutes, or until it looks visibly browned and dry.To serve, place the cauliflower/kale/onion mixture on the serving plates and top with tofu scramble. Garnish with a bit more fresh parsley and serve with hot sauce and breakfast potatoes, if desired. Although, I think it’s perfect on its own.Store leftovers in the fridge, covered for up to 2 days, though best when fresh."
566,Vegan Protein Sources | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"15 Vegan Protein Sources + Easy Hummus Toast

When I first started experimenting with vegetarianism and later veganism, one of the most difficultparts was figuring out how to getenough protein in my diet, and more importantly, how to get protein from a broad and healthy range of sources.
Trust me, if it was healthy to survive on peanut butter alone, I totally would.
Protein seems to be a murky topic.People either think we’reeither notgetting enough and “MORE PROTEIN” becomes their gospel, or they think weshould all calmdown and eat less protein lest we turn into body-building savages.
According to most experts, we should aim to get 10% – 35% of our calories from protein. For women, that’s around 46 grams a day, and for men, 56 grams a day. To be honest, I fall short of that most days, but I’m working on it! I’m aiming to fill up on nutrient-rich sources instead of justchips + guac (so guilty).
This post is around up of my 15 favorite vegan protein sources. No matter what kind of diet you follow – vegan or not – this post is meant to educate and inspire!You don’t have to be vegan to enjoy animal-free protein sources.
Lastly, it’s not all about the protein – we need to keep our vitamins and minerals in check, too. So be sure to educate yourself and consult a professionalbefore makingany drastic changes to your diet!

Now, onto my favorite breakfast these days!
I have been loving my Best Damn Breakfast Potatoes, a green smoothie, and some sprouted toast with hummus, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds! Wow, that just made me sound like the biggest hippie. I don’t care – it’s so tasty and filling!
Now for the protein math.
1piece sprouted toast = 5 grams
3 Tbsp hummus = 3 grams
1 tsp hemp seeds = 1 gram
1 Tbsp sunflower seeds = 2 grams
1 green smoothie = 6 grams
1 serving breakfast potatoes = 2 grams
TOTAL = 19grams
Not bad! What’s your go-to breakfast these days? I’d love to know. Cheers, friends!

567,Vegan Chai Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chai Latte

Do I miss the Midwest? Hmmm.
I don’t miss needing a car to go everywhere.
And I don’t miss the freezing temps, ice and snow.
But I domiss family and friends,
our little corner apartment,
and my goodness do I miss the chai lattesat Kaldi’s.
I shudder just thinking about how good they were.
It’s been weeks and I’m having withdrawals. Straight -withdrawals.
I suppose it’s timeI learn to make them at home.
You see where this is going.
From scratchvegan chai lattes at home – we’re doing this.

First of all, if you are ever in Kansas City on the Plaza, go to Kaldi’s and try their chai latte. It’s the best I’ve ever had. Not that I’ve tried anything authentic from the source, but of my many coffeeshop experiences, it’s hands down the best.
Creamy
Perfectly spiced
Not too sweet
Foamy
Luscious
Piping hot
&amp; Addictive

I’ve done my best to make the latte of my dreams at home and thinkI’ve nailed it!
I even did my research on what goes into those sneaky powder mixes coffee shops use, which they assure me aredairy-free. I still have my suspicions…
This latte? It’s from scratch. No powders, no pre-mixed packets, no pre-fab concentrate. We’re going old school.

For this latte you’ll need:

black or chai tea
ground or whole chai spices (listed below)
sweetener of choice (cane sugar, maple syrup, stevia)
vanilla extract
dairy-free milk of choice (almond is best)
raw cashews (optional for thickening)
coconut whipped cream for topping (optional, but c’mon)


Because everyone really wants whipped cream on their latte. I will cry the day coffee shops offer dairy-free whip; tears of joy.
The method is simple and allows for customizing. Steep tea with spices in water. Sweeten to taste and add dairy-free milk forcreaminess. Strain and serve.
At that point you can thicken with cashew cream and heat a little in the microwave or stovetop once more, and top with coconut whipped cream + ground cinnamon.
The result is a perfectly spicy-sweet chai latte that rivals most coffeehouse offerings.
If you try this chai latte, let us know what you think (and leave any tips you might have)! Leave a comment, tell us on social media, orour favorite – tag a picture #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see.

","Add water, tea and spices to a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for another 10-15 minutes to fully steep.Remove from heat and add almond milk and sweetener of choice and stir. Warm for 2-3 minutes off the heat, and then pour over 2 serving mugs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) using a fine mesh strainer.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more for sugar or maple syrup (or honey if not vegan) for sweetness, and ground cinnamon for a little extra warmth.OPTIONAL: For extra creamy texture, add your chai tea mixture + soaked cashews to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust sweetness/seasonings as needed. I added more sweetener, ground cinnamon and ground ginger for extra spice.Either reheat briefly on the stovetop or microwave and serve. Heat modestly as the mixture can thicken quite a bit when reheated for too long (due to the cashews). If it gets too thick, thin with more almond milk or water.Top with coconut whip and a dash of cinnamon and serve. Leftovers keep well covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh."
568,Kale Citrus Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Kale Citrus Salad

“Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” – Mary Oliver
I couldn’t resist sharing thisquote from Essentialism by Greg McKeown,a bookI’m very nerdily listening to on audio while working. This bookcame to me atthe perfect time at the recommendation of my fashion blogger crush, Caroline of Un-Fancy. If you’re into minimalist fashion, you need to go to there.
Essentialismis such a good read this time of year, especially for those looking to purify, simplify, and sift down to what’sreally important. It’s so easy to fall intoreacting instead of making intentional choices, no?
I believe the above quote puts it exquisitely: We have one wild and insanely beautiful life, it’s going by quickly, what are wegoing to do with it?
It’s just the gut check I needed for 2015.

As you might imagine, since we announced we’re pursuing a self-published print cookbook this year I am in fact now working on saidcookbook. That’s kind of how thatworks.
It’s aproject we’ve been talking about for a whilenow, and I can hardly express how excited I am to finally be in the midst of it.
But can I be honest? I’mfeeling a little paralyzed at the thought of it all. It’s an endurance race and I prefer sprints. The idea ofworking on something for a whole year is utterly overwhelming to me. How doI cope? Am I even capable? Practically speaking, when willI have time to sleep with arecipe list that’slonger than a college syllabus?
I was journalingthe other day and foundmyself asking these questions:

Do I need to start doing less?
Become a better planner?
Get more zen in themorning and the eveningto center myself amidstthe storm?

Yes, we maintain a blog and an Instagram feed and reply to comments and emails and makeproducts, and although John and I do this full time, it becomes daily apparent how quickly time slips by and how little time we actually have to do the things we say we want to do. We usually end up talking over breakfast about what we hopeto accomplish inthe day. The joke has become “Well, I’m just going to do everything on my to-do list and then I’ll be happy.”
Guess what? It rarelyhappens.Too much stuff, not enough time, and more importantly, not enough intention.

This book and this project have me realizing two things:

I need to figure out what is essential for me to do each day. Thatis essential.
Do only those things. Then stop.

Sounds simple enough but then it becomes surprisingly difficultthe minute I lift my head off my pillow in the morning.
The good news? I’m not actually complaining about any of this – I’m excited. And, it’s causing me to focus and refine – two very positive things.
The better news? I’ve found a solution to all my worrying and fumbling: Don’t over commit.
Before, I used to put 4-5 things on my daily to do listand that would instantlymake me feel anxious and overwhelmed bytheday’s activities. I’m kind of a work horse and I like a challenge so overloading had become my default.
Now, I’m scheduling 2-3 thingseach day. Manageable, achievable, less stress, deep breathe in and out –I can do this.
There is still no doubt a mountain of work ahead of me this year – very meaningful work I care passionately about. Nonetheless, it’s a marathon – I like sprints. But, choosing to tackle onlythe essentials each day is leaving me feeling much more capable and confident, and mostimportantly – at ease.

Another thing I’m working on this year? Upping my salad game.
Kale and grapefruit are literally all I think about this time of year so it was only fate that they came together in this simple, 30-minute salad with quick pickled red onions and an easy red wine vinaigrette.
Loads of kale, pomegranate, red onion, grapefruit, cranberries, and green applemake this salad hearty and substantial and loaded with fiber. If you love quick, crisp salads with a balance of tart and sweet, this is the one for you.


Another thing that influences how I work during the day is how well I eat. I’m busy and need quick, simple, healthy mealswithin reach at all times. Kale Citrus Salad to the rescue.
I think you guys are going to love this salad! It utilizes some of winter’s most gorgeous and nutrient-rich produce and is both delicious and customizable. To make it a complete meal, add your protein of choice – quinoa, sunflower seeds, and roasted pecans area few ofmy favorites.

If you’re finding yourself feeling a little overwhelmed these days, take a deep breatheand figure out what’s essential. Then, only do those things (or at least try really hard to). Making this salad wouldn’t hurt either.
Friends, here’s to a less-frantic, more relaxed and focused 2015. Cheers!

","Pickle onions by mixing red wine vinegar, water, and sugar in a small bowl and stirring to dissolve. Add sliced onions and let set in the fridge while prepping the rest of the salad. The liquid should cover the onion, so add a bit more vinegar and/or water if needed.Add kale to a large mixing bowl with 1-2 tsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) olive oil and squeeze over reserved grapefruit or orange juice. Use your fingers to massage the kale to break down the bitterness and stiffness.Next add apple, grapefruit or orange segments, and pomegranate or cranberries and set aside.Prepare dressing in a small mixing bowl by whisking vinegar, mustard, sweetener, and salt and pepper. Stream in olive oil while mixing, then taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a splash of orange juice to brighten up the flavors, but this is optional.Add pickled onions to the salad, as well as the dressing (or reserve it for serving), toss and serve.

I’m kind of a big sandwich girl. As in, I like sandwiches and I like them big.

I distinctly remembera time whereI was dining withmy 6’4″ father at Subway. He stopped at a 6-inch sandwich, I went for the foot-long. I scarfed both halves down and he looked on horrified.
In high schoolI remember having a friend run out to grabme a sandwich for lunch. I handed him a $10 and asked for: 1 foot long, 1 bag of chips, and 1cookie. No 2cookies. Yes, 2.
No wonder dinner invites were sparse.

This is notyour average sandwich. For starters, it’s meatless!Second, it’s extremely flavorful, filling and healthy – basically the three things I’m going for with any good sandwich. And lastly, it is simple: just 30 minutes andsimple ingredientsrequired.
The base starts with tender, smashed chickpeas and nutrient-rich sunflower seeds that add a nutty, crunchy touch. Then comes thesimple dressing of dairy-free mayo, mustard, dill, maple syrup for added sweetness, and a handful of simple spices.
Come to mama.

All of that goodness is mashed up and piled on top of hearty, toasted wheat bread with tomato, onion, lettuce, and a healthy drizzle of my secret garlic sauce. Never forget the sauce.
Does lunch get any better? I think not.

Spring rolls are just spring rolls,but peanut sauce elevates them to amazing. They’re just naked without it. For some extra kick, I added some fresh grated ginger – a throw back to my Asian noodle bowl – and the result is a perfectly salty-sweet sauce with some zing. I’m in love.

Need more reason to love these rolls? Good. They’re:
Light
Fresh
Healthy
Crunchy
Loaded withveggies and fresh herbs
Perfect withpeanut sauce
Simple – no cooking
&amp; quick – just 30 minutes
These make a delicious light lunch or dinner and leftoverssave well for the next day – just see my note about the mango!
I hope you guys love these. If you do give them a try, let us know! Leave a comment or tag an Instagram #minimalistbaker so we can see. Cheers!

","Prep veggies and set aside for easy assembly. For the beet, I used this mandolin. You can find all of our Simple Kitchen Essentials here.Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan or kettle and set aside to cool slightly for cooking rice papers.Prepare peanut sauce by adding all ingredients except water to a mixing bowl and whisking. Add hot water 1 Tbsp at a time and whisk until desired consistency is achieved (should be pourable but thick). Set aside.Add hot water to a large shallow dish (I used a skillet) and submerge a rice paper to soften for about 10-20 seconds. If you let it go too long or if your water is too hot, they will get too fragile to work with.Once soft, transfer to a clean, slightly damp surface (I prefer a wooden cutting board), and gently smooth out into a circle.Add carrots, peppers, mango, beets, and a healthy handful each cilantro and mint (and any other desired fillings). Fold bottom over the fillings, then gently roll over once and fold in the side to seal, then roll until completely sealed. Place on a serving plate and top with a room temperature damp towel to keep fresh.Repeat process until all toppings are used - about 7 or 8 (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Serve with dipping sauce and sriracha, if desired.Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a couple days, though best when fresh."
573,Grapefruit Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Grapefruit Green Smoothie

I don’t know about you guys, but when I find something I like I generally stick to it.
The good thing about that is I get really good at making whatever that thing is. For instance,my favorite green smoothie. On the flip side, staying the coursehas its downsides asI rarely want tobranch out and try something new. We’re about to change that.

With a brand new year in front of us, I’m resolving to step out of my comfort zone and try new things. One thing on my list is try new smoothies.
I knew I wanted to incorporate grapefruit since it’s in season and has always been one of my favorites fruits. My mom used to cut them in halffor me when I was little and I’d happily eat away at them with a baby spoon.
Not to mention, grapefruit is extragood for you this time of year with plenty ofimmune-boosting Vitamin Cto help ward off colds, lycopene, and free-radical fighting antioxidants.
This smoothie is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients and 10 minutes.
In addition to health benefits from the grapefruit, it also hasplenty of potassium and fiber from banana and apple, which add a creamy, natural sweetness I adore.
As far as texture, it’s somewhere between a juiceand creamy like a traditional smoothie. In other words, light and super refreshing.

I think you guys are going to love this smoothie! It’s:
Cold
Slightly tart
Perfectly sweet
Refreshing
Loaded withnutrients
Simple
Fast
&amp; Perfect for hitting the reset button on your diet
Another perk? It’s husband approved! John enjoyedthis recipeand he’s not as adventurous as I am in the smoothie department. Definitely a win in my book.
If you guys make this smoothie, please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker onInstagram – we’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

","Add all ingredients to a blender (including reserved grapefruit juice) and blend until creamy and smooth. Add more liquid if too thick, ice to thicken, and banana or apple to sweeten. Serves 2 (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)."

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Place chopped apple on a baking sheet and toss with olive oil, maple syrup, cinnamon, and sea salt. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until soft and fragrant. Set aside.In a food processor, grind nuts into a meal - a few chunkier pieces are OK. Then add dates and pulse until a loose dough is formed. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl.Give the baked apples another chop with a sharp knife so the pieces aren’t so large. Slowly add apples a few Tbsp at a time until the mixture forms a moist dough. If your mixture got too wet, simply add more ground walnuts, almonds, or even a handful oats. Reserve leftover apples for other use (oatmeal, smoothies, yogurt, etc.)Transfer mixture to parchment-lined loaf pan and spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Top with plastic wrap and use fingers to press it firmly into all corners until uniformly flat on top. For extra thickness, cram the mixture into 3/4 of the pan and reserve a blank space. This will make less bars, but they will be much thicker. Cover and freeze to set.Chop into desired number of bars - anywhere from 4-8 (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).To store, pack in a bag or container and place a piece of parchment between each bar so they don’t stick together. l keep mine in the freezer to stay fresher longer, but the refrigerator is fine, too.If you’re traveling, they should be fine for a day or so. But keep them refrigerated or frozen otherwise."

576,Vegan Green Bean Casserole | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Green Bean Casserole

Friends, it’s that time of year to make something cozy and nostalgic and eat one too many servings. For me, that’s green bean casserole – a dish my mom used to make all the time for my sister and me growing up.
It’s simple, creamy, savory and healthy because there’s veggies, right? I suspect this was one of those dishes that my mom used to sneak more greens into our diets, despite our suspicion of all things salad-like. But who can resist anything baked in a creamy sauce and topped with crispy fried onions?
My mother was (is) a smart lady.



I’ve been wanting to make a vegan version of this childhood classic for a while now, and the holiday seasonfinally prompted me to do so.
I’m happy to report that my attemptwas a huge success and yielded a seriously delicious result. Bonus? It’s simple –just 10 ingredients and about 30 minutes from start to finish. Plus, once the green beans are boiled, it all happens in one pan! That’s my kind of side dish.

The magic happens when the crispy fried onions come on the scene – crunchy, salty and indulgent. You can make the onionsfrom scratch, but Trader Joe’s has somethat just happens to be vegan friendly. This saves time and hassle and is totally worth it in my opinion. Look at that crunch!
I think you guys are doing to love this dish. It’s
Simple
Savory
Loaded with veggies
Completely from scratch
Crunchy
Creamy
Comforting
&amp; Perfect for the holidays

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt well - it will help season the green beans. Add green beans and cook for 5 minutes, then drain and place in an ice water bath to stop cooking. Drain and set aside.In the meantime, start preparing sauce. In a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat, add vegan butter or olive oil and shallots and garlic. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add mushrooms and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes more or until lightly browned.Sprinkle in flour and whisk to stir and coat the veggies. Cook for 1 minute, then slowly add in veggie stock, whisking to incorporate.Add almond milk next and whisk to stir again. Season with a touch more salt and pepper and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low to thicken. Cook for 5-7 minutes more, or until thick and bubbly. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Remove from heat and add 1/3 of the fried onions (1/2 cup as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and all of the cooked green beans. Toss to coat well, and top with remaining fried onions.Bake for 15 minutes, or until warmed through and bubbly and slightly browned on top. Serve immediately (handle pan carefully).Leftovers store well in the fridge for up to a few days."
577,Healthy Peanut Butter Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Granola Bars

When I was in college I was the queen of snacks. I was away from home or my dorm 90% of the time, so I had to rely on quick meals to get me through the day, granola bars being one of my favorites.
Granola bars were granola bars, as far as I was concerned. That was, until I discovered the Larabar. Simple ingredients, naturally sweetened, amazing flavors – I was hooked after one bite of the apple pie flavor (a stellar recommendation from my sister – my longtime partner in healthy eating crime).

Though I’ve made date-sweetened granola bars in the past (see my 5 Ingredient Granola Bars, Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Bars, Super Seedy Bars, Brownie Granola Bars), I’ve yet to make a plain and and simple peanut butter version.
This simple, 3-ingredient recipe is an homage to my beloved Larabar Peanut Butter Cookie bar. After a recent trip to Trader’s left me in need of a snack, it wasthe first thing I reachedfor. As soon as I got to my car I downed that thinglike a champ and thought, “Yep, these need to happen on the blog.”
Well, it’s happening NOW.

These bars are so easy it’s almost a non-recipe.
Dates pulsed in a food processor, then mixed with natural salted peanut butter and rolled oats. The result is a salty-sweet dough that can either be rolled into snack balls or pressed into a pan and cut into bars that are super handy for on-the-go snacking.

These bars are seriously magic. They’re:
Vegan
Gluten Free
Peanut Buttery
Supa moist
Naturally sweetened
Hearty
Wholesome
Salty-sweet
Healthy
Portable
&amp; Yum yum
I thought these would makethe perfect on-the-road snack for those traveling next week for the holidays. Though John and I will be cozied up right in our little Portland apartment, eating Shepherd’s Pie, and watching an Office Christmas marathon, I’m considering making another batch of these gems solely for couch-time snacking.

Consider these bars alittle gift from me to you this holiday season. I hope all is merry and bright in your world, and you’re spending next week with the ones you love most.
And, speaking of gifts, if you’re looking for giftsfor foodies and aspiring home cooks, check out our Simple Kitchen Essentials post! It’s a top-to-bottom account of everything in our simple kitchen.
If you make these bars, pretty please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. Cheers!
","If your dates are not sticky and moist, soak in warm water for 10 minutes and then drain. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.Add dates to a food processor and pulse until only small bits remain - it will likely clump into a ball - that’s what you want. If any big pieces remain, use a knife or spatula to push them down, then turn the machine back on to pulse.Add peanut butter and oats and pulse a few more times until incorporated, stirring and scraping down sides as needed. If you prefer denser bars, add more oats.Transfer to a parchment-lined 8x8 dish and press down until flat, OR scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts and roll into a ball and place on a baking sheet or plate. Transfer to freezer to set.If making bars, slice into 8-10 bars (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and store in the fridge or freezer to keep fresh. They can be a little flimsy at room temp, so be gentle with how you stack them.Will keep in the fridge for several weeks and in the freezer for up to a couple months or more."
578,Creamy Spinach and Kale Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Kale and Spinach Dip

It’s about that time for holiday parties galore, and for that, you need a dip! IfI’m invited to your gathering, this is definitely the oneI’m bringing.
I take my appetizers seriously.
This cheesy kale and spinach dip is my vegan take on classic spinach and artichoke dip, which is typicallyladen with cheese – my former love.
But since we’ve broken up, I’ve replaced the cheese-shaped hole in my heart with cashew cream and vegan parmesanand haven’t looked back. Who needs the real thing when the substitutes are healthier and taste amazing? That’s what I say. 
This dip requires just 9 ingredients – hooray! And it comes together in about 30 minutes (once your cashews are soaked).
Plus, it hasall my loves:
kale
spinach
cashew cream
garlic
vegan parmesan
All that’s missing is a toasty baguette for scooping. Don’t worry – we’ll get to that.

Once you’ve mixed your ingredients together it just takes a quick bake in the oven to get it piping hot and ready for serving.
I preferred a toasted baguette, but you could also serve it with veggies, tortilla chips, or any other crackers of choice.

This dip is amazing! It’s
Creamy
Savory
Cheesy
Hearty
Satisfying
Loaded with greens
Super healthy
Simple
Shareable
&amp; Perfect for holiday parties

If you make this dip, we hope you love it! As always, share a picture on Instagram with the #minimalistbaker if you do! We’d love to see this dip in action.
Cheers!

","If you haven’t soaked your cashews yet, do so the night before in room temperature water, or 1 hour before in very hot water. Drain thoroughly.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease a small, oven-safe serving dish (see photo for size reference).Add soaked and drained cashews to a blender with almond milk and puree into a cream. Add 1/4 cup nutritional yeast and 3/4 tsp sea salt (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and mix once more. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You want it pretty cheesy and well-salted, so I added the full 6 Tbsp nutritional yeast (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Set aside.In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté garlic in 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and then add spinach and kale. Season with a healthy pinch (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) of sea salt and black pepper and cook for 5 minutes or until wilted, then remove from heat.Add 3/4 of the cashew cream (see photo) and toss to combine. If it can take more, add it in. Otherwise, reserve the rest for pasta or other uses. Add 2 Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese for additional texture/flavor and stir.Add to prepared baking dish and top with remaining vegan parmesan.Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until warmed through and sightly browned on top.Before serving, top with additional vegan parmesan cheese if desired. Other add-ons might include red pepper flake or hemp seeds.Serve with assorted vegetables, tortilla chips, crackers, or toasted baguette. Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh."

","Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C) and butter two round cake pans, or an 8x8 baking dish (as original recipe is written // adjust number or size of pans if altering batch size). Add flour to coat, then shake out excess and set aside.In a large mixing bowl, prepare flax eggs by mixing flaxseed and water and let rest.Core apples (no need to peel) and grate. I recommend a mix of finely grated, and coarsely grated. Place grated apple on a clean dish towel and gently squeeze to remove about half of the juice. Set aside. (P.S. you should totally drink that apple juice.)To the flax egg, add sugars, molasses, oil, vanilla, almond milk, grated apples, and whisk.Set a sifter over something to catch fall out and add dry ingredients in this order: 1 cup whole wheat flour (amount as original recipe is written // use 2/3 of the total if altering batch size), baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, cinnamon, remaining 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (amount as original recipe is written // use remaining 1/3 of the total if altering batch size). Stir gently with a spoon, then sift over wet ingredients and stir to combine, being careful not to over mix).Lastly, add oats and stir again to combine, being careful not to over mix. The batter should be thick but pourable. If it appears too thick, add a bit more almond milk to thin and stir.Pour batter into prepared cake pan(s). If you're dividing between two pans, it may look like there’s not enough batter but there is! Spread it in an even layer and it will rise while baking.Bake for about 30-35 minutes if using 2 round cake pans or about 40-50 minutes for an 8x8. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean and the edges should be visibly browned. Remove from oven and set out on counter to cool completely.While the cake is cooling, prepare frosting. To the same mixing bowl (rinsed clean), add softened cream cheese, softened butter and beat or whisk vigorously to combine. Then add powdered sugar in 1/2 cup increments until thick and spreadable.Add flour at the end to thicken (optional - or just more powdered sugar). You want this frosting to be pretty thick so it won’t slide off the cake, so keep adding flour and/or powdered sugar until it reaches the right consistency.Once the cake is completely cooled, add 1/3 of the frosting to the top of the bottom layer and spread into an even layer. Then add the top layer of cake and frost generously with remaining frosting, coating sides last.

582,Vegan Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Sugar Cookies

I’m not a negative person, but I do oftenexpect the worst in order to safeguard myself from less than ideal outcomes.
For example, say we’re planning to hangout with friends. Ithink, “This maygo terribly wrong. I’ll say something stupid. I’ll spillwine on their couch. There will be lots of awkward silence.They’ll never invite us over again.”
That way, if the evening goes at all OK, it was way better than I expected! Success! It’s like some twisted way of guaranteeinga “successful outcome” in any circumstance. Aren’t I smart? (Cheekygrin.)
Does anyone else do this? Because it kind of makes me feel like some bizarre form of a control freak and I need some more people in thisboat with me. Either that or send 18 dozen of these sugar cookies to help me cope, STAT.

While I’m not able to predict many (read: any) things that will happen in life, I can predict this: Make these cookies and you will fall in love.
They are the classic, quintessential sugar cookie all veganized and tender and perfect, just dying to be frosted and brought to all of your holiday gatherings. Your friends and family will forget all about the gifts and nose dive into these bad boys, guaranteed.

These cookies are simple, as always. Just 1 bowl and no fancy methods or equipment required. Just good old fashioned cookies at your fingertips in less than 1 hour.

And when it comes time to frost, get festive – naturally!
I tried my hand at DIY natural food coloring using beet juice and it worked beautifully! Look at that hot pink like WHOA.
I also tried parsley for “green” but itwas less successful. Hasanyone else tried beets or other foods for dying? Do share. I’d love to know.

As far as the cookies go, you can cut them into shapes or just roll them into balls that bake into perfect,beautiful, fluffy discs. I want them all.
The shapes are a little more time intensive,but definitely worthit if you really want to get into the holiday spirit. But let’s be real, when it comes time to pick which cookie(s) to eat, we choosebased on size and amount of frosting (the more of both, the better).

You’re going to LOVE these cookies. They’re:
Perfectlytender
Simple to make
Not too sweet
Vanilla-infused
Amazing with frosting
&amp; Undetectably vegan
These cookies are definitely my new go-to for holiday gifting.

583,Simple Tofu Quiche | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Tofu Quiche

The first time I tried tofu my friend baked a block for me, slathered in BBQ sauce and called it dinner. I’m a champ so I stomached it, but I pretty much vowed to never eat the stuff again.
Obviously, my opinions have since changed.

Iwould consider myself a quiche fan, but certainly not an aficionado. But I wanted to give a tofu version a try.
After mastering tofu in stir fries, peanut sauce, and spring rolls, a quiche seemed like the next step in my tofu journey. And I’m happy to report my experiment was a success; you could say I’ma total tofu quiche convert (it’s what all the hipsters are doing).

This quiche is simple! So even if you’ve never attempted a quiche before, I have faith that you can nailthis version.
It requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods even the novice cook can master.
For starters, the crust is just hash browns (making the whole thing naturally gluten-free)! And the filling is loaded with roasted veggies (any you have on hand), and a mixture of silken tofu, hummus and nutritional yeastto give it thatperfect “egg-like” flavor and texture.

For those skeptics out there saying, “Yeah, but what does it taste like?” I say, (Rhonda,) it tastes amazing! Seriously, it’s:
Savory
Satisfying
Comforting
Loaded with veggies
Healthy
Crispy on the crust
Egg-like in the center
&amp; Convincingly close to the real thing

How is December treatingyou all thus far? Well I hope.
We’resettled into our new place in Portland (I’ll be sure to post pictures on Instagram soon!), and getting back into our groove. It’s always amazing to me how much a move can disrupt life. A two-week breakbecomesa month and before I realize it, I haven’t properlyexercisedin weeks, reach for takeout at every turn, and my email is overflowing. It’s moments like these when I realize I’m more of a control freak than I’d like to admit. My schedule is seriously importantto me.
Thankfully, I’m feeling a bit more “normal” now, whatever that means in this season of life. We even have our Christmas tree up and I’m feeling quite festive with my“Indie Holidays” station blaring in the background as I work.
Of course, a new space has required some reorganization as wellas a few new purchases(for home, office and otherwise), and in the process we’ve managed to simplify and streamline a bit more (which we love).
I’m planning to createa “Simple Kitchen” post soon to highlight everything we own in our “minimalist” kitchen to show you just how possible it is to do more with less stuff.
Until then, let’s eat pie, shall we?

Have you guys tried our Vegan PB&amp;J Pie yet? It’s one of my favorites.
In the process of making it I discovered the magic of date paste and coconut whipped cream mixed together to create a thick, custard-like mousse, perfect for pies and even no-churn ice cream! Since then I’ve been dyingto try it in another variation.
Enter: Chocolate Peanut Butter.

This magic starts with coconut whipped cream and date paste. Then a generous amount of melted dark chocolate and a giant heap of salted creamy peanut butter.
Hubba, hubba indeed.
The result is a rich, thick chocolate mousse infused with salty peanut butter piled into perfectly salty-sweet graham cracker crust – literally the pie of my dreams.

This pie is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and easy-to-follow methods.
If you can master date paste (pitted dates whirled into a paste) and coconut whipped cream (chilled coconut cream whipped into an airy mousse), then you can totally make this pie. And, I highly recommend doing sobecause it’s bomb. Yes, I still say bomb (Rhonda). Deal with it.

This pie is my new favorite. It’s:
Creamy
Thick
Rich
Chilled
Super chocolaty
Infused with peanut butter
Perfectly sweet
Nestledin a graham cracker crust
Delectable
Satisfying
&amp; Perfect for holiday gatherings and beyond
One bite into this bad boy and I was done for. I took two slices and shared the rest with a friend, who later reported sheate three slices in two days. That’s when you know it’s good – you can’t keep your hands off it.

If you make this pie, please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram, @minimalistbaker on Twitter, or leave a comment. We seriously love seeing what you guys cook up.
Happy holiday baking season, friends! There’s much more sweet (and savory) goodness to come in the next few weeks. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and place a large mixing bowl in the freezer to chill.In a separate small mixing bowl, melt chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool slightly.For crust, add graham crackers to a food processor (or a bag and use a rolling pin to crush) and mix into a fine meal. Add salt and melted butter and pulse to combine.Press firmly into a standard 9 or 9.5 inch (or slightly smaller // as original recipe is written // adjust size or number of pans if altering batch size) pie dish and use your fingers to press it up the sides. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until fragrant and lightly browned. Set aside to cool.To prepare the filling, scoop out chilled coconut cream, leaving behind any liquid in the bottom of the can, and place in your pre-chilled large mixing bowl. Use a mixer to beat until creamy.Next, add date paste and mix once more. If you haven't made your date paste yet, simply add sticky, pitted dates to a food processor and process until creamy, adding a little hot water to combine if needed. If your dates were a little dry, soak in warm water for 10 minutes, then drain.Next add slightly cooled melted chocolate and mix once more to combine. Lastly, add peanut butter and mix again.Transfer filling to cooled crust and loosely cover with plastic wrap to set in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, ideally overnight.To serve, slice and gently plate. Top with coconut whipped cream, additional peanut butter, crushed roasted peanuts and/or dairy-free chocolate shavings (optional).Store leftovers in the fridge for up to a few days. Cover well and freeze after that for an “icebox” pie."
585,Gingerbread Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gingerbread Granola

It’s about that time again; time for all-things gingerbread and peppermint and my beloved Indie Holidaysstation. I simply love this time of year, especially the baking and aromas that come with it.
Gingerbread is certainly one of my favorite holiday cookies, so when a reader requested my takeon gingerbread granola, I couldn’t resist.

Since testing this first batch I’ve nearly gobbled it all up and am preparing to whip up round 2. This stuff is that good.
You guys know I have a thing for granola, and this flavor is a variation of my original recipe.
It gets its gingerbread flavor from the spices and molasses. Ginger, cinnamon and cloves give it depth, spice and warmth, while molasses adds a touch ofsweetness with deep amber notes. I think I’m in love.


As always, this recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutes from start to finish. And it’s customizable!You can use whatever nuts you have on hand really. I went with a mix of almonds, pecans and walnuts – my favorite.
I think the only thing missing – and believe me, I was tempted to add it in – is a bunch of crumbled up Vegan Gluten Free Gingerbread Men. I don’t know how I resisted, but it would make this granola practically perfection in a bowl.

You guys are going to L-O-V-E this granola. It’s
Sweet
Crunchy
Gingerbread-spiced
Festive
Perfectlycrisp
Nutty
Wholesome
Simple
Nutritious
&amp; Filling
If you give this recipe a try, let us know on Twitter, Instagram(#minimalistbaker),or Facebook. We certainly plan to make this granola many times winter and hope you will, too. Cheers and happy holiday baking!

","Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 C).Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.In a small saucepan over medium low heat, warm the coconut oil, maple syrup, molasses and vanilla extract. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix well.Spread the mixture evenly onto a a large baking sheet and bake for 18–22 minutes, stirring near the halfway point to ensure even cooking. The coconut oil will help this granola crisp up nicely, but be sure to watch it carefully as it browns quickly.Once the granola is visibly browned (about 19 minutes for me), remove from the oven and let cool completely on the pan before storing.Keep in a container that has an air-tight seal and it should keep for a few weeks."

Welcome to December. Kind of crazy isn’t it? 2014 is almostover. I still haven’t quite grappled with it all.
But nonetheless, here we are smack dab in the middle of the holiday season and I’m feeling kind of cozy.
Though I normally crave warmer thingsin colder months, this smoothie makes a shining exception with its rich orange hue, creamy texture and warm, spicy notes. I think I’ve learned to love sweet potato in a whole new way.

I absolutely adore sweet potatoes for breakfast in these oats, for lunch in this salad, and for dinner withroasted chickpeas and garlic sauce.
You really can’t go wrong with their exceptional nutritional content, boasting plenty ofbeta carotene and both Vitamin A and C (great for immunity).Not to mention, one potatoprovides roughly4 grams protein, 6 grams of fiber, and just 162 calories.

This smoothie also containscinnamon, ginger and turmeric, all of whichact as anti-inflammatory agents in the body, among many other benefits.
This combination also adds a warm, spicy undertone that complementsthe sweetness of the sweet potato perfectly.
Last but not least, orange juice addsplenty of Vitamin C and extra immune-boosting benefits to hep ward off any stubborn colds this winter.
I think you’re going to love this smoothie. It’s:
Creamy
Refreshing
Perfectly sweet
Subtly spiced
Gingery
Nutrient-rich
&amp; Seriously delicious
This smoothie is perfect for days when you want something healthy, filling, and a little sweet. Plus, it’s simple with less than 10 ingredients. That’s my kind of breakfast.

587,Whole-Grain Vegan Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Whole-Grain Vegan Pancakes

Picture this: It’s morning. Your family is still asleep and you have the kitchen, a pot of coffee, and a good book to yourself.
Your in-laws are here for the holidays, or maybe friends from out of town. You want to impress them! But God forbid they see you pull out a box mix of pancakes (even though we all do in a pinch).
I have just the solution.

These homemade, simple, whole grain vegan pancakes are just what you and your family need.
Good news! They come together in 20minutes, 1 bowl,completely from scratch! You will be the breakfasthero after all.
These pancakes are wholesome thanks to a mix of rolled oats, whole wheat flour, and spelt flour!
Spelt flour is new to my kitchen but has been around for centuries. It’s an ancient grain that has a slightly nutty, sweet flavor. It’s also easy to digest and higher in protein than whole wheat flour, making it ideal for these pancakes as well asmany other baked goods where traditional flours are used.
These cakes are also naturally sweetened with maple syrup, and olive oil keeps them both moist and heart healthy. Hello healthy breakfast.

Beyond being healthy, they also taste amazing! They’re:
Fluffy
Wholesome
Tender
Slightly nutty
Perfectly sweet
Hearty
Satisfying
Simple
Fast
&amp; Perfect for the whole family
I figured for the holidays when heavy meals are on the horizon, it’s great to start out the day with something filling but nutritious. A couple of these along with a green smoothie would certainly do the trick!

If you make these pancakes, be sure to let us know! Leave a comment or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. We love seeing our creations in your kitchens.
Or, Pinit to save for later! I personally love keeping a Pancake board for when the mood strikes (you know, Monday, Wednesday, Friday and most Saturdays). Cheers!

","To a large mixing bowl, add flaxseed and water and let set for a minute or two. Then add oil, maple syrup, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine. Add almond milk and whisk again until well combined.Next add oats, whole wheat flour, and spelt flour and stir until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Let batter rest for 10 minutes while you preheat your cooking surface.Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 325 degrees F / 162 C), or a large skillet on the stove stop. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot – oil shouldn’t smoke when it makes contact with the surface.Lightly grease your griddle with oil of choice and pour 1/4 cup measurements of the batter onto the griddle. There should be 6 pancakes (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). (If your batter looks too thick, thin it with a little more almond milk.) Flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges turn slightly dry, being careful not to burn.Cook for 1-2 minutes more on the other side and then top with vegan butter or peanut butter and a drizzle of maple syrup, or whatever else you please. Compote would also be delicious.Will reheat well the next day in the microwave. Otherwise, freeze cooked pancakes in a single layer on a baking sheet and package in a freezer-safe container or plastic bag. Reheat in the toaster, oven (at 350 F / 176 C), or microwave (for 30 seconds - 1 minute)."
588,Vegan Dinner Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Dinner Rolls

Enough teasing. It’s time to share these perfect, fluffy vegan dinner rolls with you guys. Thanksgiving can officially arrive any time now.

I’ve always been a sides kind of girl to be honest. The main dishes are great and all but green bean casserole? Dinner rolls? Mashed potatoes? Yep, that’s where I’m at.
It’s been that way ever since I wasa kid. I guess that means I never grew up? Eh, I don’t care much as long as I can havetwo or three of these rolls to myself come dinner time.
If you’ve ever been intimidated by the idea of making rolls from scratch, don’t be! It’s a really simple process, especially this recipe.
These rolls require just 7 basic ingredients and very easy-to-follow methods. Nothing complicated or exhausting here. You know that’s notour game.

Despite being ridiculously simple, these rolls deliver big time in flavor and texture.
They’re fluffy, buttery, and perfectly tender, just begging to be slathered in some vegan butter and jam. (Don’t act like you’re above butter and jam on a biscuit, Rhonda. You’re not fooling anyone.)

Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until fluffy and light golden brown.For best results, serve immediately as is, or with vegan butter and jam of choice, such as Orange Thyme. Alternatively, store them loosely covered with a kitchen towel for up to 3 days on the counter. For freezing, we recommend freezing pre-baked, then when ready to prepare, let them thaw, rise, and bake."
589,Simple Fall Slaw | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Fall Slaw

Can I tell you guys a secret? We’re moving to Portland. Like, this weekend.
I know. We’re nomads. Get used to it.

If you’ve followed Minimalist Baker for any length of time, I suspect you’ve had a hard time placing a finger on where exactly we are at any giventime. We were married in Kansas, moved to Oregon, moved back to Kansas, now Missouri, and now back to Oregon.
Whoof. I would be confused, too.
But you know what? That’s OK. Life ebbs and flows and interests swell and dwindle and we as people change. It’s no wonder our addresses change, too.
Since leaving Portland in 2011, we’ve missed it dearly. A few vacations back confirmed that fact. So we’re packing up and heading west (again). And we’re kind of excited about it.
This change doesn’t meanmuch for you guys! (I think we’ll still have Internet in Portland, wink wink). It just means we’ll be in a new place (follow John and me on Instagram to watchour transition), inspired by new surroundings, doing new things. Among the many, many things I’m grateful for this Thanksgiving season, that is certainly one of them.


Enough talk about moving, and more talk about this amazing slaw.
It’s loaded with fruits and vegetables in just about every shape and texture, and topped with a seriously delicious tahini-apple cider vinegar dressing that brings the whole thing together. Unsalted sunflower seeds pack extra nutritional punch and plenty of protein.
I think I’m in love.
Also? 30 minutesis all you need to make this holiday-worthy dish.

What does it taste like? If crisp Autumn weatherhad a taste, this would be it. It’s:
Crisp
Fresh
Flavorful
Loaded with veggies and fruit
Tossed in a simple, tangy dressing
Simple
Satisfying
&amp; Perfect for holiday gatherings
What’s even better about this dish is you can make it a day or so in advance and it just keeps getting better as the flavors meld together. That’s my kind of recipe.
As always, if you give this recipe a try let us know! Take a photo and tag it#minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see your beautifulslawthis holiday season. Cheers!

","Prepare all veggies and add to a bowl. I used this mandolin and it went so fast! Otherwise, a sharp knife and some patience, or a food processor with a grating attachment would work brilliantly.Whisk dressing ingredients in a small mixing bowl and taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Add dressing to veggies, along with sunflower seeds, and toss to coat. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving, preferably 2-3 hours or up to overnight.Store in the fridge covered for a few days, though best within the first 24-48 hours."
590,Simple Vegan Stuffing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Stuffing

If you haven’t been able to tell yet, I’m trying to load you guys up with some awesome vegan options for Thanksgiving, Christmas and beyond. I know it can be difficult to know where to start when it comes to adapting family recipes to suit everyone’s dietary needs, solet us help!
This year I’m sharinglots of savory options, not just the sweet stuff! (Even though you guys know I love a good pie or two. Or three.)
Expect a full Thanksgiving roundup next week. But until then, let’s talk about this stuffing, which happens to be my favorite stuffing of all time.

This recipeis adapted from my grandma’s classic stuffing that my dad has loved since he was a kid, and I happen to be quite fond of as well. It’s hearty, moist and flavorful on the inside, and perfectly crisp on the outside – just like any good stuffing should be.

While her version isn’t vegan, I’ve subbed out the meat for lentils, the egg for a flax egg, and the chicken broth forveggie broth to keep things veg-friendly. (Of course, sub in any of those things as you please.)
Despite making quite a few swaps, the final result was surprisingly close to the original recipe! In fact, I think if I served thisversion at Thanksgiving, I doubt anyone would be able to tell the difference.
Another perk? It’s simple! Just 9 ingredients – all basic and easy to get your hands on.

This stuffing is my new favorite! It’s:
Hearty
Warm
Flavorful
Loaded with veggies
Studded with nutrient-rich lentils
Wholesome
Satisfying
Moist on the inside
Crisp on the outside
&amp; Perfect for holiday gatherings

","The night before, cube your bread and set it in a large bowl to dry out - you want it to be the texture of day old bread - noticeably dry but not rock hard.The day of, if you haven’t already cooked your lentils, do so now by thoroughly rinsing 3/4 cup lentils in cold water, then adding to a small saucepan with 1 1/2 cups veggie broth or water (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Cook over medium-high heat until a low boil is achieved, and then lower to a simmer and continue cooking uncovered for 20-30 minutes. Set aside.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a 9x13 pan (or comparable sized dish // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) with foil or spray with nonstick spray. Also prepare flax egg and set aside.Sauté onion and celery in the olive oil or vegan butter and season with a bit of salt and pepper. Cook until fragrant and translucent - about 5 minutes. Set aside.To the bowl of bread, pour most of the broth then add the remaining ingredients (sage, cooked veggies, flax egg, and lentils) and mix with a wooden spoon. The key is to make sure it is about the consistency of a meatloaf. If it’s too dry, add more broth and mix again. If it’s gotten too wet, add more bread.Transfer to the prepared pan and cover with foil. Bake for 45 minutes. Then remove the top layer of foil so the top can brown. Increase heat to 400 degrees F (204 C) and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until the top is well browned and crisp.Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving. Leftovers reheat well in the microwave or oven, though best when fresh.This dish would be awesome with vegan mashed potatoes and my vegan mushroom gravy!"
591,Vegan Pumpkin Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Swirl Cheesecake

I once ran a half marathon then promptly headed to the Cheesecake Factory to order a fat slice of white chocolate macadamia cheesecake. It was apparently so worth it I did the exact same thing the followingyear.
Though I haven’t runa race since then, I still crave cheesecake immensely. So rich, sweet, and like custard and cake in one. What’s not to love? But my dairy days are long behind me so I set out to vegan-ize this bad boy. Mission seriously accomplished.

This recipe starts with a 2-ingredient graham cracker crust (my personal favorite crust). But tokeep it gluten free, try my Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Menfor a slightly spicier deep, amber flavor. You really can’t lose either way.
While thecrust is baking, prepare the two fillings in a blender and then swirl away. Onehour in the oven and this gorgeous pie is transformedinto aseriously legit vegan cheesecake. Jaws will drop – trust me on this one.
This pie is ridiculously close to actual cheesecake. It’s:
Creamy
Smooth
Custardy
Pumpkin-infused
Subtly spiced
Perfectly sweet
Seriously decadent
&amp; Kind of amazing
I too was skeptical of whether or not a baked vegan cheesecake was a) possible, and b) capable of topping the glory that is 7 ingredient no-bake cheesecake. Turns out, yes to both (even though these little gems will always have a place in my heart).

While thispie would make the perfect Thanksgivingdessert alongsideour classic Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Pie, I think it would be perfect year-round. With a few creative substitutions, I even think pumpkin could be substitutedfor other flavors (like blueberry or peanut butter!), and still be amazing. Yes, experimenting will ensue. Don’t you worry.
If you guys make this recipe, we’d love to know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! Happy holiday baking, friends. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add graham crackers to food processor and mix until a fine meal is achieved (alternatively, smash with a rolling pin in a large freezer bag). Add melted butter and pulse to combine.Transfer to a standard pie pan (mine is 9.5 inches, but 9 inches or slightly smaller will work // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and press with fingers to form the crust evenly on the bottom and up the sides of the pan. If any surface area of the pan isn’t covered with crust, spritz it with non-stick spray so the cheesecake won’t stick.Bake for 10-12 minutes or until slightly browned. Then set aside to cool. Keep oven at 350 F.In the meantime, prepare cheesecake filling by adding all ingredients to a blender and blending until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings/sweetness as needed. Transfer to a mixing bowl and set aside.Add in pumpkin swirl ingredients and blend, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings/flavors as needed.First, pour cheesecake filling into pre-baked crust, then dollop with pumpkin filling and use a knife or toothpick to swirl (I used a chopstick). Set on a baking sheet.Bake for 1 hour - 1 hour 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the center should be slightly jiggly.Let cool completely. Then loosely cover with a paper towel (to catch moisture) and then very loosely with foil and chill for at least 6 hours or overnight before serving.To serve, gently slice and top with coconut whipped cream, crumbled gingersnaps, and/or extra pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon.If you’re feeling extra decadent, this would be amazing with my Vegan Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream. Will keep stored in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh."
592,Vegan Shepherd's Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Hour Vegan Shepherd’s Pie

There is something very wintry, very comforting about Shepherd’s Pie.
Hearty vegetables in a brothy sauce topped with fluffy mashed potatoes, all baked to bubbly perfectly. It’s kind of what Thanksgiving dreams are made of, at least in my world.

My family wasn’t big on casseroles growing up and Johnand I aren’tbig on them now, but this recipe may be ouroneexception.
Traditional Shepherd’s pie contains ground beef, which I considered swapping for walnuts, a combination of mushrooms and walnuts, or lentils.
Being that lentils seemed to packthe most nutritional punch and protein, I went that route! Plus, they cook up nicely while your potatoes are boiling, making the whole process rather seamless.

Lentils are a plant-based powerhouse. Not only are they affordable and easy to cook, they’re also high in essential nutrients like fiber, iron and protein (9 grams per 1/2 cup serving).
They also absorb flavors well and can be added in place of ground beef in just about any recipe. That’s great news if you ask me!


This recipe is not only nutritious, tasty and filling, it’s also simple!
Just 9 ingredients required and about 1 hour from start to finish. I could see this not only being a vegetarian-friendly Thanksgiving entree, but an easy weeknight meal for colder months ahead.
So, what does it taste like? I’m glad you asked. It’s:
Hearty
Filling
Savory
Loaded with veggies
Herb-infused
Warm
Comforting
&amp; Seriously satisfying
I cooked this up and John and I both gladly ate two servings for dinner. We’re not even really “casserole” people, but we both loved the flavor, consistency and simple nature of this dish.
This will definitely become a staple for us in the winter months ahead.

We hope you guys love this recipe! If you give it a try, be sure to let us know in the comments, or by tagging a photo#minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see.
Cheers, friends!

For some reason, eggplant used to intimidate me. Its floppy texture, neutral taste, andseemingly over-involvedcooking methods made me think it would be something I’d never master.
I was wrong.

Since getting my hands on my first eggplant last year, it’s become one of my absolute favorite fruits (yes, fruit, even though it’s a vegetable in my book).
Twoof my absolute favorite recipes utilizing eggplant have been my Cashew-less Vegan Queso and my Eggplantand Caramelized Onion Dip. It’s neutral flavor help it absorb flavors extremely well, and depending on how you cook it, its texture is extremely versatile – from super creamy to super crisp.
And in this little gem of a recipe, it’s crispy to the max.

This recipe was inspired by one ofmy favorite food bloggers, Izy from Top with Cinnamon. It’s straight out of her beautiful new cookbook, Top With Cinnamon.
Although it’s not a vegan cookbook, it has a lot of recipes that can be easily adapted to a vegan diet. And when I laid my eyes on hercrispy aubergine pesto pasta, I knew it was the one for me.

This recipe took a few tries to get just right sans egg, but I think I’ve done it (simply)!
It requires just 10 ingredients,employs easymethods, and takes a little more than 1hour from start to finish. It is a little bit more involved than some savory meals I’ve cooked, but it’s one that John and I both love and crave, so it’s worth the extra timeand effort!

I think you guys are going to LOVE this recipe! It’s:
Comforting
Crispy
Warm
Rich
Flavorful
Saucy
Delicious
Satisfying
&amp; Simple!
I knew this recipe was a winner when I served it to John and he literally went back for seconds before I could! I love it when happy meal discoverieslike that happen.
If you give this recipe a try, I hope you love it as much as we did! As always, tag us on Instagram with #minimalistbaker or Twitter @minimalistbaker if you do. Cheers!

","Slice eggplant into thin rounds slightly less than 1/2 inch thick, and sprinkle each side liberally with sea salt. Arrange in a circular pattern in a colander and place in the sink to draw out the bitter taste of the eggplant.Let rest for 15 minutes, then rinse and arrange on a clean absorbent kitchen towel. Top with another clean dish towel and lay a baking sheet on top. Place something heavy on top, such as a cast iron skillet, to thoroughly dry for at least 10 minutes.In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with foil and spritz with nonstick spray. Also, if making pasta, bring water to a boil in a large saucepan.Prepare your dipping stations by placing almond milk + cornstarch in one bowl; flour in another bowl; and bread crumbs + sea salt + oregano + vegan parmesan (or nutritional yeast) in another bowl.Once thoroughly dry, dip eggplant slices in flour, then almond milk mixture, then breadcrumbs. Arrange on the baking sheet and pop in oven to bake for a total of 20-30 minutes.IMPORTANT STEP: While the eggplant is in the oven, bring a large skillet to medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp olive oil (or sub avocado oil // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and pull 3-4 eggplant rounds out of the oven at a time and sauté to give them extra crisp and texture. Cook for ~2 minutes on each side (or browned) and then return to oven to continue crisping. Do this in batches until all rounds are browned.While eggplant is browning in the oven, prepare marinara. I prefer adding my tomato sauce and spices to a serving bowl and microwaving to warm, but you could also heat it on the stove. Set aside.Once done cooking, drain pasta and cover with a towel to keep warm. Set aside.To serve: Plate pasta and eggplant slices and marinara in a dish as a dipping sauce. Additional vegan parmesan cheese makes an excellent topper.Leftovers don’t really reheat well, so it’s best when fresh. See notes for additional tips on crispy eggplant!"

Vegan
Gluten-Free
Perfect
Let’s do this.
This is the second post brought to you in partnership with Bob’s Red Mill!I have been anxiously awaiting the opportunity share with you guys about their new gluten-free flour blend. While their first blend was made with bean flours, this new blend is bean-free, delicious,andextremely versatile!
As you can see, itmakes an amazing, crisp, flavorful gluten-free pie crust totally possible! Major win in my book.
This pie requires just 10 ingredients, including the crust! And you guys may or not believe me, but you’d never ever,ever guess it was vegan or gluten-free. Seriously!
Trust me. Serve this at Thanksgivingand watch asyour guests mutter nothingbut “mmmm’s” and “ooooohhhh yeeaaahhhh’s” aroundthe dinner table.

The filling is where it’s at. It’s:
Mega flavorful
Super pumpkin-y
Firm
Incrediblymoist
Perfectlysweet
Subtly spiced
&amp; Seriously PERFECT


Contrast the filling against the perfectly crisp crust and you literally have the ultimate pumpkin pie.
Serve this to all of your guests this Thanksgiving and become the hit of the party. I want to see a show of hands afterwards from everyone who tricked their skeptical aunt Sally into consuming upwards of 3 slices of this pie with nothing but praise.


If you DO try this pie, seriouslylet us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram (or pin it!) so we can see! We look atevery photo and it always makes our day to see what you guys are cooking up.
Cheers and happy baking this holiday season, friends!

","To prepare crust, add gluten-free flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Slice or dollop the cold butter in and work gently with a fork or pastry cutter to cut it in. Don’t overwork, just get it incorporated.Next add ice cold water a little at a time and use a wooden spoon to stir. Only add as much water as you need to help it come together.Once a loose dough is formed, transfer to a piece of plastic wrap and work gently with your hands to form a 1/2 inch thick disc. Wrap firmly and refrigerate for a minimum 30 minutes, up to 2 days. Just let it warm back up a little before using. You don’t want it too warm or it can get too soft to handle.Once your dough is chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and prepare pie filling.Add all pie ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Set aside.To roll out the crust, unwrap the disc and place it between two sizable layers of wax paper (plastic wrap will work OK, but is a little more difficult to work with). Use a rolling pin to gently roll it into the shape of your pie pan. If it cracks, don’t stress - you can reform it with your hands once you get it in the pan. But try and be gentle.To transfer the crust, remove the top layer of wax paper and gently lay the pie dish face down on top of the crust and use the support of the wax paper to quickly but carefully invert it. Don’t overthink it - just do it.Once you get the crust inverted, gently use your hands to form it into the pan, working the crust up along the sides. It can be a little tricky but it bakes beautifully, so it’s worth the effort! Just try not to overwork the dough in the process - it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to perfect the shape. Any holes or cracks can be mended with a little excess dough and the heat of your hand.TIP: I would advise against trying to be fancy and do any elaborate design with the crust, so just get the crust in, get a flat edge and go.Pour filling into pie crust and bake for 58-65 minutes. The crust should be light golden brown and the filling will still be just a bit jiggly and have some cracks on the top. Remove from oven and let cool completely before loosely covering and transferring to the refrigerator to fully set for 4-6 hours, preferably overnight.Slice and serve with coconut whipped cream and an additional sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or pumpkin pie spice (optional). This would also be amazing with my Vegan Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Pecans!"
595,Simple Vegan Falafel | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Falafel Burgers

I remember the first time I ever triedMediterranean food. I was in college working at a breakfast restaurant and my coworker kept telling meabout her favorite local restaurant that serveda killervegetarian appetizerplatter.
Up until thatpoint, I had literally never heard offalafel or pita and had yet to jump on thehummus bandwagon. It was all a mystery to me.
But that all changed one day afterwork when she convinced me to join her for lunch. One bite in and I was ruined. Since then Mediterraneanhas become oneof my absolute favorite cuisines. I practically have hummus pumpingthrough my veins at this point.

Though I have mastered the art of Vegan Gluten-FreeFalafel, I’ve been craving a falafel burger these days. There’s something so substantial about a burger, and the flavors of Mediterranean cuisine lend themselves perfectly to toppings and sauces galore.

This recipeis simple, requiringjust 7 ingredients. Plus,it’s seriously well spiced withinfusions from both garlic and cumin for a tangy, smoky flavor that I absolutely adore.
They’re also baked for a healthier touch, though I do prefergiving them a little sauté beforehand to formanextra crust on the outside. I’m kind of a texture snob.

These burgersare super versatile! Serve them on pita for a more traditional falafel feel, atop greens for a seriously substantial salad, or wrapped inchard for a naturally gluten-free option.
As for sauces, hummus makes a lovely touch! Otherwise, my go-to Garlic Dill sauce is magic. You really can’t go wrong.

I’m kind of smitten with these burgers. They’re:
Savory
Smoky
Garlicky
Crusty on the outside
Tender on the inside
Fresh
Simple
&amp; Seriously satisfying
I suspect even carnivores would dig this dish. It’s so hearty and substantial with nearly 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per burger! That’s a seriously satisfying and healthy meal even picky eaters will love.

I’ve been known to repurpose ice creams many different ways:Ice cream sandwiches, floats, dessert nachos, and cakes. So how could I possiblypass up the opportunity to make a milkshake? That’s what I thought!

One bite into my creamy, dreamy Vegan Pumpkin Pie Ice CreamandI knew it was destined for greater things.
So when I got an inviteto make a recipe forHow Sweet Eats‘virtual baby shower, I knew this was just the thing. Jessica likes all things over the top, flavorful and borderlinetrashy. (Don’t worry Jessica, I’ll drink your share of bourbon this time).
What makes this shake trashy, you ask? BOURBON, baby. Lotsa bourbon.

My first thought was to make an ice cream float using apple cider or pumpkin beer, but cider is too sweet and beer is not really my thing. So John suggested a milkshake using bourbon. BOOM. Million dollar idea. It makes thisshake SO tasty.
That’s why I keep thisguy around. Not to mention, where would I be without my part time hand model? Da-da-dang, look at those curves.

This milkshake is everything I hoped it would be:
Creamy

597,Vegan Pumpkin Caramels | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Caramels

You guys know I have a thing for date caramel. It makes wonderful things like truffles and No-Bake PB&amp;J Pies, and No-Churn Chocolate Ice Cream. Clearly, there is nothing it cannot do.
Exhibit D: Pumpkin Caramels!

These truffles are seriously simple! They require just 6 ingredients, are naturally sweetened, and are both vegan and gluten free.
They get a serious punch of pumpkin flavor from both pumpkin butter (or puree), and pumpkin pie spice, and the result is a decadent-but-healthy caramel rolled in roasted pumpkin seeds and sea salt. Serious yum.


If you’ve never tried date caramel,you must! Get your hands on some dates, whirl them in your food processor, add a little coconut oil (or water) until you get the creamiest,dreamiest paste that tastes seriously identicalto caramel.
In addition to rolling your date caramel in pumpkin seeds and eating itascaramel bites, date paste keeps for weeks in the fridge and is ideal for adding to oatmeal, smoothies, desserts, and practically anything you want to sweeten naturally. It’s practically magic in a jar for health nuts and the sugar conscious.


The concept for these caramels came to me one night just before drifting off to sleep, as so many of my ideas do. I muttered to John, “Don’t let me forget, pumpkin caramels with dates!” so it wouldn’t escape me.
I’m so glad I remembered andgave it a go. I’ve been snacking on these for the past couple of weeks. The best part? No guilt! Dates really do hold a special place in my food-loving heart.

You’re going to love these caramels. They’re:

599,Coconut Whipped Cream Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Coconut Whipped Cream

Perfect coconut whipped cream is at your fingertips with this step-by-step tutorial! Plus, we’ve recently updated the post with new information on what brands are best and which brands to avoid!

What is coconut whipped cream?
Coconut whipped cream is a dairy-free alternative to classic whipped cream, which is made with heavy whipping cream! For a dairy-free, vegan-friendly version, simply swap a good quality full fat coconut milk or coconut cream in its place and whip into soft peaks!
How is coconut whipped cream made?
Coconut whipped cream is made by:

Selecting a good quality brand of coconut milk or cream (see recommendations below)
Chilling can overnight in the refrigerator to harden (chilling in the freezer doesn’t work as well)
Scooping hardened coconut cream into a mixing bowl and leaving any clear liquid behind (reserve for smoothies, etc.)
Whipping with a hand mixer or stand mixer until light peaks form
Optionally sweetening with sifted powdered sugar or stevia to taste (liquid sweeteners can weigh it down


Best brands for coconut whipped cream?
We tested 9 brands and these are the results! Listed from best to worst:

Savoy Coconut Cream – 10/10 – firm on top, liquid on bottom, super fluffy / creamy when scooped out – guar free!
Nature’s Charm Coco Whipping Cream – 10/10 whipped nicely, used the whole can, subtly sweetened, so delicious.
Aroy-D – 10/10 – amazingly fluffy when scooped out – little liquid on the bottom. Whips like a dream – guar free!
365 Whole Foods Organic Coconut Milk – 9/10 – firm to scoop out, half liquid, not too grainy – blended perfectly, especially after adding some of the coconut water to the bowl.
Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk Classic – 8/10 – firm to scoop out, ⅓ liquid – whips up nicely, especially with the addition of a little coconut water from the can.
Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk Simple (guar free) – 6-10 – scooped a little grainy, but fluffy out of the can. ½ liquid. Whipped easily, with a few more chunks and slightly less creaminess than the “classic” counterpart
Field day Classic Unsweetened Coconut Milk- 7/10 – watery on top, hard at bottom, but creamy to scoop. Whipped well, a little less fluffy / creamy than the others.
Trader Joe’s Organic Coconut Cream – 5/10 – grainy / oily at first – grainy and didn’t whip well but wasn’t runny
Trader Joe’s Organic Coconut Milk – 3/10 – chunky and hard – half liquid – blended into bits but too firm to whip.


Tips for perfect coconut whipped cream

Select a good quality brand of coconut milk (see recommendations above).
Chill overnight, not in the freezer for best results.
Chilling overnight is key or the coconut cream won’t harden and will likely be too soft to whip.
Before whipping, chill a large mixing bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes!
If your coconut whipped cream is too stiff when whipping, add some of the reserved liquid from the can to help it blend smoother and create more air!
See clumps? Keep whipping and scraping down sides, and add some of the reserved liquid from the can to soften the mixture and create more air!
Use immediately, OR (our preferred) make ahead and chill for 4 hours + where it will firm up even more!
Keep it sugar free by adding a little stevia to taste!


NOTE: Post updated 3/21/19 with brand recommendations, tips for perfect coconut whipped cream every time, and more photos.
","Chill your coconut cream or coconut milk in the refrigerator overnight (see notes for top brands!), being sure not to shake or tip the can to encourage separation of the cream and liquid. See notes for more insight / troubleshooting.The next day, chill a large mixing bowl 10 minutes before whipping.Remove the coconut cream or milk from the fridge without tipping or shaking and remove the lid. Scrape out the top, thickened cream and leave the liquid behind (reserve for use in smoothies).Note: if your coconut milk didn't harden, you probably just got a dud can without the right fat content. In that case, you can try to salvage it with a bit of tapioca flour - 1 to 4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)- during the whipping process. That has worked for me several times.Place hardened cream in your chilled mixing bowl. Beat for 30 seconds with a mixer until creamy. Then add vanilla (optional) and powdered sugar (or stevia) and mix until creamy and smooth - about 1 minute. Taste and adjust sweetness as needed.Use immediately or refrigerate - it will harden and set in the fridge the longer it's chilled. Will keep for up to 1 - 2 weeks!Coconut whipped cream is perfect for topping desserts like pie, hot cocoa and ice cream. It's also ideal for french toast, pie fillings, mousse, and even no-churn ice cream!"

﻿
","Blend together and store in a secure container in a dry place (I prefer a large mason jar).This can be tricky because gluten free flours react differently in pretty much every recipe. But in general, use in place of all purpose or whole wheat flour in a 1:1 ratio. For extra binding (since there is no gluten) you can add a pinch of xanthan gum depending on the recipe, but I don't find it necessary.This blend has worked wonders in muffins, cakes, quick breads, gingerbread cookies, corn bread, waffles, crepes and many other recipes.I also have a Gluten Free Whole Grain Pancake Mix that works beautifully with an egg. And a Gluten Free Pizza Crust that utilizes a slight variation of this blend."

Pour mixture back into pot.Continue cooking over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes and taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Serve as is or with Kale-Sesame topping.For the Kale-Sesame topping: In a small skillet over medium heat, dry toast sesame seeds for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently until slightly golden brown. Be careful as they can burn quickly. Remove from pan and set aside.To the still hot pan, add olive oil and garlic and sauté until golden brown - about 2 minutes. Add kale and toss, then add a pinch of salt and cover to steam. Cook for another few minutes until kale is wilted and then add sesame seeds back in.

603,Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Pumpkin Bread (V + GF)

This bread has been a long time in the making.
I posted about it weeks ago on Instagram and have since tested it a few more times to perfect it. The first attempt yielded moist, flavorful bread that was a bit too crumbly. The second attempt seemed hopeful, but it failed to remedy that problem once again. Third time was a charm! I think I’ve nailed it.
So excited to share this simple 1-Bowl Vegan AND Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread with you guys!
It starts with the vegan miracle – flax eggs.
And then an additional natural binder: mashed banana. I’ve found that banana binds otherwise crumbly baked goods when they’re both vegan and gluten-free. Even though it’s the tiniest bit detectable in the overall flavor, the texture is spot on and the pumpkin and pie spices really shine through.
When you bake this up, two things happen:
1) Your house will smelllike pumpkin heaven.
2) Dancing will ensuewhen you peer inside the oven and seehow beautifully it rises and turns deep golden orange in color.
Huzzah! But you must, and I repeat, must, resist the urge to slice in right away. Let it cool completely before slicing or it can be a tad on the crumbly side.
Now the important part. What’s it taste like? AMAZING. It’s
Tender
Moist
Pumpkin-y
Perfectly sweet
Subtly spiced
Studded with pumpkin seeds
Light
Satisfying

Intestingthis recipe several times, I’ve eaten more pumpkin bread than any human should in one month. But, surprisingly, it was all so deliciousit didn’t wear on me one bit and I even struggledto give the last loaf away to friends. That’s how good this bread is!

This is the perfect bread to make for fall parties, Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving, pumpkin carving, or just to have on hand for a snack on chilly days. Picture this: You, chai latte, pumpkin bread, oversized sweater, stretchy pants, a book. HEAVEN.

I have no idea how I’ve never made pumpkin cinnamon rolls before, but after perfecting my original World’s Easiest and recently the 1-Bowl Banana Breadrolls, I could hardly wait to try my hand at a pumpkin version. I’m happy to report it was a serious win.

This recipeis the first in a series of posts in partnership withBob’s Red Mill. I have loved theirproducts for years, and when we moved to Portland in 2010 I was thrilledto learnBob’swas based there.

I made this batch and managed to do some serious damage before forfeitingthe rest to our apartment staff. A girl can only eat so many cinnamon rolls in a day. My personal limit is two for now, but I’d like to see an increasenext quarter (wink, wink).


These rolls are not overwhelmingly pumpkin – it’s a more subtle infusion that I just adore.
Another perk? The glaze is optional and customizable. I’ve included a coupleoptions below, but my personal favorite is a simple powdered sugar glaze as it suits the spiciness of the pumpkin flavorperfectly.

","DOUGH: In a large mixing bowl in the microwave (or in a small saucepan over medium heat), heat the almond milk and vegan butter in 30 second increments until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from microwave (or stovetop) and let cool to 110 degrees F (43 C), or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast. If warmed on the stovetop, transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl at this point.Sprinkle on yeast, sugar, and salt and let activate for 10 minutes. Then add cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice and stir. Let it set for a few minutes, then whisk in pumpkin purée.Next add in flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring as you go. The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball, adding flour as needed.Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with oil, and add your dough ball back in and roll it around to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes - 1 hour, or until doubled in size.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. FILLING: Brush with melted vegan butter and pumpkin butter, then add sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and the pecans.Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in a well-greased 8x8 square or comparable sized pan (you should have about 10 rolls as original recipe is written).TOPPING: Brush with vegan butter mixed with pumpkin butter, sprinkle with cane sugar and pecans, and cover with plastic wrap. Set on top of the oven to let rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Once the oven is hot, bake rolls on a center rack for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown and crusty on top. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.For a glaze, try my dairy-free cream cheese frosting or the simple glaze I share in the notes below. Add a Tbsp of pumpkin butter and/or a dash of pumpkin pie spice to add more pumpkin flavor.Cinnamon rolls should keep covered at room temp for up to a few days, though best when fresh. You can freeze at the stage where the dough is cut into cinnamon rolls and placed in a pan. Cover well and freeze in a pan, then let thaw for at least 6 hours before baking. Cover and set on top of the oven while preheating to help rise. Bake as instructed. "
605,Vegan Fall Pot Pies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Hour Fall Pot Pies

The weather has beenabsolutelycharming in the Midwest. En route to the grocery store Monday, I nearly pulledover to snap pictures of the neonred, orange, and yellow leaves creating a technicolor funnel over the street. Breathtaking.
I could goon and onabout fall. But instead, I’ll share this very fall-appropriate recipe that’s totally comforting and utilizes my new love,Pumpkin Sage Biscuits.

You guys loved these1-Hour Vegan Pot Pies so much I knew avariation was in order. These vary from the original in two ways:
1. The veggies scream fall: parsnips, carrots, potatoes, and kale. Yum.
2. They’re topped with these tender, savory Pumpkin Sage Biscuitsfor an earthy, autumnal twist.
These two changes make a slight but noticeable differencein flavor and color, while still maintaining that quintessential creaminess pot pies require. I think I’m in love.

What’s more? These little gems are simple, requiring just 10ingredients (plusthe biscuits) and 1 hour from start to finish. That’s my kind of (vegan) dinner.

What do they taste like? Fall perfection.They’re:
Warm
Comforting
Hearty
Savory
Infused with pumpkin and sage
Loaded with fall veggies
Simple
Quick
Satisfying
&amp; Shareable
John and I devoured these and enjoyed our extra biscuits on the side with vegan butter and maple syrup. That’s my idea of a perfect fall meal: Something savory and comforting followed by something sweet; always something sweet.

I hope you all enjoy these as much as the originals! Andif you do, be sure to let us know by leaving a commentor sharing it on Twitter, Instagram, or Pinterest. Thanks for following along and supporting what we do! We kind of love you guys. Happy fall!
","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C).Add olive oil to a large saucepan over medium heat. Then add onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt – stir. Cook until soft – about 7 minutes.Add the flour and stir with a whisk, then slowly whisk in the broth.Add almond milk (optional), potatoes, parsnips, carrots, and bay leaves and stir. Simmer until the mixture is thickened (about 10 minutes). If it still appears too thin, scoop out (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 1/2 cup of the broth and add 2-3 tsp more flour and whisk. Add back into the pot to thicken. Wait a few minutes and then repeat if necessary.While the sauce is thickening, prepare biscuits (if using). Cut out, leave unbaked, and set aside.Once the sauce is thickened, add the kale and cook for 3 minutes more. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper if desired.Discard the bay leaves and divide the mixture evenly between 5-6 lightly greased ramekins or an 8×8 baking dish (as original recipe is written // adjust number or size of dish(es) if altering batch size).Top with unbaked biscuits and brush the tops of the biscuits with melted vegan butter. Set your ramekins on a baking sheet to catch overflow and bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbly (about 14-18 minutes). Let cool slightly before serving.

Mmmm, biscuits. They’re kind of what dreams are made of, no?
Plump, flaky, steamyand just begging to be sandwichedwith butter and devoured alongside every holiday dish known to man. Things areabout to get serious.

Once I crackedthe code for the Best Damn Vegan Biscuit, I moved onto another favorite variation of mine: (Vegan) Cheddar Jalapeño. And since I can’t seem to keep my hands off pumpkin this month, I knew a savory fallversion had to happen next.

These biscuits are infused with both pumpkin puree and fresh sage, giving them an earthy, autumnal flavor I just adore.
Not to mention, they’re simple! Just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and no fancy methods required. Even if you’re a biscuit novice, I walk you through each step so you’ll finally taste sweet biscuit gloryonce and for all.
These biscuits are a dream. They’re:
Tender
Fluffy
Flaky
Warm
Savory
Subtly pumpkin-y
Infused with fresh sage
Perfect for fall
&amp; Begging to beshared
Are you planning an October gathering? Perhaps a Friendsgiving? These are the biscuits for you! I see these making an appearance at pumpkin carvings, fall parties and beyond.
And if you’re a little weary of sage, know that it’s subtle or you can simply leave it out! Alternatively, swap in butternut squash puree or even sweet potato puree for a sweeter take. They’re very customizable and seriously delicious.

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Measure almond milk in a large liquid measuring cup and add lemon juice. Let curdle 5 minutes. Then whisk in pumpkin puree.Mix flour(s), salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl.Add cold butter and use a pastry cutter or fork to combine until small pieces remain and it looks like wet sand. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm. Add chopped sage and mix once more.Using a wooden spoon, stir gently while pouring in the almond-pumpkin mixture 1/4 cup at a time. You may not need all of it. Stir until just slightly combined – it will be a little sticky, not too much.Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with a bit of flour and then very gently turn the dough over on itself a couple times – hardly kneading.Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible.Use a 1-inch thick dough cutter or a similar-shaped object with sharp edges (such as a small drinking glass) and push straight down through the dough, then slightly twist. Repeat and place biscuits on a baking sheet in two rows making sure they just touch – this will help them rise uniformly. Gently reform the dough and cut out one or two more biscuits – you should have 7-9 depending on the size of your cutter (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Brush the tops with a bit more melted non-dairy butter and gently press a small divot in the center using your thumb. This will also help them rise evenly, so the middle won’t form a dome.Bake for 13-17 minutes or until fluffy and golden brown. These take a little longer to bake than traditional biscuits because the pumpkin adds extra moisture.Serve immediately as is or with additional butter and/or maple syrup. Let remaining biscuits cool completely before storing them in an airtight container or bag. Will keep for up to a few days, though best when fresh."

What’s fall without a good seasonal sugar cookie? I’m glad you agree. Onto the dough!

These cookies were inspired by fall, first and foremost, but also by my 1-Bowl Vegan Funfetti Cupcakes!
I overfilled the muffin tins with batter on my first try and quickly realized that the overflow baked perfectly into a sugar cookie-type consistency! In that moment, I knew vegan sugar cookies were not far out of reach.

This recipe is easyand fast! Just 1 bowl, simple methods, and 1 hour start to finish (frosting and all). And they just so happen to taste like the sugar cookies of your youth, just without (real) butter, eggs, or milk. Huzzah!

And what would a sugar cookie be without frosting?
I’ve included a basic vegan buttercream recipe below that’s infused with pumpkin butter and fall spices. It makes the perfect addition to these fluffy gems and sends the pumpkin flavor over the top.

You’re going to love these cookies. They’re:

Man oh man. Friends, this is a vegan ice cream revelation.
Pumpkin and spice and everything nice rolled into creamy, dreamy 10-ingredient bliss. Let’s do this!

This recipe starts with a base of soaked cashews for extra creamy texture.
And to avoid any flavor clashes, I went withalmond milk and olive oil rather than my first love, coconut milk and coconut oil. This ensuresthe creaminess is still in tact, but the flavor of the pumpkin really shines through.

Other perks?
No chillingrequired pre-churning
Sweetened withmaple syrup &amp;brown sugar for a rich, deep amber flavor
Packed with realpumpkin puree
Speckledwithpumpkin pie spice &amp;ground cinnamon for extrawarmth
And it churns up beautifully. Just look at that!


This ice cream is the real deal. It’s
Creamy
Rich
Pumpkin-y
Not toosweet
Subtly spiced
Simple
Fast
&amp; Perfect for fall

This ice cream remindsme of thechilled pumpkin pie my family makesfor Thanksgiving. It’s perfectly sweet, loaded with creamy pumpkin puree, and subtly spiced. The combination of flavors and textures seriouslymelt in your mouth.
To take things to the next level, top your scoopwith someplump coconut whipped cream and brown sugarroasted pecans(recipe below!). It’s like the pumpkin pie sundae of your dreams.

","Set your churning bowl in the freezer the night before to chill. Soak your cashews the night before as well or for at least 4-6 hours before blending. Alternatively soak in boiling water for 1-2 hours (see notes).Once soaked, add well-drained cashews and remaining ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth - about 3-4 minutes, using the ""liquify"" or ""puree"" setting if you have the option to get it really creamy. Taste and adjust sweetness/flavors as needed.Add mixture to your chilled ice cream maker bowl and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions until thoroughly chilled - about 45 minutes. It should resemble thick soft serve.Transfer to a freezer-safe container, cover and freeze until hard - at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Will keep in the freezer for up to a week.Take out of the freezer and thaw for 30-40 minutes - or microwave (gasp!) for 15-20 seconds - before serving to soften. Serve with brown sugar roasted pecans (see next step) and coconut whipped cream for extra oomph.FOR THE PECANS: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and place pecans on a foil-lined baking sheet. Toast for about 8 minutes.In the meantime, melt butter in a small skillet or in the microwave and stir in brown sugar, sea salt, cinnamon and cayenne.Remove toasted pecans from oven and toss with butter and spice mixture. Spread back onto the baking sheet and toast for another 4-7 minutes or until fragrant and golden brown, being careful not to burn.Let cool completely. Store leftovers in a jar for up to 1 week."

Dramatic? Over the top? I think not (Rhonda).

After having such success with my 7 Ingredient World’s Easiest Vegan Cinnamon Rolls, I knew more experimenting was to be done.
You guys have been loving on my first recipe. It’s been one of our most popular to date! And because I love banana bread so much, this recipe was bound to happen sooner or later.

The banana bread infusion happensin two ways: 1) banana puree in the dough, and 2) banana slices and walnuts in the centers. The result is an amazingly moist, banana-bread like cinnamon roll just begging to be frosted (and that, we must do).
BONUS: This recipe is seriously simple! Just 1 bowl and 9 ingredients (10, including the glaze). Plus, there’s only one true rise and no fancy methods required. Just pure, easy, simplecinnamon roll goodness that takes about 2 hours total.
Thismeans you could wake up around 9, make these little gems, and be enjoying them by brunch. Huzzah!

610,Sweet Potato Pie Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Pie Oats

My family is more of the pumpkin pie kin. Sweet potatoes areleft for marshmallow-topped casseroles. No shame there.
Recently, I’ve been craving them all the time. For instance, ingranolaorburied undera mound of chickpeas, Mediterranean style.
But I’ve yet to thrust theminto the breakfast scene. And if there’s one nutrient-packed root veg that deserves the morning spotlight, it’s this guy.

Sweet potatoes are apowerhouse when it comes to nutrition.
They’re rich in beta carotene and vitamins A and C, and they act as an anti-inflammatory in the body. One large potatoprovides4 grams protein, 6 grams of fiber, and just 162 calories. So, indulge away my friends. Indulge away.


These oats require just 7 ingredients and about 30 minutes start to finish. And, if you bake (or microwave) your sweet potatoes ahead of time (like me!), it’ll go even faster and you’ll always have someon hand to add to your morning oats or a quicksoup.
Though I made this version with rolled oats, I includednotes for using steel cut oats as well. You can also find my other steel-cut oat recipe hereserved with brown sugar pears, as well as my favorite Creamy Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries.
So many oats, so little time.

To give this dish a more indulgent “sweet potato pie” feel, I topped it with my Pumpkin Maple Pecan Granola! But of course, it would be just as delicious with any granola and a few roasted or raw pecans or walnuts.

These oats scream fall. They’re:
Warm
Comforting
Perfectly sweet
Cinnamon-infused
Loaded with sweet potato flavor
Simple
Healthy
Creamy with a bit of crunchfrom the granola
&amp; Perfect for chilly fall mornings

","To roast your sweet potato, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 F) and cut sweet potato in half and lightly coat with olive oil. Place flesh side down on a foil lined baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until soft and tender. This will depend on your size of potato. (Alternatively, pierce a few times with a fork and microwave for 4-5 minutes until tender.)Once done, pull potatoes out of the oven and start your oats (see notes for steel cut directions). Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling add your oats and reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until the oats have absorbed most of the water - about 5 minutes - stirring frequently.In the meantime, mashed your sweet potato and measure out roughly 1/2 cup. Set aside.Once your oats are just about done cooking (~5 minute mark), stir in sweet potato puree, sweetener of choice, cinnamon and flax seed and stir to combine. Taste and adjust flavor/seasonings as desired. To thin, add a splash of non-dairy milk (such as almond).Divide oats between two serving bowls (as recipe is originally written) and sprinkle with Pumpkin Maple Pecan Granola (or roasted pecans). Add a drizzle of honey for more sweetness. Enjoy immediately. Best when fresh."
611,Simple Vegetarian Meatballs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Meatballs

When I was in college I lived in a shady apartment complex in Wichita. Thelaundry room was in a separate building, which meant I had to lugmy clothes back andforth in the rain or shine to ensure I didn’t run out of presentable clothing for work and school.
Society, why do you impose such harsh rules on us?
Well, that lasted about a month. Before long I was trucking it back to my dad’s house just 20 minutes away where he’d often cook me dinner while I was folding my socks.
(Just kidding. Who folds their socks? Ugh, Rhonda. You would.)



If your dad is anything like mine, he’s all about simple, hearty meals.
Spaghettiwas one of his specialties. A little pasta, a lotta sauce, and a considerable amount of meatiness.
In fact, one evening (whilst doing laundry), I had two platefuls then promptly passed out on his couch from sheer exhaustion. My father proceeded to fold all of my clothes for me and wake me up with a kiss on the forehead reminding me it was time to go home.
Aren’t dads the best? Mine is.

I still love spaghetti and crave it almost weekly.
And thegood news is, meatless meatballs can taste just asdelicious and areevenhealthier than their meaty counterparts. Who knew?

These meatballs are based with tempeh, which is made from fermented soy beans.
I know, sounds suspicious. But thinkof nutritious soy beans processed in a way that makes it like tofu, but less processed. (More info here.) This not only means it’s firmer to work with, but also more nutritionally dense! One 4 ounce serving contains ~20grams of protein.
WHAT? Now that’s a meatball.

Plus, this recipe is simple with just 10 ingredients and roughly ~45 minutes total prep and cook time. That’s manageable, right? Even for the busy cook.

And the important part: What do they taste like? They’re
Warm
Savory
Tender on the inside
Firm with a crust on the outside
Italian herb-infused
Fresh
Simple
Satisfying
&amp; PERFECT with marinara and pasta
This recipewould be the perfect special weeknight meal. Though it takes a little more time to prepare, it’s still simple in nature and yields an incredibly satisfying meal that’s wonderfully healthy and nutritionally dense. What more could you ask for?

While I can’t offer you laundry service while you enjoy this meal (thanks, dad), I can say it’s worth the effort and is sure to satisfy the whole family.
We hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did! If you give it a try, be sure to let us know! Leave a comment, Pin it, or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. We genuinely love seeing what you cook up. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and prepare flax egg in a small dish.In a large, deep skillet, sauté onion and garlic in 1/2 Tbsp olive oil (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) over medium heat until soft and translucent - about 3 minutes. Set aside.Add tempeh to food processor and pulse to break down. Then add sautéed garlic, onion, and remaining ingredients (except olive oil) and mix, scraping down sides as needed. You want it to form into a moldable “dough.”Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. The tempeh will come across as a little bitter, but once coated, baked and served with marinara it's not nearly as apparent.NOTE: Depending on how salty your vegan parmesan cheese is, you may need to add a little salt and pepper at this point. However, I didn’t find it necessary.Scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts of dough and roll into balls. At this time, heat the same skillet you used earlier to medium heat.Mix remaining bread crumbs and parmesan cheese together in a shallow dish. Add tempeh balls one or two at a time and roll to coat.Add enough olive oil to form a thin layer on the bottom of your hot skillet, then add your coated tempeh balls in two batches, as to not crowd the pan. Brown for about 5 minutes total, shaking the pan to roll them around to brown all sides.Add browned meatballs to a baking sheet and add to the oven to bake for about 15 minutes, or longer if desired for a crispier result.At this time, prep any pasta your want to serve with your meatballs, as well as your favorite marinara sauce (I love this pizza sauce).Once meatballs are deep golden brown and fairly firm to the touch, remove from oven.To serve, top cooked pasta with meatballs and pour over marinara sauce. Top with another sprinkle of vegan parmesan cheese and fresh parsley. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when fresh."
612,Vegan Mexican Layer Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan 7-Layer Mexican Dip

I’m not a big sports person, butthe onset of fall gets me in the mood for game day-style snacking.
Notice I said “style.”
There is no actualgame watching going on, just the snacking, which is the best part in my opinion. Thankfully, I lucked out and married John who is the exact same. We prefer Netflix over football any day.

After discovering aVegan Mexican Cheese that requires no soaking or cooking, I knew I had to do something special with it. This dip immediately came to mind.
Seven layer dipsalways made an appearance at any sporting event I’ve ever been to, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be made on a random Wednesday when you’re having friends over. Or, if you justmake it and then proceed to eat it every day for lunch for an entire week with nothing but chips.
Oops. #soworthit


This vegan queso and those refried beans were meant for each other. Hubba, hubba.
It all comes together like so: (!!)

Ta-da! Isn’t that fancy? And the result is amazing. It’s:
Creamy
Flavorful
Savory
Fresh
Filling
Slightly spicy
&amp; So dang delicious and flavorful
Wave after wave of flavor it gets better with each bite. I found myself going back for seconds, then thirds, then (What? Who said that?).

Make this dip for neighbors, friends, family or just yourself, whether it’s game day or not. You will love the creamy texture, serious cheesiness, fluffy guac and perfect crunch from theveggies. Chips required, obviously.

","To prepare the cheese layer, scoop out 3/4 cup of spreadable Mexican Cheese and whisk in very hot water until it resembles queso - about 1/2 cup (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Alternatively, use my Cashew-less Vegan Queso.Next, prepare the guacamole by mashing all ingredients together in a bowl and adjusting seasonings to preference. Do the same with the pico de gallo (or just use your favorite salsa).To assemble the dip: Spread out vegetarian refried beans, then top with cheese layer, then guacamole, then pico or salsa, then bell pepper, then black olives, then cilantro.Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate.

613,Pumpkin-Spiced Apple Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin-Spiced Apple Pie

One thing I have yet to do in life is visit an apple orchard. I know.
I feel as though my childhood was somehow robbed of this experience and I’m set on redeeming it. Perhaps this month! But in the meantime, a friend of mine whose family grows their own graciously gifted me a giant bag of organic apples, so this will have to do for now.
Aren’t they beautiful?
I immediately knewwhat I wanted to do with them – make John’s all time favorite dessert: Apple pie! But with a twist.

To give the crust and filling a touch of pumpkin flavor, I added both pumpkin butter and pumpkin pie spice.
The result was an 8-ingredient apple pie with subtlepumpkin flavor and theperfect amount of sweetness and warmth. Mmm, this one is a winner, and a lovelypie to kick off fall baking.

For the crust – which is kept vegan with vegan butter –I attempted a lattice top! It was my first time trying my hand at this method and it certainly wasn’t the most beautiful thing to look at, but at least I tried!
You could also do a traditional top crust, or even a crumble! The filling is where it’s really at anyway.

This pie is a fall dream. It’s:
Warm
Sweet
Perfectly spiced
Loaded with apples
Pumpkin-infused
Perfect with coconut whip (or dairy-free ice cream)
&amp; Seriously simple
If you’ve never made a pie before, this would be a greatone for first timers! The apple filling is a no-brainer – just peel, cut, and toss with sugar + spices – and the crust is very basic.
Despite minimal effort, the result is superimpressive. As in, make this pie and impress all your friends with your pie skills. Do it!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and place a rack in the bottom 1/3 of your oven for optimal baking.Prepare filling by peeling and slicing apples into bite sized pieces or slices and tossing with cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, salt, sugar, pumpkin butter, and unbleached flour. Set aside.To prepare crust, whisk flour, salt, pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon in a large bowl. Then add cold butter and use a pastry cutter or fork to combine until crumbly.Add ice water 1 Tbsp at a time until a loose dough forms.Transfer to a floured surface and gently mold together with hands, handling as little as possible. Divide in two, making one (the bottom crust) slightly larger.Gently roll out the larger crust using only as much flour as needed, and carefully drape over a standard pie pan (mine is 9.5 inches) using a rolling pin to help transfer. Leave the edges hanging over and only trim areas of great excess and add those back to the other crust.Add the apple filling, reserving most of the excess liquid that's formed, and then roll out the other crust.You can cut the crust into strips and do a lattice top (tutorial here), or just lay the whole crust over the apples for a traditional top, in which case you’ll need to poke several little holes with a knife to let steam escape.Use your fingers to crimp edges and then brush the pie lightly with water or dairy-free milk and dust generously with sugar.Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Cover the edges with foil at the 30-minute mark so they don’t get too brown.Let cool completely before slicing or the filling will run - at least 3-4 hours. Best when fresh, but will keep for up to a few days. Serve with coconut whipped cream or your favorite non-dairy ice cream!"

Friends, it’s been a while.
How have you been? Do you love this time of year? I do. What haveyou been eating these days? Salads? Chocolate? Are you getting outside in this lovely, briskweather? Are you feeling well?I’d love to know.
Fallmakes me all emotional and introspective. I once cried for an hour after a scenic drive whenthe leaves were turning. We werelistening to Greg Laswell. I got all grateful and started weeping.Fingers crossed it’san annualoccurrence.Sometimes you just need a good cry.
Lately I’ve been eating lots of plants and less sugar. And I’ve been walking and running a lot. And books! I’ve finished a lot of books recently, which isn’t typical for me,this one being my favorite.
I’ve also been listening to a lot of podcasts. Podcasts always impact me. Especially this one onsustainability, this one on hospitality,and this one onminimalism. Good stuff.

Speaking of good stuff, how about them sweet potatoes?
For me, one of the most difficultparts of eating a plant-based diet is getting creative with meal ideas. Left to my own devices, I’d eat chips and guac for every meal. Clearly, that isn’t healthy or sustainable.
So, recently I’ve been trying to branch out and experiment withmore well-balanced meals, such as these Mediterranean Sweet Potatoes.


The concept is simple:
Baked sweet potatoes – cut in half to shorten cookingtime
Seasoned, roasted chickpeas
Garlic-herb sauce
Parsley-tomato salad for garnish
The result is a 30-minute lunch or dinner that’s both satisfying, savory and sweet, and seriously healthy.

This is my new favorite way to do Mediterranean. This dish is:
Savory
Sweet
Fresh
Smoky
Warm
Comforting
Seriously healthy
Filling
Customizable
&amp; Simple
I love how the sweetness of the sweet potatoes blends perfectly the chickpeas and garlic sauce, and the lemony parsley-tomato salad provides a zesty fresh finish. Friends, I’m in love.

As always, thanks for supporting what we do. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet with foil.Rinse and scrub potatoes and cut in half length wise. This will speed cooking time. Otherwise leave whole and bake longer (approximately double the time (45 min - 1 hour).Toss rinsed and drained chickpeas with olive oil and spices and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.Rub the sweet potatoes with a bit of olive oil and place face down on the same baking sheet (or another baking sheet depending on size).While the sweet potatoes and chickpeas are roasting, prepare your sauce by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine, only adding enough water to almond milk to thin so it’s pourable. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more garlic for more zing, salt for savoriness, lemon juice for freshness, and dill for a more intense herb flavor. I found mine didn’t need anything else.NOTE: If you don’t have hummus, tahini (which you can DIY!) will make a great base substitution for the sauce - just adjust the seasonings to accommodate the lack of flavor tahini provides.Also prepare the parsley-tomato topping by tossing tomato and parsley with lemon juice and setting aside to marinate.Once sweet potatoes are fork tender and the chickpeas are golden brown - roughly 25 minutes - remove from oven.For serving, flip potatoes flesh-side up and smash down the insides a little bit. Then top with chickpeas, sauce and parsley-tomato garnish. Serve immediately.Additional side ideas might include Hummus, Pita Chips, Baba Ganoush, or Persian Eggplant Dip. Enjoy!"
615,Simple Tofu Chilaquiles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Tofu Chilaquiles

A couple of years ago, I didn’t even know chilaquiles existed – I know.
But that all changed when somefriends of ours made us some for dinner one evening and the flavor and simplicity of the dish blew me away. I’ve been itching to veganize it ever since.

The base for this dishis a hearty5-ingredient sauce, which comes together fastand is not only flavorful, but also incredibly versatile.
While it’s perfect in this dish, I also suspect itwould be amazing on enchiladas, tofu scrambles, and more. I can’t wait to experiment with other uses.

Traditional chilaquiles recipes typically involve chips or fried tortilla strips, stir fried in a rich tomato sauce and topped with chicken, eggs and cheese. But this version remains vegan friendly yetstill amazingly flavorful.
Plus, it’s considerably healthier thanks to DIY baked tortilla chips.

This dish only takes 30 minutes to prepare, and issuper satisfying with 16 grams of protein per serving. I love it for breakfast, but it would also make the perfectbrunch or even weeknight dinner.
John and I attempted to split this skillet for lunch and couldn’t even finish it all! It was so filling and fresh and most importantly, husband-approved.

What does it taste like? I’m glad you asked. It’s:
Savory
Spicy
Saucy
Slightly crispy
Rich
Comforting
Healthy
Satisfying
&amp; Fast
Top this dish with some fresh cilantro, onion andVegan Mexican “Parmesan” Cheese for another wave of freshness andflavor. In my opinion, this step is a must.

","Start by quickly pressing/draining your tofu in a clean kitchen towel with a heavy pot on top, and preheating oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).IF BAKING YOUR OWN TORTILLAS: Lightly brush or spray both sides of your tortillas with olive or avocado oil and lightly dust them with sea salt. Stack and cut into triangles and arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until crisp and just slightly golden brown. Set aside. If using regular chips, skip this step.While chips are baking, heat a large skillet over medium heat and prep onion and garlic.Once hot, add 1 Tbsp olive or avocado oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft and slightly browned - 3 minutes. Then add garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes more.Add tomato sauce, diced chipotle and adobo sauce, and veggie stock. Heat until bubbly. Then reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.Transfer sauce to a blender (optional). For a completely smooth sauce, blend well. For a chunkier sauce, pulse and leave some texture. Set aside.Use a fork to crumble the tofu and place skillet back over medium heat (no need to rinse or wipe clean - the remaining sauce adds more flavor).Add a bit of oil to the pan and then add tofu. Let lightly brown for 3-4 minutes, stirring once or twice. Then add seasonings (chili powder, salt, garlic powder and cumin) and stir. Cook for another 2 minutes, then remove from pan and set aside.Add chips to the pan and pour over sauce, stirring quickly to coat. Then top with tofu scramble, fresh onion, and cilantro and serve immediately. Additional toppings might include hot sauce, lime juice, salsa and/or Vegan Mexican Cheese. Serves 2-3 as original recipe is written. Best when fresh."
616,Vegan Mexican Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mexican Cheese (Three Ways)

The thing about cheese is, I love it. However, my body is like “ah, nah.”
The thing about this Cashew-less Vegan Queso is, it’s delicious. But my watch is like “ah, nah.”
The thing about this recipe is, it takes 10 minutes and tastes like the real deal. Ah, yeah.

I absolutely adore eggplantand cashewcheeses, but the time commitment is a little too much for everyday use. So one dayI started to wonderif you could make Vegan Mexican “Parmesan.” Answer? Yes.
Then, I wondered if you could add that back to the processor and make cheesy cashew butter spread. Answer? Yes.
Finally, I wondered if you could add hot water to that spread and make 10-minute pourable queso with no soaking or roasting involved. Answer? DOUBLE YES. Friends, this is a major win in my book.
The first way: Shakeable!
Add raw cashews, nutritional yeast, salt, cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to a food processor and blitz away.
Ta-da! You have shakeable Vegan Mexican Cheese, perfect for salads, tofu scrambles, tacos, and more.
Now that’s some adobo, bro.
Add the same ingredients as the shakeablecheese to the food processor with a little olive oil and you have a sexylooking spread. A chipotle pepper in adobo sauce takes it to the next level with a smoky, spicy wave of flavor.
This version is perfect as a dip, sandwich spread, or base layer in burritos. But we’re not done yet.

Add some hot water to the spreadable cheese and we’ve got queso!
This version is perfect for virtually any Mexican dish, especially nachos, burritos, taco salads, and dips. Sit tight because I’ve got a recipe coming next week using this version that makes theeperfect healthy vegan snack for parties, game days and lazy afternoon lounging. Can’t wait!

If you make this recipe in any form,please let us know! Leave a comment below, or tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram. We’d love to see what you come up with. Cheers!

617,Healthy Pumpkin Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Maple Pecan Granola

You guys, it’s fall. For instance, just the other day I put on a hooded sweatshirt. Point proven.
Can we move onto baking now?


So I have this super secret but not-so-secret plan to create a new granola recipe every time I run out of my last batch. Is that OK with you guys?
Idon’t like making the same thing twice anymore. Must be a side effectof food blogging. I’m totally fine with it though. It thrusts me out into the world and forces me to try new things.
Like this granola, for instance. It has pumpkin and maple and pecans, oh my! How can you go wrong (no seriously)?
This recipe is simple in that it requires just 30 minutes and 9 ingredients, most of which you’ll have on hand as autumn sets in (squeal).
Pumpkin? Check.
Maple syrup? Check.
Pecans and pepitas? Check and check.
Don’t you just love this time of year?


The all important question: What does it taste like? Happiness on a spoon. It’s:
Crunchy
Pumpkin-y
Nutty
Not too sweet
Perfectly spiced
Healthy
Satisfying
Customizable
&amp; Shareable
Because it’s loaded with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, this granola makes the perfect breakfast or snack. I love mine with a little almond milk. That’s really all it needs.
Bonus: Itwould also make a lovely gift for fall birthdays and other special occasions. Give a friend granola, you’ll have afriend for life. That’s what I say.

If you make this granola, give us a virtual high five in the form of a social media shout out! Tweet us @minimalistbaker or tag your Instagram #minimalistbaker, so we can see all the fall goodness you bake up. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).Mix the oats, nuts, seeds, spices, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil, maple syrup, and pumpkin puree and whisk. Pour over the dry ingredients and quickly mix with a wooden spoon.Spread the mixture evenly onto two baking sheets (or bake in two batches // adjust if altering batch size) and bake for 23-33 minutes, stirring a bit near the halfway point. If you prefer chunkier granola, don’t stir as it breaks up the clusters. Instead, just rotate the pans at the halfway point to ensure even cooking.Once the granola is golden brown (usually about 25 minutes), remove from oven and let cool completely. It will crisp up as it cools.Transfer to an airtight container. Should keep for a couple weeks. Enjoy with almond milk, dairy-free yogurt, or on top of oats!"
618,Chocolate Peanut Butter Avocado Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Avocado Pudding

I don’t whattook me so long to share my takeon avocado pudding, but it was long overdue! This stuff is amazing. If you’ve never tried it, now is your chance.

I rarely eat chocolate without peanut butter. The two just go hand in hand. So it was a no brainer to add a healthy spoonfulinto this creamy, rich, nutritionally-dense pudding.

Nutritionally dense, you say? Yes!

Avocados are rich inhealthy fats, folate, carotenoids and are extremely heart healthy.
Bananas provide Vitamin B6, potassium, fiber and natural sweetness.
Chocolate provides antioxidants and magnesium.
And peanut butter adds protein and even more healthy fats.

That’s one healthy bowl of pudding, yo.

The great thing about this pudding – besides its immensely rich texture and chocolate flavor – is that it’s naturally sweetened with dates. Of course, you can substitutewhatever other natural sweetener you prefer– maple syrup and agave being ideal.
It’s also customizable. If you prefer an intense chocolate flavor, add less sweetener. And if you’re like me, you likeyour pudding on the sweeter side and will prefer adding more. It’s extremely forgiving and flexible in this way.
And did I mention rich?

In my opinion, the coconut whipped cream and additional peanut butter on top are essential. It adds another level of decadence and wave of flavor that just brings it all together. Please follow my example.

You guys are going to LOVE this pudding. It’s:
Rich
Creamy
Chocolaty
Peanut buttery
Not too sweet
Thick
Fudgy
Nutritionally dense
Customizable
&amp; A heart-healthy snack or dessert

","Add all ingredients except coconut whip into a food processor and blend until creamy and smooth. Add more dairy-free milk to thin/help blend. Add more cocoa powder for a richer chocolate flavor. Add more sweetener of choice to enhance sweetness.Divide between 6 small serving glasses (as original recipe is written), cover with plastic wrap (pressing the plastic wrap down on the pudding to prevent a skin from forming) and chill for a few hours, or overnight.Before serving, top with coconut whipped cream and drizzle of salted peanut butter.Leftovers will keep in the fridge up to a few days, though best when fresh."

Every now and again you lovely readers send me emailswith recipe requests.
One such requestcamerecently froma mother hopingto recreatetheveggie beet burger a localrestaurant serves that her daughter just happens to love. All other searches for “beet black bean burger” left her a littleoverwhelmedat the extensive ingredient lists and time commitments.
Minimalist Baker to the rescue.

This recipe is easy to master, nutritious, flavorful, and most importantly,simple. Just10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour required (less depending on cooking method). Plus, it’s loaded with nutrient-rich foods like raw walnuts, black beans, quinoa, and raw beets.

These burgersare loosely inspired by the beet-quinoa burgers served seasonally at LT Burger in Sag Harbor, New York. Of course, I haven’t tried them myself, but the reader who emailed just raved about it. And if her daughter who thinks most veggie burgers are “weird” loved this one, there must be something special about it.
After scanning their menu I seriously wanted to visit the area just to sample LT’smenu. But for now, recreating their recipes from afar will have to do.

I was quite pleased with how these little guys turned out. They’re
Hearty
Smoky
Flavorful
Tender and moist on the inside
Perfectly crisp on the outside
Not at all mushy
Simple
Savory
&amp; Perfect for satisfying killer burger cravings
Another thing I love about them is thatthe raw beets give them a deep magenta hue that makes them irresistibly beautiful. Even veggie burger skeptics are sure to fall in love.

","Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add some nonstick spray or a bit of olive oil. Once hot add the onion and sauté, seasoning with a pinch each salt and pepper.When the onions are soft – about 5 minutes – turn up the heat to medium and add the mushrooms. Season with another pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the mushrooms and onions are slightly browned and fragrant – about 3 minutes.Remove from heat and add black beans and mash. You’re looking for a rough mash, so you can leave a bit of texture if you want.Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and add the quinoa, beets, spices and stir. For even more flavor, add a shake of vegan worcestershire or A-1 sauce (optional).Lastly, add the walnut meal a little at a time until the mixture is able enough to form into patties. Set in the fridge to chill while your oven preheats to 375 degrees F (190 C) (skip this step if cooking on the stovetop or grill - see notes).Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray or olive oil. Form mixture into roughly 8-9 patties (as original recipe is written). I use a peanut butter jar lid lined with plastic wrap to get the perfect shape (a tip I learned from Iowa Girl Eats). You can also just take handfuls and mash them into loose patties. The thicker you make them, the longer they’ll take to cook through, but the “juicier” and heartier they’ll be! Thinner patties will cook faster.Arrange burgers on a baking sheet and brush or spray the tops with olive oil. Bake at 375 F (190 C) for a total of 30-45 minutes, gently flipping at the halfway mark. Cook longer to dry them out even more and achieve more crisp, but it’s not necessary.Serve on small buns or atop mixed greens with desired toppings. See notes for freezing instructions."

I’ll tell you what. You need a post-workout recovery drink, sister. And today, that’s just what I’ve got.

This workout drink is inspired by ZICO’s Chocolate Coconut Water. I know: Chocolate coconut water? Sounds weird. But NO, it’s not. It’s perhaps my best beveragediscovery oflate.
What’s it taste like? Just like the creamy, rich, sweet chocolate milk of your childhood with aslighthint of coconut. Every time I drink it I wish I hada giant maple long john in hand, just like my former 8-year old self would’ve done. Those were the days.


Thankfully, even though this coconut water tastes like purechocolate milk, it’s dairy free and makes the perfect base for a post workout recovery shake with antioxidant-rich cocoa powder, electrolyte-containing coconut water, and a hint of coconut cream for that rich, creamy texture every smoothieneeds.
It’s also loaded with:

Quantity eaters rarely take one bite of a dessert and say, “Oh my, that’s too rich for me to finish. I’ll pass. ” But rather, “Oh, man, that’s so good I need two spoons to eat it faster.”
And if this describes you, banana splits are likely your kind of dessert. So many layers of flavor, and more importantly, somuch volume.

You guys know I couldn’t createNo-Churn Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream and do nothing with it. That would be borderline sin. Plus, avegan banana split wasbegging to be made. I’m kind of a chocolate-banana freak, so it was practically destiny.

622,No-Churn Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Churn Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream

Up until last year, I didn’t own an ice cream maker. (And the only reason I have onenow is that I won one in a giveaway.)
But, I would always envy people who had one.“Ugh, those people with their ice cream makers. So fancy and cool, making their ice cream all the time. Ugh.”
In their defense, it’s totally worth it. Since winning mine I’vebeen putting it toextensive use: exhibitsA, B, C, D, and E.
But, fear not. Ihear the cries of the people, of youwho are weary of one more appliance; the cost, the space, the time it takes to pull it out of that dustycornercabinet, etc. And I answer with this:
Let not your lack of ice cream maker stand in the way of enjoying delicious, creamy, full-fat ice cream at home. Behold: No Churn Chocolate Ice Cream with all the richness, flavor and creaminess of the real thing, no ice cream maker required.


Here’s the deal. If you make coconut whipped cream and sweeten it with dates, good things happen. Such good things, in fact, that it makes the perfect base for creamy, dreamy ice cream, no churning required.
The magic happens withthe full-fat coconut cream, the vigorous whipping, and the mysterious date and its amazingabilityto resist freezing (a fact I discovered when making 5-Ingredient Caramel Peanut Butter Truffles). The result is an amazingly versatile ice cream base with tons of air incorporated sans churning.
Throw in some cocoa powder and BAM: a fluffy chocolate mousse-like base that freezes up beautifully.


What’s more? This recipe requires just 5 ingredients:
Coconut Milk or Cream
Cocoa Powder
Almond Milk
Dates
Vanilla
That’s it! And prep time is only30 minutes. Thedifficult part is the waiting for it to freeze. And if you’re impatient like me you poke your finger in the freezer every 15 minutes to see if it’s ready. Patience, young one. It’s worth the wait.


This ice cream is kind of amazing! It’s:
Creamy
Rich
Chocolatey
Fluffy
Perfectly Sweet
Scoopable
Refined sugar free
Natural
&amp; Seriously simple
Plus, it’s extremely customizable! Though I’ve yet to try other flavors, I can only assume that the base would work well with peanut butter, strawberries, and perhapseven dairy-free yogurt! Oh man, the possibilities are endless. I can’t wait to experiment.

Set aside.Without tipping the cans, scoop out the coconut cream from the cans of coconut cream OR coconut milk, reserving the clear liquid for other uses.

I ended up adding most of the date paste and a little more cocoa powder.Transfer to a parchment-lined freezer-safe container and cover loosely with plastic wrap, then foil to help freeze.You can take this out in a couple of hours for a chilled mousse-like ice cream.

","Press/drain tofu while preparing crust.Add walnuts to a food processor and pulse until a semi-fine meal is achieved.Then, with the processor running, drop in dates one at a time through the spout until the mixture resembles a dough.

Even though John’s not a huge morning person, I canalways lure him out of bed with these perfect, crispy 3-step breakfast potatoes that just happen to be vegan and gluten-free.

Three steps, you ask? That sounds complicated. However, it is not.

3.Brown

I believe I got this original method from my mother. I remember callingher one evening asking her how she made her crispy breakfast potatoes because I wanted to impress John with my cookingskills (side note: it totally worked). She explained it step by step and I’ve tweaked the process and made it my own since.
The only bad part? I prefer these to every other breakfast potato out there. Sorry restaurants, you simply don’t hold a flame to these crispy gems.


What does one eat with breakfast potatoes? I’m glad you asked.
Tofu scrambles
Omelets
Baked eggs
Frittatas
Even dinner!
These really are so versatile and easy to make, I end up cooking up a batch most mornings. It just isn’t breakfast in our house without a batch of these beauties.

","Heat a skillet to medium heat, or an electric skillet to 350 degrees F (176 C).""Bake"" your potatoes in the microwave for 4-6 minutes total (flipping once halfway through) until they have a little give when squeezed. Alternatively, bake them in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven placed directly on the rack for roughly 20-35 minutes, depending on their size, until soft to the touch.Cut cooked potatoes into bite-sized pieces (I usually quarter mine), and place vegan butter 1 Tbsp at a time onto the hot skillet. Only add enough to accommodate all of your potatoes.TIP: Place potatoes, one by one, onto the skillet directly in the melted butter ensuring both exposed cut sides touch the butter. This will ensure all sides get crispy brown.Once all potatoes are on the skillet, spray the top with avocado or olive oil (optional) and season with half of the seasonings. Spraying them with oil helps the seasonings stick to the skin.After about 4 minutes, use a fork or spatula to tip the potato over onto its other side to brown evenly.After another 3-4 minutes, flip the potatoes on their backsides (skin side down) and season with remaining salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cook for another 2-4 minutes until crispy and golden brown on all sides.Serve with hot sauce or Whiskey BBQ ketchup. These potatoes go great with our Vegan Omelet and Southwest Tofu Scramble."

Once you tackle a vegan omelethead on, it seems the only logicalthing to dois master the art of the tofu scramble. Not to sound cocky or whatnot, but I believe I may have done it. Let’s do this!

As you mayknow, I kinda have a thing fortofu.Sincefiguring out how to make it taste good, I’ve been stir frying it, eatingit in salads, putting it in Vietnamese Spring Rolls, and baking it to crispy peanut perfection. I can’t get enough of the stuff.
Recently, I’ve been loving tofu for breakfast. It makes sucha healthy, satisfying mealto have first thing in the morning as8ounces has nearly 20 grams of protein!

Tofu scrambles used to intimidate me. What goes in it? How do I cook it? Is there sauce involved? What if I’m afraid of turmeric? (Kidding but not kidding on the last one.)
Not so with his tofu scramble. It’s as simple as they come.
10 ingredients
30 minutes
1skillet
&amp; NO fancy methods

Seasoning tofu scrambleswas always a little dauntingto me. But after taking a tip from Beth at Eat Within Your Means, I realized how was ridiculously simple it was.
Just mix thedry seasonings of your choice with a little water and huzzah! You have a simple, pourable sauce – a tasty, zingy, spicy sauce, no less.

You guys are going to LOVE this scramble. It’s
Savory
Southwest-inspired
Healthy
Light

This is the perfect breakfast or bruncheven if you only have20 minutesto spend on food in the morning. Simply press your tofu the night before soit’s ready to add to your veggies and sauce! It doesn’t get much easier than that.

","Pat tofu dry and roll in a clean, absorbent towel with something heavy on top, such as a cast-iron skillet, for 15 minutes.While tofu is draining, prepare sauce by adding dry spices to a small bowl and adding enough water to make a pourable sauce. Set aside.Prep veggies and warm a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and the onion and red pepper. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook until softened - about 5 minutes.Add kale, season with a bit more salt and pepper, and cover to steam for 2 minutes.In the meantime, unwrap tofu and use a fork to crumble into bite-sized pieces.Use a spatula to move the veggies to one side of the pan and add tofu. Sauté for 2 minutes, then add sauce, pouring it mostly over the tofu and a little over the veggies. Stir immediately, evenly distributing the sauce. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until tofu is slightly browned.Serve immediately with the breakfast potatoes, toast, or fruit. I like to add more flavor with salsa, hot sauce, and/or fresh cilantro. Alternatively, freeze for up to 1 month and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave."
626,Almond Joy Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Joy Granola

“Super coconutty! That’s what I should say. It’s SUPER coconutty.”
Literally the thought I had while eating a bowl of this granola and penning this post. Whoever said I couldn’t multitask was a bigliar.


This granola was inspired by two things: 1) a reader suggestion! And 2) this Almond Joy Butter.
Truth be told, I wasn’t a hugealmond joy fan growing up. Snickers was where it was at, and later on, Caramelos and Milky Ways also floated my boat. I’m kind of a candy bar fan in general, if you couldn’t tell.

I didn’t really like coconut anything until giving coconut butter a try. And then onceI ventured into coconut milk territory, it was all over. The rest ishistory. Now it’s an all-out love affair.
This granola is infused with coconut two ways: Coconut flake and coconut oil. The combination of the two give it the perfect coconut flavor and texture without being too overwhelming.
The crispy oats and almonds lend extra texture and nutrition, and little specks of dark chocolate sweeten things up. If you’re like me, add more chocolatethan I list or you’ll just end up digging it all out of the jar because there’s inevitably never enough. #truestory


This recipe is not only grade-A delicious, it’s also simple. Just 9 ingredients and roughly30minutesrequired.
I find myself making granola at least once every coupleweeks to have on hand for breakfast and snacking. I had just cleared out my Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip batch when I madethis and I must say it’smade a lovely replacement.

I think you guys are going to love this granola. It’s
Crispy
Perfectly sweet
Super coconutty
Loaded withalmonds
Dark chocolaty
Reminiscentof an almond joy
&amp; Kind of perfect
Make this granola to have on hand for quick breakfasts and snacks on the go. And if you do, you know the drill. Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram to make me super happy and join the virtual granola party. Cheers!


","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).Mix the oats, coconut flakes, sugar, salt, and almonds together in a large bowl.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil, almond butter, and maple syrup (or other liquid sweetener), and pour over the dry ingredients. Mix well.Spread the mixture evenly onto one large or two small baking sheets (making sure not to crowd the granola // use fewer or more as needed if altering batch size) and bake for 20-25 minutes. Stir a bit near the halfway point to ensure even cooking.The coconut oil helps this granola crisp up nicely, but be sure to watch it carefully toward the end as it can burn quickly.Once the granola is visibly browned (about 23 minutes for me), remove from the oven and let cool completely.Once cooled, add chopped dark chocolate and toss. Alternatively, at a reader's suggestion, you can add the chocolate while the granola is still warm so it melts and coats the granola. GENIUS!Store in a container that has an air-tight seal and it should keep for 2-3 weeks."

I haveone of those super cool momswho brought in cupcakes for my class on my birthday. She always baked them in ice cream cones and she always topped them with tons of sprinkles.
Moms, birthdays, and sprinkles are the best (in that order).

I’m so excited I finally got around to vegan-izingfunfetti cupcakes.
Up until this pointmy favorite flavor of vegan cupcakeshasbeen chocolate, soit was due time totry my hand at good old fashioned vanilla. Turns out, vanilla has my heart, especially when sprinkles are involved.
This recipe may look a little complicated, but I assure you it only requires 1 bowl and less than 1 hour!
The ingredients are basic as well. If you’re like me, you always have vegan butter and sprinkles on hand anyway. If not, you’ll probably start doing so after trying these babes.


Quintessential funfetticupcakes have sprinkles inside the cupcake as well ason top of the frosting. If I could’ve figured outanother way to infuse sprinkles into these babes, I surely would’ve. I’ll report back on any such discoveries.

These cupcakes are seriously dreamy. They’re
Fluffy
Moist
Perfectly sweet
Vanilla infused
Loaded with sprinkles
Topped with MEGA fluffy buttercream
Super shareable
&amp; Slightly addictive
I may or may not have sampled one pre frosting…then another post frosting…then another just to ensure I hadn’t in fact gotten a wrong assessment. Turns out, I was right all along. These cakes are amazing!

Make these for book club and birthdays and anniversaries and casual Fridays and everything in between.
You and whomever you bestow them upon will not only experiencea slight sugar high, but also the pure bliss that ONLY comes from eating a cupcake loaded with icingand sprinkles. Enjoy!


NOTE: Recipe updated 3/20/19 to address crumbly texture and flat tops. We swapped the vegan butter for oil and it worked much better.
","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a standard muffin holder with 12 paper liners (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add non-dairy milk and vinegar or lemon juice to a large mixing bowl and let set a few minutes to curdle/activate. Then add oil and vanilla and whisk or use a hand mixer to beat vigorously to combine. Then add sugar and whisk or use a hand mixer to beat to combine/dissolve. It may splash so be careful!Add dry ingredients (omitting sprinkles) to a sifter in this order: two-thirds of the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and then the remaining third of the flour.Sift over wet ingredients and use a whisk or hand mixer to blend until well incorporated and no large lumps remain. The texture should be somewhere between thick and thin. Not liquidy, but not scoopable (rather, pourable). Somewhere near a buttermilk pancake batter consistency. We had to add another 1-2 Tbsp flour to thicken slightly.Add sprinkles and gently fold/stir with a rubber spatula or mixing spoon. Then divide batter evenly among cupcake holders making sure NOT to overfill. These do best at 3/4 of the way up.Bake on a center rack for 20-24 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. They will only have a very, very slight golden brown color.Let cool completely on a cooling rack. In the meantime, prepare frosting (optional). Wipe clean your mixing bowl and add softened butter. Beat until light and fluffy. Then add vanilla and mix once more.Add SIFTED powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time and continue mixing until thick and creamy. Scrape down sides as needed. If it gets too thick or crumbly, add a splash non-dairy milk to thin (optional). You want this frosting to be very thick so it will hold its shape once on the cupcakes. If it gets too thin, thicken with more powdered sugar.Once cooled, frost cupcakes and top with sprinkles. Serve immediately. Store leftovers covered at room temperature or refrigerated up to 3 days."

Alife list. Have you ever writtenone?
If you have, you know how difficult it is.
Maybe at the ripe old age of 28 I’ve simply done it all (sarcastic eye roll).But in all honesty, I like the person I’m becoming each day. I like that I try to beintentional about mylife and mywork, and when John andIsay wewant to do something we actually try and do it. I like that we spend everynew year’s evetalking aboutthe people we are and the people we want to become.

ZICOrecently offered to send us some of their coconut water and challenged me to come up with my ownlife list.
Until recently, I’ve been weary of coconut water andhadn’t found one I truly enjoyed. However,I was seriouslyimpressed at how natural and fresh ZICOtasted. Not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I especially enjoyed their Chocolate Coconut Water, infused with coconut cream and cocoa powder (hubba hubba). Considerme a new fan.

I love thatZICOis all about“crackinglife open” (as you would a coconut), or livingyour everyday life in a more adventurous and meaningfulway.
We’re all about that. ‘Life is short’ has always beenone of my favorite sayings, so I found this the perfect opportunity to set some new goals for myselfand start crossing things off.
Here’s 8 things I’d like to work on:

Try something new with photography each month (new styling, lighting, color scheme, etc.)
Spend 5minutes in prayer/meditationeverymorning
Invite a friend out to coffeetwice a month
Planmore fun, intentional dates with John (at least 1 per month)
Completea long distance bike ride (20+ miles)
Work on learning a new trade (graphic design?)
Go indoor rock climbing
Work on publishinga cookbook




On the topic of life is short, summer is almost over! Ahhhh. Let this cocktail be one last celebration of warmer weather, relaxed schedules and vacations galore.
It requires just 4 ingredients, is naturally sweetened withcoconut water, and has the perfect amount of tart from fresh lime. Mmmm – summer in a glass.

629,Baked Rosemary Beet Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Rosemary Beet Chips

I distinctly remember one December in college when my dad took me to his office Christmas party at a dinnertheatre. I hardly remember the show, but I do remember the buffet which seemed to extend into eternity with overcooked vegetables.
Among the saddestvictims were Brussels sprouts and beets. What is it about these beautiful, delicious veggies that makes people use and abuse them? They are delicious. They are rich with nutrients. They deserve another chance.Friends, wemust raise awareness.
(Dramatic, I know. But in the name of veggies I go to great lengths.)

I love roasting beets (I share my favorite way to eatthem in our downloadablecookbook). But for a quicker version that makesfor a crispy, salty snack, these chips are where it’s at.

These beet chips are about as simple as it gets: 30 minutes, 4 ingredients, 1 pan.
The only other tool you’ll need is a sharp knife or a mandolin for slicing. At the recommendation of my pal Kate, I recently invested in this mandolin. I’m usually incredibly hesitant to invest in equipment we don’t needin order to keep a clutter free kitchen.
But when I recognize I’m missing atool that couldhelpcomplete tasks in the kitchenmore efficiently, I’m all for it. If you like making veggie chips, veggie pastaand fries, this could be the slim-profile, affordable toolfor you.

Another perk of these chips?Beets are extremely healthy for you!
Read all about the benefits over on our Fudgy Beet Cupcakes post (and make the cupcakes while you’re at it).
Flavor wise, these chipslack that “dirty” earthy taste some people despise about beets (i.e. my husband). Andthesimple addition of rosemary adds an earthy aroma I adore.
Healthy? Flavorful? Fast? Count me in.

You guys are going to love these chips! They’re

I nearly gobbled these up in one sitting – couldn’t resist! Even if you aren’t a huge beet fan, give these a try. I thinkyou’dbe surprised how neutral in flavor, yet delightfully crispy they are. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and place oven rack in the center of the oven.Thinly slice beets with a mandolin (or a sharp knife), getting them as consistently thin as possible. They should curl a little when cut. This will ensure even baking and crispiness.Divide between two baking sheets and spray or very lightly drizzle with olive oil. Add a pinch of salt, pepper, and the rosemary. Toss to coat. Then arrange in a single layer, making sure the slices aren’t touching.Bake for 15-20 minutes or until crispy and slightly brown. Be sure to watch closely past the 15 minute mark as they can burn quickly.Remove from oven. Let cool. Then serve."
630,Crispy Baked French Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Garlic Matchstick Fries

French fries. We have an on-again off-again relationship.
Meaning I stuff my face withthem once a month then swear off them until we meet again next month.
Thankfully, however, I’ve recently mastered the art of making fries at home super crispy style sans frying. Score! Now the two of uscan see each other much moreoften –thank goodness.

I’ve made french friesbefore that required soaking in warm water before baking. Too much time and effort I say! These guys go straight into the oven at a high temp for ultimate crispiness.
It’s the matchstick shape and high temperature that helps them cook fasterand get that golden brown crisp. I’m all for a good wedge-cut fry, but for that ultimate crispy texture, matchstick is where it’s at.

For another wave of flavor I sauteed some minced garlic in olive oil to toss withthe fries fresh out of the oven. This is an optional step but certainly one that adds more zest and depth of flavor.


All that’s left is to dip in some Whiskey BBQ Ketchup and go to town. Oh mama.

I’m OBSESSED with these fries. They’re
Crispy
Salty
Tender on the inside
Garlicky
Perfect with ketchup

Toss to coat.Arrange fries a single layer making sure they aren’t touching too much. This will help them crisp up and cook evenly.Bake for 25-35 minutes, tossing/flipping at least once to ensure even baking.In the last 10 minutes of cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add 1-2 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and the minced garlic. Sauté, stirring frequently, until just slightly brown to wake up the flavor.Remove from heat and set aside.When the fries are finished, remove from oven, sprinkle again with sea salt, and spoon the warm garlic on top.

It takes a lot for John and me to fall hardcore in love with a new restaurant, but the minute Idipped one french fry into the whiskey bbq ketchup at Beer Kitchen in Kansas City, it was all over. It had to be made at home.

I’m already a condiment and sauce lover, so if there’s legithouse-made ketchup somewhere chances are I’ve tried it. Oddly enough though, I’ve never made my own! That had to change.
Since my love for the whiskey BBQ ketchup has become borderline obsession, I decided to try my hand at it. Although it’s not a total 1:1 match, I got dangclose!

Corn has always been one of my favorite summer foods.
I recallonce eating four cobs in one sitting at afamily cookout,much to my parents’ amazement. It’s just that good.

When the warmer months roll around, I’m all about corn:cornbread muffins, cornbread waffles,corn salsa, corn everything. In our cookbook, I evenshare my go-to cornbread and cornbread crouton recipes.So good with/on everything.
So, I figured it was primetime to add some corn soup to my repertoire, especially since it lends itself to well to creamy, brothy goodness. Enter, this summer corn soup.

The recipeissimple: 9 ingredientstotal, and likely things you have on hand right now. And not only is it both vegan and gluten free, but it can also be prepared one of two ways: Blended and smooth, or chunky and brothy.
I blended mine, but it would also be delicious left as is. I just happen to be all about the creamy vegan things. Can you really blame me?

I highly recommend making this soup as a last summer hurrah before fall arrives. Ithas the perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors, is healthy, and makes anideal light lunch or dinner when accompanied with bread, a sandwich or a salad. Enjoy!

","To a large saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil, onion, and garlic and sauté for 3-4 minutes.Add potato, season with a little salt and pepper, and cover to steam for 4-5 minutes.Add most of the corn, reserving a little for garnish, and stir.NOTE: If you plan to blend the soup, I recommend adding half broth, half milk for a more creamy texture. But if you intend to leave it unblended, forgo the milk and do all broth for best texture/flavor.Add broth and almond milk (if using), cover, and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to low. Cook until the potatoes are soft and slide off of a knife when pierced - about 5 minutes.If blending, add 3/4 of the soup to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. If using nutritional yeast, add now.Transfer soup back to the saucepan and bring back to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Cook for at least 10 minutes to let thicken. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it will be.To serve, top with chopped green onion, remaining fresh (or lightly sauteed) corn, and black pepper. Add a sprinkle of paprika for color."

634,Vegan PB&J Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake PB&amp;J Pie

My earliest memory of eating a PB&amp;J is when I was about 5 years old.
My family lived in New Mexico and my mom would take me to half-day Kindergarten in the morning, pick me up around noon and promptly make me a diagonal-cut PB&amp;J once we got home.
I would eat my sandwich hovering over a towel “place mat” on the floor in front of the television, eyes gluedon “Woody the Woodpecker,” slurping downmilkbetween oversized bites.
Life was good back then. Mom planned everything, fed me when I was hungry, made my bed. Activities includedcartoons, Nintendo and riding bikes. But life wasn’t “rich” then like it is now, filled with so many amazing peopleandexperiences, which is why I’m OK accepting adulthood with open arms.
Maybe eating a PB&amp;J today as an “adult”is some silly attempt to hang onto the simplicity of mychildhood – a time when life seemedeasy andNintendo wasking.
I think life can still be simple now, we just have to be intentional about it. And it doesn’t hurt to eat a PB&amp;J (pie) once in a while just to keep things in perspective; to stay humble.
Somehow the combination of peanut butter and jelly does that for me. It takesme right back to 5-year-old Dana, even if just for a lunch hour.

When setting out to make this recipe, I actually wanted to make a “PB&amp;J Dip,” which you could still totally do if you wanted to go crustless. But the minute I saw the way coconut whipped cream reacted to date “caramel,” I knew a pie was in order.


You guys? This filling? It’s amazing.
Coconut whipped cream is already delicious on its own. But when you (naturally) sweeten it with date paste and throw in some peanut butter, things get CRAY. It becomes the thickest, fluffiest most ridiculous pie filling you ever laid eyes on.
Don’t you worry. I have other ideas for this combo up my sleeve. And I LOVE that it’s entirely refined sugar-, dairy- and gluten-free! Amazing stuff going on over here.


So the pie. Assembly goes as following:
1. Bake 2-ingredient crust (the only baking involved)
2. Make strawberry compote and cool.
3. Whip coconut cream.
4. Add peanut butter and date paste.
5. Whip once more.
6. Add pie filling to crust and top with cooled compote.
7. Chill. Eat. Start living your life.
Capiche? Capiche. Let the party begin.



This pie is ridiculous. Hands down one of my favorite recipes to date. It’s
Fluffy
Thick
Peanut buttery
Perfectly sweet
Jammy
Fruity
Surprisingly light
Naturally sweetened
Loaded with flavor
Sealed with a graham cracker crust
Satisfying

Is there anything NOT to love about this pie? I think not. Plus, it can beeven further simplified by omitting the crust andmaking itadip instead.
Serving bowl, fluffy peanut butter layer, strawberry jam, served with graham crackers, cookies and fruit. Hello, dip geniewho suddenly has 15 friends lined up at your door for seconds.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and place a large mixing bowl in the freezer (for peanut butter mousse filling).Add graham crackers to food processor and process until a fine meal is achieved. Then add melted butter or oil and mix to combine. Transfer to pie dish (or an 8x8 square glass dish // adjust number or size of dish if altering batch size) and press evenly into a crust (use plastic wrap to help get it flat if you’re having trouble. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Then set aside to cool.Prepare compote in a saucepan by cooking strawberries and orange juice (optional) over medium heat until very bubbly. Then reduce heat to low and continue simmering to thicken. Use a wooden spoon to smash the fruit. Turn off heat, add chia seeds (optional), and stir. Chill in the fridge.Add dates to the food processor and process until small bits remain or a ball forms. Then add a touch of coconut oil and a little warm water. Process until a thick paste forms. Add a pinch of salt for flavor balance if desired. Set aside.Being careful not to tip the cans, remove coconut milk from the fridge and carefully scoop the thickened cream into your chilled mixing bowl, leaving any runny, clear liquid in the can.Beat with a mixer until fluffy and peaks form. Then add peanut butter and date paste a little at a time until desired flavor is achieved. I went with ~1/2 cup peanut butter and nearly all of the date paste. Transfer filling to crust, spread into an even layer, and chill for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.At this point you can either slice the pie and then serve with desired amount of chilled compote, OR spread all of the compote over the pie just before serving.Pie will keep in the fridge for up to a few days. Freeze after that and serve as an “icebox” pie (thaw for 15-20 minutes before serving)."

Not that eating the same thing every day isnecessarily a bad thing. But it seems the moresimple options I have on hand, the more likely I am to branch out. Enter: these waffles.

This simple base really is the perfect everyday waffle that you can then dress up as you please. You know, for branching out purposes (wink).


For the gluten free flour blend, I use my go to blend which you’l find in the notes. I find it to provide the perfect amount of crispinesswithout any grittiness. Maple syrup or agave nectar (or raw honey if not vegan) acts as a natural sweetener, while GFoats add a touch more fiber and texture.

For small households these waffles are excellent frozen and toasted up as needed. I like to split my frozen waffles in half and pop them in the toaster. Otherwise, you can heat them up ina400 degree oven until golden brown and warmed through for a similar effect.


Make these your everyday waffle and customize as you wish! If you do give them a try, be sure to take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I absolutely love seeing what you ladies and gents cook up. Cheers!

","Combine almond milk and vinegar in a small mixing bowl and let set for a few minutes to curdle/activate. Then add olive oil, agave nectar or maple syrup and whisk. Set aside.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Test batter for sweetness and flavor. Add more sweetener or some vanilla extract if desired. I added a touch more agave.Let set for 5-10 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. (I set mine to 4 out of 5 for a crispier waffle, but adjust yours according to preference.)Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray and pour on about 1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a baking rack in a 200 degree oven to keep warm. Do not stack and instead keep them in a single layer to ensure crispiness remains.Serve immediately with desired toppings, such as fresh cherry-berry compote and more maple syrup. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results (see notes for more instructions). Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple of months, although they're freshest within the first couple of weeks."
636,Peanut Butter Oreo S'mores | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter S’moreos

OK, can you just indulge me for a moment?
I know what this looks like: Unadulterated, full on fat kid food. That’s because it is.
But if there’s one thing I’velearned about life thus far it’s that time flies and life really is short and you’ve got to take advantage of moments and experiences whenyou can. Otherwise they’re gone in a snap and you wake up one day and realize you never did any of the things you said you wanted to do (whoa, that escalated quickly.) But seriously.
You know how it goes. You say you’re going to swim all summer long because winter was dreadful, but you only make it to the pool once. Or you beat yourself up for having one too many chocolates at that party last night, but in reality you didn’tgain a single ounceand all that energy was wasted on stress and guilt when it could’ve been used to enjoy your company andthat last delectable bite.
Have I plead my case? Are you convinced to live in the moment and enjoy the little things? I hope so. And I also hope that one of those “little things” is one of these s’more(o)s. Because dang girl, you deserve it.


The best thing about these S’moreos* is that they can be made inside or out so you don’t need a campfire or fire pit! You onlyneed an oven with a broiler and you’re good to go.
What else is simple about them? 3ingredients, 5 minutes and 1 pan required. Does it get any better? I think not.

The assembly is super simple, too. Just top half of your Oreos with a marshmallow, toast until golden brown, drizzle with salty peanut butter and smooshdown with your other Oreo.
Voila! It’s as easy as that.





Boom, it’s magic. These S’moreos are LEGIT. You’re going to love them! They’re
Warm
Gooey
Seriously decadent
Chocolaty
Peanut buttery
Salty-sweet
Oozing with toasted marshmallow goodness
Customizable (add a peanut butter cup or strawberry jam instead of PB!)
Shareable
&amp; Perfect any time of year
Here’s what I suggest: Invite over some friends, challenge everyoneto revisit their summer bucket list and knock off at least one more item beforewe up and slip into fall.
Life is short! Oreos deserve to be upgraded with peanut butter and marshmallow. Just do it.

And if you do, be sure to take a picture of your gathering ORyour solo-lady S’moreo party and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to seeyou in action living it up this summer. Cheers!

","Place an oven rack on the second highest position and preheat oven to high broil.Place 10 Oreos (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) on a baking sheet and top with a marshmallow (or several minis).Broil on high for 1-3 minutes, watching closely, until toasted and deep golden brown.Remove from oven and top each with 1/2 Tbsp peanut butter (briefly warm in microwave if not pourable), then top with second Oreo.Consume immediately."
637,Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Granola

Peanut butter and chocolate just go together. Can we agree on that?
OK, then we can move onto how DELICIOUS this granola is! Perfectly crisp peanut buttery oats sprinkled with dairy-free chocolate chips. It’s like Christmas in the mouth.


This granola is my simplest yet! Mama so proud.
Just 6 ingredients and about 30minutes required. And you likely already have all the ingredients you need on hand! Those are the best kind of recipes, no?


The process is simple:
Stir oats and sugar
Warm peanut butter, olive oil and maple syrup (or sweetener of choice)
Pour onoats and toss
Bake until golden brown
Cool and add chocolate chips!
Then you get to experience the goodness that is Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Granola. (A little secret? It’s basically like eating a candy bar for breakfast – THE GREATEST.)


If you’re a peanut butter lover you’re going to flipover this granola. It’s
Crunchy
Savory
Peanut buttery
Perfectly sweet
Studded with chocolate chips
Full of fiber and protein (you know, healthy!)
Super satisfying
Ahealthier dessert
&amp; Kind of perfect
It also makes a great gift for fellow peanut butter chocolate fiends. I gifted some of this batch to my birthday twin, Bet. I think she was pretty stoked (or she’s a really good liar). Don’t tell her but I kept half for myself. What? It was my birthday, too!



If you try this granola, let us know! Take a picture and share it on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #minimalistbaker. Or Pinit. (Do you follow us there? You should totally follow us there.) Fair warning though: it’ll make all your friends jealous of your breakfast eats. (But so worth it.) Cheers!


","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).In a large mixing bowl, combine oats and sugar. (Note: this helps add an extra crispiness to the final product and sweetens it up a bit more. But if you're sugar conscious, it's optional. However, I recommend it!)Warm peanut butter, oil, and maple syrup or agave in a small skillet or saucepan until thoroughly combined and pourable.Pour over oats and quickly toss/stir to combine. If it appears too wet, add more oats (mine was just right).Spread evenly on a large baking sheet (or two small baking sheets) and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until evenly golden brown. Watch closely as it tends to brown quickly near the end. IMPORTANT: Toss once around the 15-minute mark to ensure even baking.Remove from oven, toss gently to release heat and let cool completely on the pan.Transfer to mixing bowl or storage container and add chocolate chips (optional) and stir or shake.Eat with almond milk - my favorite. Sliced bananas take it to the next level.Will keep fresh for up to two weeks. Freeze after that."
638,Cherry Limeade Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cherry Limeade Smoothie

In the small town I grew up in, there was one main road down the middle of town and when we got a Sonic put in next to the gas station, it was a big deal. Watch out everybody, we’re big city now.
My favorite drink hasalways has been a cherry limeade. So refreshing, bubbly and perfectly tart and sweet. I especially lovethecherry and squeezed limes at the bottom to nosh on once the drink isgone.
I don’t frequent Sonic much anymore (unless we get a serious craving for PeachIcedTea), but a craving for something cherry and lime occasionally still persists. Enter: This smoothie. 5 ingredients, tart and sweet, and perfect asa healthy breakfast on the go.


It starts with loads of cherries and fresh lime juice for that quintessential cherry limeade flavor. Ripe nectarine adds creamy texture and a sweet touch that’s neutral but complements the cherries perfectly. Almond milk adds creaminess, while ice chills everything down.
It’s like a breakfast cherry limeade to-go. Yes, please.

This smoothie is like summertime in a glass. It’s
Creamy
Cold
Citrusy
Cherry-infused
Perfectly tart-sweet
Naturally sweetened
Vegan and gluten-free
&amp; Highly portable
Most mornings we have a smoothie of some form for breakfast and I definitely see this making an appearance in our weekly rotation. Not to mention, it would make an awesome popsicle if you had leftovers. Just sayin’.


Hope you enjoy this smoothie as much as we have. If you make it, you know what to do: Snapa picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can be cherry limeade buds. OK? K. Cheers!

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavors as needed, adding more cherries for sweetness and more lime for tart.Recipe as originally written yields 2 small smoothies or one large smoothie. Optional: Freeze leftovers into Popsicles."
639,Vegan Banana Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Banana Cream Pie Blizzards

I can’t tell you how many blizzards I’ve had in my life. It’s an embarrassing amount. But what I can tell you is 99% of them have been banana cream pie (with peanut butter cups) and lotsa whipped cream.
Because, ‘Merica.

But, sincedropping dairy I haven’t had been able to enjoy this creamy, dreamy treat for close to a year! And that’s a travesty, because in my books it isn’t summer until a frosty banana cream pie blizzard has crossed my lips.
Lucky for me, there are workarounds. And it starts with this 1-ingredient banana powder.

I had the idea to grind banana chips into a banana powder after watching the teenagers at Dairy Queen scoop a mysterious yellow powder into my blizzard. What is it? Nobody knows.
The important thing is it can be duped with ground banana chips. Naturally sweet, naturally delicious. Huzzah!

This blizzard is 100% naturally sweetened and requires just 7 ingredients.
Banana chips
Cashews
Non-dairy milk
Dates
Vanilla
Coconut oil
Banana
That’s it! These simple ingredients combine to create one seriously creamy banana cream pie treat that’s entirely dairy-free.Graham crackers (or another vegan-friendly cookie) are certainly optional but highly recommended for a true cream pie experience.


This blizzard is kind of amazing. It’s
Cold
Creamy
Smooth
Infused with banana TWICE
Perfectly sweet
Super satisfying
&amp; Seriously close to the real thing
Make this blizzard and you’ll fall in love. And be sure to make our Chocolate Chocolate Chip version, too! Both delicious, both perfect for hot summer days.


Last but not least, to prove itself worthy of the “Blizzard” title, the upside down trick…Yep!
If you make this recipe, be sure to take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. That way we can have an ice cream social online. It’s the best. Cheers!

","The night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill. Also, make sure you soak your cashews overnight OR the next day for at least 6 hours. Be sure to drain thoroughly before adding to blender.Grind your banana chips in a coffee or spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle. If using a spice grinder, not all of the chips will grind. Pick out parts that didn't grind for other uses.Add all ice cream ingredients EXCEPT raw banana and cookies to blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Use the “liquify” or ""puree"" setting if you have it to get it completely creamy and blended. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana powder or dates if desired.Chill mixture in the freezer for 2 hours, or in the fridge overnight. If you don't have an ice cream maker, see notes.Add chilled mixture to ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve.For a true blizzard experience, spoon directly into 2-3 serving glasses (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and layer with fresh sliced bananas and crushed vegan cookies. Optional, top with coconut whipped cream.Alternatively, transfer mixture to a freezer safe container, cover and freezer until firm - about 4-6 hours and scoop as ice cream."
640,Caramel Peanut Butter Truffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Salted Caramel Peanut Butter Truffles

I used to think truffles were complicated. I used to think they required candy thermometers and carefulattention and Maldon sea salt and only the finestand most expensive ingredients available. I thought they simply weren’t for me.
I was wrong.

It all starts with date caramel. Have you triedthe stuff? If not, YOU HAVEN’T LIVED.
Sticky medjool dates pitted and processed then spiked with sea salt for flavor balance.Raw salted vegan caramel. Yes, please.


Up next? Use a melon baller or a measuring spoon to scoop out truffle shapes (or roll them with your hands!). Then freeze before drizzling with creamy, salted peanut butter. Now we’re getting somewhere.


Last but not least? Dunk those babies in dairy-free dark chocolate and sprinkle with a touch more sea salt. A quick trip to the fridge or freezer and these gems are ready for fast and immediate consumption.
Watch yourself, they’re addictive.


You guys are going to FLIP over these truffles. They’re:

After sampling my first two I promptly hauled these down to the office staff in our apartment building. Otherwise? These would’ve been gone in an hour. So tasty!

If you give these truffles a go, be sure to snap a pic and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so I can see how yours came out! I love seeing whichrecipes you guys try and love. Cheers, friends!

","If your dates aren’t sticky and super moist when squeezed, soak in hot water for 10-15 minutes to soften. Then drain thoroughly and pit. Otherwise, just pit and add to food processor.Blend/pulse your dates until they form a loose ""dough."" Mine usually turns into a ball, which is what you're going for.If it’s not quite combining, drizzle in a tiny bit of warm water - 1 tsp at a time - scraping down sides as needed, and mix until a rough paste or ball forms. If you add too much water it will be difficult to handle them later as they won’t freeze up well.Lastly, add sea salt and mix once more to incorporate. Taste and adjust saltiness level if desired.Using a small melon baller or a Tablespoon and finger, scoop out small balls and roll/form them into balls. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 20-30 minutes to set.In the meantime, drizzle on peanut butter until the top is coated. If your peanut butter is super firm and not spreadable (meaning it's either dry or not the natural variety), add it to a small mixing bowl with 1/2 TBSP coconut oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and microwave to melt (or heat in a small saucepan). Stir to combine, then proceed as instructed.Freeze again for another 15-20 minutes, or until the peanut butter has formed a semi-firm “shell.”Warm the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments with coconut oil.Remove truffles from freezer and, using a fork, scoop truffles up and quickly immerse in chocolate, using a small spoon to drizzle chocolate evenly on top. Then gently shake off excess chocolate and place back on parchment-lined baking sheet. Alternatively, you could place the truffles on a fork and drizzle the tops with chocolate. Freeze to set again, then dip the bottoms in chocolate and place on parchment to cool. This achieves less of a ""shell"" and more of a drizzled effect.Top truffles with a small sprinkle of sea salt (optional), and repeat until all truffles are coated.Place back in freezer or fridge to set - about 30 minutes. Set out from the the freezer or fridge to serve. For softer truffles, let come to room temperature.Store in a freezer-safe container in the fridge or freezer to keep fresh. Makes about 20 truffles as original recipe is written."
641,Simple Fruit Compote | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Berry Compote

I hosted a waffle brunch once. It’s true.
Have you ever attended a waffle brunch? It’s a breakfast party wherein the host provides hot, fresh waffles and the guests bring his or her favorite toppings. It’s like a waffle bar, and it’s quite lovely.
You know what? You should hostone yourself. And if you do, be sure to have plenty ofthis simple, 2-ingredient compote on hand. It’s sure to be the most popular topping of all.

Formy waffle brunch, my friend Lauren made a version of this compote, only she went with fresh ginger and blueberries she picked from her garden. Yes, she’sthat cool.
Anyway, I’d never made compote before and she taught me how.
The concept is simple: Throw your favorite fresh or frozen fruit (berries and stone fruit workbest) into a pot and add a little juice to get a sauce going. If your fruit is sour, add a little sugar. For more flavor, add ginger, cinnamon, or another spice of choice.
For this very summery version I went with half cherries, half strawberries and a splash of orange juice for a fresh citrus touch.



The best part? It comes together in just 20 minutes. And once it’s done, you can put it on everything:
Waffles
Pancakes
French toast
Coconut cream PIE french toast
Ice cream sundaes
Oatmeal
You get the drift. It’s so warm and fruity and delicious you’d never guess it was mega healthy for your bones.



You’re gonna love this compote. It’s

642,Vegan Roasted Red Pepper Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Roasted Red Pepper Pasta (GF)

Just when I thought red pasta couldn’t get any better, I discovered the magic that is roasted red peppers.
Creamy, velvety, savory, andsubtlysweet, it makes the perfect flavor companion to vegan parmesan and fresh herbs in this 10-ingredient veganand gluten-freepasta.

The magic starts with sautéed shallot and garlic to give the sauce a robust and subtly sweet base. In the meantime, roast up some red peppers until soft, charred and delicious. This will give your sauce that gorgeous orange hue and creamy texture.

To keep this pasta gluten free I went with a gluten free spaghetti noodle and used cornstarch as my thickener instead of a traditional flour roux. The result was a creamy,thicksauce just begging to be tossed with perfectly al dente noodles.

The sauce gets its flavor from foursources:
1. Sautéed garlic &amp;shallot
2. Roasted red pepper
3. Nutritional yeast
4. Salt, pepper, and red pepper flake
Together this combination provides the perfect balance of savory, sweet and heat, while fresh parsley adds a touch of freshness.

You’re going to love this pasta. It’s
Creamy
Luxurious
Savory
Subtly sweet
Perfectly “cheesy”
Healthy
Vegan + GF
Customizable (add a protein, additional herbs, veggies)
&amp; Totally satisfying
Make this dish for a simple-but-healthy weeknight meal, or reserve it for gatherings with friends who havespecial dietary needs.
Use whatever noodles you like– gluten freeor not, or even spiralized veggies! And feel free to adda bit more protein of choice for extra staying power, although most gluten-free noodles I’ve found provideample protein and fiber.

","Heat oven to 500 degrees F (260 C) and roast red peppers on a baking sheet until charred - about 25-30 minutes. Cover in foil for 10 minutes to steam, then remove (peel away) charred skin, seeds and stems. Set aside.Cook pasta according to package instructions; drain, toss in a touch of olive oil, cover with a towel and set aside.While the red peppers are roasting, bring a large skillet over medium heat and sauté onion and garlic in olive oil until golden brown and soft - about 4-5 minutes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.Transfer sautéed shallot and garlic to blender with roasted peppers, almond milk, red pepper flake, nutritional yeast and cornstarch. Season with desired amount of salt, pepper, and red pepper flake.Blend until creamy and smooth, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper or nutritional yeast for flavor. You want the flavor to be pretty robust and strong since the noodles don't have much flavor - so be generous with your seasonings.Once blended, place sauce back in the skillet over medium heat to thicken. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and continue simmering.Once sauce is thickened to desired consistency (see photo), add noodles. However, before tossing add a touch more olive oil, salt and pepper to the un-tossed noodles for added flavor. Then, toss to coat.Serve with (generous amounts of) vegan parmesan, red pepper flake, and fresh chopped parsley or basil."

Today, I turn 28.
Of the many things I’ve learned I realize the bulk of those lessonshave come in the last couple of years.
I’ve learned to trust my instincts and be OK with the unconventional. I’ve learned the importance ofdoing what I love even if it feels silly. I’ve grown to love food photography even more than I did when we first started this blog. I’ve learned that running a food blog with your spousecan not only be fun but also ridiculouslyfulfilling. I’velearned I still love cake and pancakes and simplicityand saying “hubba, hubba,”and probably always will.
Enough about me. This space is about you guys, really. I love to cook and take photos of the things I make and then share them with you all. That is what makes me supremely happy – the best birthday gift ever.
To celebrate all of these wonderful things, I made youcheesecakes. Peanut Butter Cup 9-ingredient vegan cheesecakes that screamsimplicity: No springform pans, no water baths, no baking (besides the 5-minute crust). Just pure chocolate-peanut butter goodness that even the amateur cook can master.
If you have the ability to blend and pour, you can makethese little bites of heaven. All you need is 30 minutes and a muffin tin and you’re golden.

Yes, oreo cookies are vegan! I think it was the universe’s way of saying “vegans can have fun, too.”
This crust is the only part of the recipe that requires baking (5 minutes) and it’s optional. I just prefer a bitmore firm crust. But if you’re OK with more crumbly, leave the oven off for today.


The filling? Simple.
Soaked cashews
Saltedpeanut butter
Lemon
Maple syrup
Coconut milk (or another non-dairy milk)
Coconut oil
The 2-ingredient chocolate ganache? That’s optional (but oh so recommended).


Swirly McTwirly and you have a masterpiece on your hands. The only thing left to do is top these beauties with a chopped mini dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Hubba, hubba.


These cheesecakes are near perfection. They’re
Creamy
Sexy
Peanut buttery

Infused with dark chocolate
Sealed with an oreo crust
Loaded with PB Cup flavor
Seriously satisfying

While I do keep health in mind most days, birthdays are my excuse to go all out (hence these cheesecakes). These may not be health food but they are a smarter dessert with (mostly) healthy fats, lots of protein, and portion control built in. Happy birthday to me.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and blitz Oreos in a food processor until a fine meal remains. Add melted coconut oil (or vegan butter) and pulse once more.Cut 12 small strips of parchment paper (or use paper liners // adjust amount if altering batch size) and place them in a standard, 12-slot muffin tin. One at a time, hold down a strip in the center of the tin, add 1 generous spoonful of crust mixture, then use a small cup or your spoon to pack it down as evenly as possible. I like using a small glass because it packs it in really tightly and gets the top flat. Continue until all tins are filled and no crust remains.Bake for 5 minutes. Then remove and set aside to cool.NOTE: For the coconut milk, I like to scoop the ""cream"" off the top because it provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together, just add it in as is.Add drained cashews, lemon juice, coconut oil, coconut milk, maple syrup and peanut butter to a blender and process until very smooth and creamy - about 3-4 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. You need to make sure you get it really smooth with no small pieces or you’ll taste them in the final result. If your mixture is too thick, add a bit more coconut milk or oil to get it going. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Pour evenly into muffin tins on top of crust and gently top on counter to remove air bubbles.Prepare ganache by bringing smaller measurement of coconut milk (3 Tbsp  as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to a simmer in the microwave (30 seconds) or on the stove top in a small saucepan. Place the chocolate chips in a small mixing bowl and pour the coconut milk on top. DON’T touch for 3 minutes so it has a chance to warm the chips. Then stir gently until smooth. Microwave or set over a double boiler briefly if the chips didn’t fully melt.Spoon 1/2 Tbsp amounts of ganache over the cheesecakes and swirl with a toothpick or knife.Sprinkle 3/4 of the peanut butter cups on top of the cheesecakes and press down slightly.Cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze until firm - at least 3 hours.To remove from muffin tin, simply pull on tabs at the same time and the cheesecakes should release. Otherwise, use a butter knife to pop them out.

644,Healthy Carrot Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Carrot Apple Muffins (Vegan + GF)

We recently took a tripto Portland, Oregon where I visited several of our favorite bakeries and coffee shops. Perhaps my favorite is Crema–home of the biggest, fluffiest, most perfectly sweet zucchini muffin I’ve ever had.
Since I’ve already mastered the art of the Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake (&lt;- OMG have you tried it yet?), I wanted to venture into the land of carrot cake. This recipe would certainly work as a cake, but I wanted to go the healthier route that didn’t require frosting.
Muffin tin, loaf pan, cake pan: Whatever route you choosethis 1-bowl, vegan, gluten-free recipe is going to blow you away! I literally couldn’t stop eating these(always a good sign).

The recipe starts with some of nature’s best sweeteners: Banana, apple and carrot.
You can either use applesauce or grated sweet apple (a tip I got from a friend). I’ve tried both and they work well. Plus, it replaces some of the oil toprovide plenty of moisture.

Top these muffins with crushed walnuts for an extra kick of healthy fats, protein and Omega 3 fatty acids.
In an ideal world I would eat a handful of walnuts every day; sometimes on top of a muffin, sometimes in granola, sometimesstraight from the jar. It doesn’t always happen but it’s a personal goal of mine. Can’t get enough of these nutrient-packed nuts.

Not only do these muffins require just one bowl, they’re also vegan and gluten free and surprisingly healthy!
The only exception to the “healthy” label is the brown sugar (which I don’t mind in reasonable amounts). But if you’re looking to keep this recipemore natural, I’ve included muscovado (an unrefined brown sugar) as a substitution suggestion.

You’re going to love these wholesome, fruit- and veggie-packed muffins. They’re
Tender and light
Fluffy
Golden brown
Perfectly sweet
Loaded with carrot and apple
Wholesome

Keep these muffins on hand for a quick, on-the-go breakfast or snack. I love packing these when we’re going on trips instead of having to buy super sugary and processed alternatives.

When you press on the top it shouldn’t feel too spongey, so don’t be afraid of over baking! The GF blend just takes longer to bake.Remove from oven and let set in the pan for 15 minutes. Then flip on their sides still in the pan to let cool completely.If you try to unwrap them too quickly, they have a tendency to stick to the wrappers.Once cooled, store in a covered container or bag at room temp to keep fresh.

This is my kind of soul food.
The kind that’s fresh, filling, and loadedwith flavor. And that doesn’t make you feel like crap afterwards. Now that’s (healthy) livin’.
I’ve made spring rolls before(&lt;- yes, we have a cookbook!) but never with such an abundance of flavorfulcomponents and herbs.
Typically I leave my tofu raw, but not this time. I gave it a crispy edge by dredging it in cornstarch and sautéing it sesame oil. Then, I tossed it in my savory almond butter dipping sauce and gave it another flash “fry” in the pan.
The result was a tender, slightly crispy, perfectly seasoned tofu that’s waybatter than raw without being too complicated.

Another new component is the dipping sauce.
Typically, Vietnamese spring rolls come with a vinegar-based sauce, but, sorry no. I just can’t pass up the opportunity to whip upa creamy nut-based sauce. They’re just way more savory, satisfying and sexy.
I love a good peanut sauce for spring rolls, but because peanuts can be a li’l hard to digest I went with almond butter as the base. Still so good and perfectly savory and sweet. What’s not to love?

These rolls are simple, fresh and filling. Inside you’ll find:
Super thin rice noodles
Mint
Cilantro
Red pepper
Carrot
Cucumber
&amp; Crispy almond butter tofu
And to take them from tasty to awesome, servethem with a fat serving of almond butter sauce. Who can resist?

Remove from skillet and set aside.Prep veggies and prepare almond butter sauce by adding all sauce ingredients except water to a small mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Add enough hot water to thin until a pourable sauce is achieved. Adjust flavors as needed (I often add a little more chili garlic sauce and brown sugar).To add more flavor to the tofu, transfer ~2.5 Tbsp of the sauce to a small bowl and add an additional Tablespoon each of soy sauce, sesame oil and brown sugar or agave (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)  and whisk to combine.Add tofu back to the skillet over medium heat and add “sauce/glaze,” stirring to coat. Cook for several minutes or until all of the sauce is absorbed and the tofu looks glazed, stirring frequently (see photos). Set aside with prepared veggies and vermicelli noodles.To assemble spring rolls, pour very hot water into a shallow dish or skillet and immerse rice paper to soften for about 10-15 seconds.Transfer to a damp cutting board or damp towel and gently spread out edges into a circle. It may take a little practice, so don’t feel bad if your first few attempts are a fail!To the bottom third of the wrapper add a small handful of vermicelli noodles and layer carrots, bell peppers, cucumber, fresh herbs and 2-3 pieces of tofu on top (see photo). Gently fold over once, tuck in edges, and continue rolling until seam is sealed.Place seam-side down on a serving platter and cover with damp warm towel to keep fresh. Repeat until all fillings are used up – about 8-10 spring rolls total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Serve with almond butter sauce and sriracha or hot sauce of choice. I like to mix mine and go dip happy.Leftovers store well individually wrapped in plastic wrap, though best when fresh."
646,Vegan Portobello Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Portobello Pizzas

Pizza. I could eat it e’eryday. But, then I would probably turn into a big pizza, which is not what I want out of life.
Thankfully, there’s a solution. I can reserve My Favorite Vegan Pizza for weekends, The Best Ever Gluten-Free Pizza for Tuesdays, and this lovely mushroom pizza pie for Thursdays.
You see? It’s not every day. It’s like every other day. That’s different, and therefore, totallyacceptable. #itsscience #rhondadontask

I really did want to make portobello pizzas because I have a thing for mushrooms and wanted to make pizza night a bit more wholesome and plant-based.
Even though pizza with traditional crust is fine, especially when laden with lycopene-rich tomato sauce and loads of veggies and nutritional yeast, it’s still like eating bread. This was my (ultimate pizza) cheat.
And guess what? While it’s not a 1:1 pizza swap, it’s a lovely change of pace.

So what does it taste like?
Savory
Tender with a bit of bite
Pizza-esque
Loaded withtomato sauce (the best part)
Crunchy from the veg
Perfectly “cheesy” from the vegan parmesan
Fresh
Wholesome
Satisfying
&amp; Not like you’re eating a loaf of bread.
Win-win! If you make this pie, you should probably take a picture and tag it #minimalistbakeron Instagram. If you do, it would make me so happy. If you don’t, it would make me so sad.
So, make me happy. OK? OK. Good talk. (Cheers!)

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Place cleaned mushrooms on a baking sheet and lightly drizzle both sides with a little olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, basil, and oregano. Then bake for 5 minutes.In the meantime, prep veggies and prepare pizza sauce if you haven’t done so already.Once par-baked, pull mushrooms out of the oven and top with desired amount of pizza sauce, veggies, and a sprinkle of vegan parmesan.Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the veggies are mostly cooked.Serve with fresh basil, red pepper flake and extra vegan parmesan."
647,Super Seedy Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Seedy Granola Bars
 Have you ever made granola bars that wereso good you couldn’t stop eating them? Yeah, these are those granola bars.  I have been loving making variations of our Healthy 5-ingredient Granola Bars. They’re so simple, quick and satisfying, I can’t help but dream up new flavors. Chocolate Chip Almond Butter? Yep. Healthy Brownie? Uh huh. Super Mega Seedy? Yeah, this is happening.  It starts with seeds, and lots of them! Seeds are an essential part of a plant-based diet. They’re like little nutritional powerhouses.

For instance, flax and chia seed are incredibly high in fiber and healthy fats, including Omega3s.
Sunflower seeds are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and selenium – nutrients that protect virtually every square inch of our bodies.
And hemp seeds – the healthiest of the bunch– are a complete protein, loaded with Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, and contain all 19 essential amino acids, which are essential foroptimum health.

What’s not to love about these bars? Oh, and I didn’t even talk about the oats and nuts! So many nutrients.  These bars get their sweetness from two sources: dates and agave nectar – two sweeteners found in nature that I love using in place of processed sugar whenever possible. The combination of the two not only provides an irresistibly sweet bite, but also acts as the glue that holds it all together.  My favorite part about making these? You get to use your hands and feel like a kid again. I love using my hands to mix the wet with the dry ingredients. Even though my hands are a sticky mess afterwards, it’s so worth it. Look at these beauties!  You’re going to love these bars. They’re:
Oaty
Nutty
Hearty
Crunchy in all the right places
Perfectly salty-sweet
Loaded with good-for-you ingredients
MEGA seedy
Satisfying
&amp; Ridiculously delicious
 These bars are perfect to make ahead of time for snacking when you’re shorton time. I like to keep a batch in my freezer in caseI have to run out the door andknow I’ll be hungry later. Please tell me I’m not the only childless person who packs snacks for outings? Please?
If you make this recipe, be sure to let me know in the comments! Or, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. I want to know if it’s love at first bite (which, I suspect it will be). Cheers! 
","Toast your oats and almonds in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 13-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown.Process dates in a food processor until small bits remain (about 1 minute). It should form a “dough” like consistency (mine rolled into a ball).Place oats, almonds and dates in a large mixing bowl. Add seeds and set aside.Warm agave and peanut or almond butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir and pour over oat mixture and then mix, breaking up the dates to disperse throughout. Use a spoon or your hands to thoroughly mix.Transfer to an 8×8 dish or other small pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily. (Or use 2/3 of a 9×13 // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)Cover with parchment or plastic wrap and press down with something flat, such as a book, to get them really packed tight. This will help them from being crumbly. Chill in the fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes to harden.Remove bars from dish and chop into 10 even bars (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. I kept mine in the freezer to keep them extra fresh, but it isn’t necessary."
648,Vegan Lemon Asparagus Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegan Lemon Asparagus Pasta

I think you become an adult when you start making your own pasta sauce. Oh, and paying your own bills. That’s also important.
I don’t remember exactly this happened for me, but it was one of the best decisions I’ve made in the kitchen.I used to liveonjarred pasta sauces (and vending machine food) inmy college years, so I was elated and pleasantly surprised tolearn how easy it isto make it from scratch.
This creamy white sauce is no exception.

This pasta was inspired by one of my favorite roasted veggies: Asparagus!
I love asparagus. Ithas the most amazing flavor when roasted, and is even delicious raw! Plus, it’s good for you. These little guysare packed with vitamin C, K, and folate, and are an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich food. And don’t forget the fiber! Seriously people, eat your greens with every meal.

This pasta is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and 30 minutes!
The sauce is adapted from my Creamy Vegan Garlic Pasta(which can be made gluten-free), andcomes with an extra punch of flavor from fresh lemon juice. The lemon and roasted asparagus marry perfectly together in this dish to create aflavor combination I can’t get enough of.

You must make this dish! It’s
Creamy
Light
Satisfying
Simple
Lemony
Savory
Loaded withveggies
&amp; Perfect for a quick-but-healthyweeknight meal
The beautiful thing about this pasta? Leftovers are a dream. So be sure to make extra to pack for lunches during the week. If you’re anything like me, leftover pasta is a welcome mid-day treat when you don’t feel like cooking.

Enjoy this recipe! And if you do, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I love seeing what readers are cooking up. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Add asparagus to a baking sheet and toss with 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch each salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // alter if adjusting batch size). Top with several thin slices of lemon and bake for 20-25 minutes. Once finished cooking, remove from oven and roughly chop into thirds.In the meantime, bring a pot of water to a boil and salt generously.While the water’s heating, bring a large skillet to medium heat. Once hot, add 3 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and garlic. Whisk and continue cooking for 1-2 minutes or until garlic is just starting to brown.Add 3 Tbsp flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and whisk. Cook for 30 seconds, then whisk in almond milk 1/2 cup at a time. TIP: Use a large flat spatula to smash down the bits of garlic and flour to properly incorporate. Add a healthy pinch salt and pepper and whisk. Slightly lower heat and continue cooking to thicken, stirring occasionally.Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package instructions. Then drain and set aside.For extra creamy sauce, add sauce to a blender or use an immersion blender to blend. Add nutritional yeast and another pinch of salt and pepper. If it looks runny, add remaining flour (or cornstarch). Blend until creamy and smooth, using the “puree” or “liquify” setting if possible. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, then add back to pan and continue cooking over medium to medium-low heat to thicken.Once your sauce has reached desired thickness, add the juice of half a lemon and stir.Add 3/4 of the chopped asparagus and the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat.Divide between 2-3 serving plates (per original recipe // adjust if altering batch size) and top with remaining asparagus. Serve with a lemon wedge and vegan parmesan cheese.Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to a few days."
649,Healthy Chocolate Chip Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chocolate Chip Blizzards
To blizzard or not to blizzard, that is not the question.
The question is: Which flavor blizzard to make?
Last week I put out a little SOS vote on Instagramasking what flavor I should make: chocolate or banana cream pie.
A tonof you banana lovers spoke up,but you couldn’t drown out the cries of the chocolate lovers. So, chocolate it was! But not to worry because I also made a banana version that’s comingsoon as well! Everybody wins.

First, chocolate.
This recipe is simple to make and requires just 7 ingredients. It’s slightly adapted from my Vegan Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream, which was before my cashew-in-dairy-free-desserts discovery. Thus, I did a little ingredient switcheroo, added some mini chocolate chips and I had a blizzard on my hands!

The ingredients you’ll need are:
Cashews
Coconut milk
Vanilla extract
Cocoa or cacao powder
Agave nectar
Cane sugar
&amp; Mini chocolate chips (or another mix-in of choice)

The result? Dreamy, creamy, chocolatey bliss. You’re going to love this blizzard! It’s
Creamy
Thick
Mega chocolaty
Perfectlysweet
Spoonable
Studded with chocolate chips
Seriously satisfying
&amp; Perfect for sharing
This recipe makes enough for two generous (or four small) blizzards, so modify the ingredient amountsas you see fit! And if you just aren’t a blizzard fan (BOOOOO), you could just freeze it into ice cream for a more traditional, scoopable ice cream.
Winning idea: It would be perfect for a blizzard party! Call all your friends, prepare this delicious chocolate blizzard base, then providea lineupof mix-ins: Bananas, chocolate chips, M&amp;Ms, peanut butter cups, cooconutwhip, oreos, etc. You get the idea! Then everyone can mix in their favorite toppings and finallybe happy. This summer heat beckons for cooling offwith cold treats. Do it!

If you try this blizzard, be sure to snap a pic and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see what flavor combos you dream up. Cheers!

","The night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill. Also, make sure you soak your cashews overnight OR the next day for at least 6 hours. Be sure to drain before adding to blender.Add all ice cream ingredients EXCEPT chocolate chips to blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Use the “liquify” or ""puree"" setting if you have it. You want it to be completely creamy and blended.I started with lesser measurement of sugar (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and went up from there. If you like it less sweet and more intensely chocolatey, the agave (or maple syrup) should get you there.Chill mixture in the freezer for 1.5-2 hours, or in the fridge overnight. If you don't have an ice cream maker, see notes.Add chilled mixture to ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve.Once the chocolate ice cream is thick like soft serve, add in the chocolate chips and churn for another 1-2 minutes to incorporate.For a true blizzard experience, spoon directly into 4 small serving glasses (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), top with coconut whipped cream and cocoa powder or chocolate shavings.Alternatively, transfer mixture to a freezer safe container, cover and freezer until firm - about 4-6 hours.Set out for 15-20 minutes before serving to soften. Will keep for up to 1 week, though best when fresh."
650,Vegan Omelet | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Omelet

If you’re vegan, I’ll take a wild guess that eggs were one of the last thingsyou struggled to give up. That and ice cream.
Although I’m not 100%vegan, I do eat a mostly animal-free diet and I’d like to continue finding ways to fuel and satisfy my body on a plant-based diet.
I grew up loving eggs and ate them most mornings into adulthood. Unfortunately, a couple of months ago, John and Igot a nasty case of food poisoning that left me with zero appetite for eggs. As in: none-point-none.
Now that we’re fully recovered and our appetites have mostly normalized, eggs have started to sound goodagain. But I’d like to see if I can get my egg fix elsewhere.

I had a random internal dialogue that went something like this.
“Hmm, eggs are good.
I wish there were vegan eggs.
Never tried a tofu scramble. Maybe I should do that.
Ooh, a vegan omelet! Yep, I’m doing that.”
I did a little research on vegan omelets and a few great cooks have mastered the basic technique and paved the way for me to make my own interpretation of this delectable dish.
My7-ingredient base starts with silken tofu – creamy, blend-able, and full of protein. Then flavor is added from hummus, nutritional yeast, sauteed garlic, and paprika. Sautee veggies add extrafiber, nutrition, and texture.
Even though it doesn’t look likeeggs before cooking, the finished result is nearly identical to the real thing!

How do they compare in flavor? Pretty spot on. Someone would probably guess it wasn’t eggs, but it wouldn’t be thatobvious. I personally love this omelet and am thankful it’s a legitimate alternative to the real thing!
What to expect:
Slightly crisp on the outside
Tender on the outside
Fluffy
Savory
Satisfying
A beautiful golden hue
Stuffedwith sauteed veggies
&amp; Packed with nutrition (22 grams of protein!)
If you’re on the fence about eggs but still love a good omelet or scramble,this is the recipe for you. I will gladlybe hoppingon the tofu omelet bandwagon without looking back. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Prep veggies, drain and dry tofu, and mince garlic. Set aside.Heat a small-to-medium, oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes or until just lightly golden brown.Transfer garlic to food processor, along with remaining omelet ingredients (tofu – cornstarch) and mix to combine, scraping down sides as needed. Add just a touch of water to thin – 1-2 Tbsp at most. Set aside.To the still-warm skillet over medium heat, add a bit more olive oil and the veggies. Season with salt and pepper and sauté to desired doneness. I like to start with onions and tomatoes, then add mushrooms, and end with spinach so each has proper time to cook. Set aside.Remove skillet from heat and make sure it’s coated with enough oil so the omelet doesn’t stick. Add back 1/4 of the veggies and spoon on the omelet batter, spreading it gently with a spoon or rubber spatula, being careful not to tear or cause gaps. The thinner and more evenly you can spread it the better. So you may not end up using it all.Cook over medium heat on the stove top for 5 minutes until the edges start to dry. Then place in oven and bake until dry and deep golden brown – 10-15 minutes. The longer it bakes the less soft/wet it will be, so if you prefer a more “well done” omelet, cook closer to 15 or more.Using an oven mitt, in the last few minutes of cooking carefully add remaining veggies back on top of the omelet and cook another 1-2 minutes to warm through.Carefully remove from oven with oven mitt and fold over gently with a spatula. If it doesn’t want to fold, you can serve it as a frittata or scramble!Serve with desired toppings. I went with salsa, vegan parmesan cheese, cilantro and toast."

652,Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream

Cookie dough. Who doesn’t want some? (Rhonda, if you raise your hand one more time, I swear…)

I’ve been on quite the ice cream kick lately…well, for the last 27 years.
Before completely dropping dairy last year I was having ice cream at least once a week. Hello Dairy Queen twist cone with sprinkles (&lt;- the best).
Now that it’s officially summer and I’m off dairy but still craving the sweet, creamy stuff, I just have to make it myself! And when it turns out this good, I’m totally OK with that.


This ice cream is so simple, requiring no fancy methods and just 10 ingredients! Likely items you already have on hand too, especially if you’re vegan or dairy free.
If you were to tour my pantry at any given time, you’d likely find multiple cans of coconut milk, lots of raw cashews, and an eggplant or two. You never know when you need to whip up a dairy-free pasta or dessert.


In addition to requiring simple ingredients, it’s also fast to make!
Once blended, simply chill your batter for 1 hour in the freezer and then add to an ice cream maker. While it’s churning, whip up your cookie dough. In the last few minutes, throw in the dough! It’s super easy and SO worth your time.


Look at that creamy goodness. And once you freeze it up, it somehow gets even more delicious. You’re going to loveit. It’s
SUPER creamy
Perfectly salty-sweet
Decadent
Studded with chocolate chips
Loaded with peanut buttercookie dough
Seriously satisfying
&amp; Perfect for sharing or smooshing between two chocolate chip cookies
What? Who said that…
If you’re a fan of peanut butter cookie dough, and you’re the type that will never turn down ice cream, this is the recipe for you. It’s begging to be made and kept in your freezer this summer.
Even if you’re not dairy-free, if you have vegan or dairy-free friends they would love you for making this for them. It’s like a hug in a cone. Trust me. I ate one and it totally felt like a hug (maybe better).


I don’t have to sell you on this anymore. MAKE this ice cream! And if you do, please take a pictureand tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram or Twitter. It kinda (always) makes my day when you guys make our recipes. Cheers!

653,Simple Vegan Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Favorite Vegan Pizza

Ahh, pizza night. A thing to be cherished.
Around our house we eat pizza at least once a week. And if something horrific happens midweek (say, we run out of Netflix shows), it’s pizza night on Wednesday, too. Because life is short and we love our pizza and we intend to eat it. Often.

One of my greatest struggles since going completely dairy-free has been giving up my beloved veggie pie.
I’m not even that bigof a cheese fan, but pizza just wasn’t pizza if there wasn’ta thick layer of mozzarella and a little parmesan on top. Ya know?
But, the constant feelings of discomfort it would bring made itnot worth it to me. So we reassessedour weekly pizza routine and decided to start making all of our pizzas at home – one without cheese for me and one with cheese for John.

Thank goodness for me there is a 1-minute, homemade alternative to parmesan cheese. Vegan parmesan! Have you tried it?
If not, you must. Even if you’re not vegan you’ll love it – it’s that good. You better believe I go through about 1 shaker-full every couple weeks now. It’s like gold around this house!

Even though I’ve been making a variation of this pizza for a while now, a recent discovery has madeit 10x better.
Sauteedveggies!
My friend Lisa – who shared the genius 5-Minute Microwave Hummus idea with me – used this method for a pizza she maderecently and it kind of blew my mind how good it was.
I was using raw veggies before that never entirely get cooked while the crust is baking. Plus, sauteing them allows for another wave of flavor as I add a sprinkle of pizza seasoning, garlic powder and sea salt. So soft, mega flavorful and delicious.

In our 4+ years of marriage, John and I have eaten a lot of pizza together. At least 208 pizzas, if not more. So I’d like to think ofmyself as somewhat of an expert. This really is – in my opinion – the best pizza I’ve had – vegan or not! Big claims around here, but I know my stuff.
I hope you enjoy this pie! If you make it, be sure to snap a pic and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram or Twitter. Do it! I love seeing what you lovelies cook up. Cheers!

Cook until soft and slightly charred – 10-15 minutes, adding the mushrooms in the last few minutes.

Transfer to jar and refrigerate to keep fresh.Roll out dough onto a floured surface and transfer to a parchment-lined round baking sheet. You’re going to add the pizza WITH the parchment directly to the oven to properly crisp the crust, so any round object will do as it’s not actually going into the oven (I use a wood board).Top with desired amount of tomato sauce (you’ll have leftovers, which you can store in a jar for later use), a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and the sautéed veggies.Use the baking sheet to gently slide the pizza directly onto the oven rack WITH the parchment underneath. Otherwise it will fall through.Bake for 17-20 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.Serve with remaining parmesan cheese, dried oregano and red pepper flake.

654,Vegan Sticky Buns | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The World’s Easiest Sticky Buns

The sticky bun. So elusive. So majestic. So, sticky.
How do you make them? Is there a glaze? Is there a complicated technique? Is it wizardry?
Just a few of the thoughts I had before attempting these beauties. However,I’m elated to reportthat if you can master my World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls(and you totally can),you can master the World’s Easiest Vegan Sticky Buns, too!

It all starts with a simple dough that rises in 1 hour.
To keep things a little on the healthier side, I went with a 2:1 mix of unbleached all purpose and whole wheat pastry flour for slightly-hearty-but-still-decadent roll.
You could alsogo entirely all-purpose for true bakery style, all whole-wheat pastry for a healthier roll, orsome other combination that I haven’t thought of! I suspect part spelt flour would work swimmingly.

So how are these simple? I’m glad you asked.
9 ingredients (pecans being the 9th and optional ingredient)
One truerise=less waiting
Fool-proof methods
No fancy techniques or equipment involved
See? You can totally do this.Believe it.

If you’re wondering how these sticky buns get their ooey-gooey glaze, it’s simple:
From a simple brown sugar, vegan butter mixture that you spread in the bottom of the baking dish.
Then you add pecans and your unbaked rolls and bake until fluffy and golden brown. Wait a few minutes, invert the pan, and voila! You have bakery-worthy sticky buns that will mystify your friends and family as to how you made them. Go you.

So what do these studs taste like? Amazing. They’re
Soft
Tender
Fluffy
Sweet
Perfectly spiced
Sticky
Cinnamon-y
Loadedwith pecans
&amp; Better with each bite

I could hardly stand taking photos of these rolls. Look at them! I wanted to inhale the whole batch and forgo photographs altogether. But I managedto hold off 30 minutes for pictures before I delighted in one from the center of the batch.
If you’ve ever eaten a cinnamon roll or sticky bun, you know it’s kind of like unwrapping a treasure. You start from the outside and work your way in until you get to that last, sticky center bite that undoubtably has the most sugar and butter.
Savor that bite, friends. Savor it like it’s never going to happen again. Then repeat! These rolls are simply amazing and so easy to make. DO IT.


If you give these a go, let me know how you liked them! And be sure to snap a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. It makes my day when I see you guys making and enjoying ourrecipes. Cheers!

","In a large sauce pan (or in a bowl in the microwave at 30 sec increments), heat the almond milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 110 degrees (43C), or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes, then add sugar and the salt and stir.Next add in flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring as you go. The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball, adding more flour as you go and as it will absorb. Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with avocado oil or other neutral oil, and add your dough ball back in. Roll around to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.While dough is rising, prepare sticky glaze by mixing butter and brown sugar and spreading it in an even layer on the bottom of an 8x8 baking dish (adjust if altering batch size). Top with pecans and set aside.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Brush with melted vegan butter and top with brown sugar (or granulated sugar) and cinnamon.Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in your 8x8 dish with the glaze layer on the bottom (you should have about 10 rolls as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Cover with plastic wrap and set on top of the oven to let it briefly rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees (176 C).Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes, carefully invert, and then serve immediately."

Just as much as it’s not summer without pool days, it’s not summer without a good pasta salad.
Usually the things are laden with heavy dairy products, but not this one! It’s completely dairy-free and loaded with the perfect combo of crispy veg. Pasta heaven in a bowl.
Plus, it comes with a VIDEO!



If you enjoyed this video, be sure to check out my first one for Vegan Chai Ice Cream. I’m getting really into the video/editing process and having a blast doing it. So stay tuned for more in the near future!

So, back to the salad.
It’s simple, requiring just 30 minutes start to finish and just over 10 ingredients (depending on what spices you go with). The result is a light, fresh pasta salad with a tofu-based dressing that no one would ever guess was dairy-free. And the veggies? Perfectly crisp and uber colorful. Classic macaroni salad made vegan – ’nuff said.
Where might you take this pasta salad? A barbecue, a summer shindig, a lake day, a picnic, in yo lunch, camping… You get the idea. Make this salad and take it with you everywhere this summer. Cheers!

","Cook noodles according to package instructions, drain, and set aside.Chop veggies and set aside.Prepare dressing by adding silken tofu, dill, salt, pepper, garlic powder, agave nectar (or sugar), vinegar, oil, and spicy mustard to a blender and blending until well combined. Scrape down sides as needed. If having trouble blending add water in Tablespoon amounts until it has enough liquid to churn properly.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more dill, mustard, salt and agave.Toss drained noodles and veggies with the dressing in a large serving bowl. Chill for at least 1-2 hours before serving. The flavors will meld and the salad will thicken up the longer it chills.Serves 8 (as original recipe is written). Store leftovers in the fridge for up to a few days."
656,Gluten-Free Vegan Banana Pecan Shortbread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Banana Pecan Shortbread (Butter-Free)

It’s cookie time! Vegan, gluten free cookie time no less.

I have marveled at shortbreads for some time now, fearfully admiring their elusive technique and distinct texture/flavor profile. For some reason I doubted I’d ever be able to conquer such a feat as mastering the shortbread, but I was wrong.
Making shortbreads is EASY. Easier than most cookies, in fact. And making them vegan and gluten free AND without butter is even easier. You can trust me – I’m still kind of a cookie novice in the baking world. Pancakes and ice cream are more my game.
These cookies fit the minimalist bill requiring just 7 simple ingredients, and they require just one mixing bowl and one baking sheet. Not bad for a seriously scrumptious, crispy, banana-infused cookie!

These cookies are lovely. They’re:
Crispwith a slighttenderness
Infused with banana
Subtly coconutty
Studded with pecans
Perfectly sweet
Charming
Delectable
Sturdy and portable (perfect for gifting + traveling)
&amp; Highly shareable
As far as I’m concerned, these banana cookies are near perfection. I love that they have a slight bite with the perfect amount of tenderness, how the pecans toast up nicely to add a rich nuttiness to the overall flavor profile, and how how the banana isn’t overpowering. (And bonus, they don’t require butter, eggs or traditional flour!)
Hope you enjoy these beauties as much as I did. Cheers!

You know the drill. If you make these cookies – or any recipe from the blog – be sure to snap a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I love to see what you loveliesare cooking up. xo!

Freeze for 15 minutes to harden.Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 C).Unroll paper and slice cookies into slightly less than 1/2 inch discs with a sharp knife. If the dough has become too hard, let it rest for a few minutes at room temp to soften. If it’s too soft, freeze longer.Place on an un-greased baking sheet. They won’t spread much, so they can be placed close together.Bake for 18-22 minutes or until light golden brown."
657,Baked Sweet Potato Tater Tots | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Baked Sweet Potato Tater Tots

If you love sweet potato fries, you will LOVE these easy baked sweet potato tater tots. Or as I like to call them, Sweet Potater Tots. (Insert: laughing crying emoticons.) Plus, 7 ingredients – huzzah!

So I’ve tried to make sweet potato tater tots before and it didn’t work out. They either weren’t flavorful enough or the texture was off. And I wasn’t about to fry them, so back to the drawing board I went. This time, success!

The secret here is the panko bread crumbs,which I seasoned namely with salt, sugar and cinnamon. It gives the tots a crispy outer crust with tons of flavor.

The next essential step is baking them until they’re golden brown and slightly crisp. The longer you bake, the crispier they’ll get. It’s magic.

The result is kind of perfect. These tots are:
Crispy on the outside
Tender on the inside
Perfectly sweet
Subtly cinnamon-y
Like sweet potato fries crammed into a tot
&amp; Kind of perfect
You could make these to serve alongside sandwiches orveggie burgers, breakfasty things, brunch, or on their own with other snacky appetizers like these vegan jalapeno poppers or cotija corn dip!
They’re perfectly poppable and sweet and I kind love them. Hope you will, too. Cheers!

","Poke holes in the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven for 45 minutes – 1 hour until softened, OR in the microwave for about 5-6 minutes. Let cool to touch.While sweet potatoes are cooking, prepare coating. Add all ingredients EXCEPT butter to a food processor and blend until incorporated. While mixing, stream in butter. Dip your finger in to give it a taste. If you prefer it more savory, add more salt. If you prefer it sweeter, add more sugar or cinnamon.Peel sweet potatoes and add to a mixing bowl. Add cinnamon and mash – you’re not looking for a puree, but rather a rough mash. If your sweet potatoes are already pretty sweet on their own, omit the sugar. Otherwise, add it in and mix.Set in fridge to chill and preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Scoop out scant 1 Tbsp amounts of sweet potato puree and form them into a “tot” shape – an oblong circle.Transfer to coating and use a spoon to gently toss to coat. Transfer to baking sheet and spritz the top with olive or canola oil to help them crisp up (optional).Bake for 20 minutes, then gently flip. Bake for 20 minutes more then serve immediately. If you want them firmer, just bake them an additional 10-15 minutes. The longer you cook them the crispier they’ll get!To freeze and bake later, form into tots, roll in coating, then transfer to baking sheet and freeze. Once thoroughly frozen, add to freezer-safe bag or container to store for later. When ready to bake, place on an oiled baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, flip, then bake for 25-30 minutes more or until they reach the desired doneness.You really don’t need dip for these, but if you want, ketchup or a spicy aioli of some kind would be lovely."
658,Simple Peach Iced Tea | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Perfect Peach Iced Tea

Though I used to despise peaches as a child, I’m quite fond of them now. All it took was one good peach milkshake and my mind waschanged. Ice cream has undeniablepower over me.
This peach iced really is perfect.
I hate to compare it to Sonic’s, because that would mean I would have to admit Igo there. But since the cat is out of the bag, I am fond of Sonic’s unsweetened iced tea with peach and was happy to recreate something so similar at home that was muchfresher and made with ingredients I know and trust.

It starts with peach simple syrup, which has the most insanely gorgeous pink hue. Not to mention, it tastes amazing – likeripe peach liquidcandy. If you don’t want that, you’re wrong.


Once your simple syrup is made, all that’s left to do is brew up your favorite black tea. We prefer loose leaf, but bagged tea is fine too. The main flavorhere is the peach anyway, but quality tea certainly doesn’t hurt.

This peach iced tea is summer perfection. It’s
Perfectly sweet
Mega peachy
So refreshing
Ice cold
Simple to make
&amp; Perfect for hot summer days &amp; BBQs
The beautiful thing is, you can brew theiced tea and keep the simple syrup on hand soeach person can decide how muchthey want to add. Or, you can mixit all together ina tea dispenser for easy serving for parties and such. It really is the perfect summer beverage. Hope you’ll give it a try. Cheers!

","Bring sugar, water, and peaches to a boil in a small saucepan. Then lower heat and use a wooden spoon to stir and crush the peaches to infuse the flavor.Once the sugar is dissolved, cover, remove from heat and let steep for 25-30 minutes.In the meantime, brew your tea using either a large pot or a tea maker. I use this loose leaf tea steeper from IngenuiTEA. NOTE: Use less tea if you prefer it weaker or more tea if you prefer it stronger, and try not to let it steep longer than 4-5 minutes or it can get bitter.Once brewed, remove tea bags or strain out loose leaf tea and transfer to a pitcher. Refrigerate to cool.Once your simple syrup is finished, pour into a bottle or container over a fine mesh strainer to strain out peaches. You can reserve the peaches for later use, such as to place over oats or ice cream sundaes.To serve, either set out simple syrup and add as much to the tea as you like, or add all of the simple syrup to the tea and stir. I prefer leaving it separate. Serve tea over ice and fresh sliced peaches. Recipe as originally written yields about 10 servings (with ice and peaches)."
659,Microwave Hummus Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Best Ever 5-Minute Microwave Hummus

A few weeks ago I went to a friend’s bridal shower where we all pitched in toprovide a handsome spread of food and drink. I was on wine and smoothie duty and my friend Lisa made the hummus.
I’ll be honest: Iwas expecting was another standardhummus that was good but didn’t taste as good as restaurant-style.
What I wasn’texpecting was to eatsome of the best hummus of my life. For reals. Ready for this recipe? I’m SO excited to share it with you!

A few bites in whenmy mind finally wrapped around what my mouth was tasting, I turned to Lisa and asked how she made it.
Lisa: “Well, I started with a can of chickpeas and microwaved itwith garlic…”
Me: “Wait, why microwave?”
Lisa: “Hey, Idon’t know these things, this is just how it’s done.”
Me: “OK, KEEP GOING.”
She explained it was a recipe from her brother- and sister-in-law who were both amazing cooks and caterers on the side.
The concept is to cookthe garlic cloves in with the chickpeas (liquid and all) so it gets SUPER creamy and takes on a extra garlicky flavor. It also seems to meld all of the flavorstogether a bit more to give it an ultra luxurious finish.

Microwave before and after. See the difference? It may seem subtle, but the flavor/texture pay off is MAJOR.
The other kicker? 1/2 cup tahini. HALF CUP. Just trust me. Best hummus ever.

Once your chickpeas and garlic are microwaved, add straight to a food processor or blender with your tahini, lemon juice, sea salt and a bit of olive oil. Then whirl until creamy and smooth and prepare yourself for themost insanely delicious hummus of yo life.

Though this hummus comes together in 5 minutes, it’s going to be hot! So, I recommend making it ahead of time and refrigerating it so it gets even more thick and the flavors can meld together.
I don’t know how arefrigerator can make this diptaste 13x better, but it just does. Trust me.

You guys are going to LOVE this hummus! It’s
Ridiculouslycreamy
Rich
Thick
Perfectly seasoned
Savory
Smooth
Slightly lemony
Garlicky

Serve with pita bread and/or chips, veggies, or just a spoon. Seriously, I would just eat this with a spoon. Make this now!

","Microwave undrained chickpeas and whole garlic cloves in a mixing bowl for 4-5 minutes.Add to blender or food processor and process with lemon juice, salt and tahini. Stream in olive oil while mixing.Process until smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as you prefer. I found 3/4 tsp of salt to be the perfect amount (amount as original recipe is written // refer to the lower end of range if altering batch size).Garnish with a little more olive oil and paprika, and serve with veggies, crackers and pita. Leftovers keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or more. It tastes even better refrigerated, as it has time to thicken up and develop in flavor."
660,Bourbon Caramel Vegan Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Salted Bourbon Caramel Ice Cream

Is it possible to accidentally make bourbon caramel? ‘Cuz that’s what I did. Either way, it made this ice cream taste BOMB. Lez do this.

This recipe started because I knew I was making my Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp and I wanted some ice cream to serve it with. One problem though:store-bought dairy-free ice creams are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced and you only get like 2 tablespoons. Obviously, I had to make my own.
The flavor I wanted to go for was bourbon vanilla. Myfirst attempt turned out more like a slushythan it did ice cream. Waaaa. Back to the drawing board.

Round 2 was a total success! I accidentally made bourbon caramel whilst trying to cook down the bourbon so it would allow the ice cream to freeze. SO amazing! Even though it subdued the taste of the bourbon, the addition of the caramel note was mind blowing, so we’re rolling with it!
This ice cream requires just 9 ingredients and is super simple to make! It’s cashew-based with a heavy touch of full fat coconut milk. It’s infused with bourbon caramel two ways: once in the base and a second time with a last minute swirl while it’s churning. So amazing.
The result? The creamiest, dreamiest vegan ice cream of your life.

This ice cream is perfect for fruit crisp, boozy milkshakes, sundaes and more. It’s
Creamy
Perfectly sweet
SO smooth
Subtlyinfused with bourbon
Caramel-y with a touch of sea salt
Mega satisfying
And just kind of perfect
Serve plain or as we did, with this Vegan Gluten Free Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp. Such an amazing pairing. This would also go well with apple pie. Apples + Bourbon = heaven. Enjoy!


","The night before, place your ice cream churning bowl in the freezer to properly chill. Also, make sure you soak your cashews overnight OR the next day for at least 6 hours. Be sure to drain before adding to blender.Add bourbon and cane sugar to a small saucepan over medium-high and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to simmer and swirl DON’T stir, until a bubbly caramel forms. It happens pretty quick; less than 10 minutes so stay close. Remove from heat and immediately add 3/4 of the almond milk (3 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), sea salt, and stir. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, taste and add more salt if needed. You could also add a splash more bourbon at this point, but don't exceed 2 tsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) or it can inhibit it from freezing.Add all ingredients except bourbon reduction and tapioca flour to blender and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Use the “liquify” setting if you have it. You want it to be completely creamy and blended with no chunks.Add tapioca flour and HALF of the bourbon caramel and blend again. Chill remaining half of caramel.Add mixture to ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions - about 45 minutes. It should look like soft serve.Add remaining bourbon reduction in last minute OR stir in with a spoon so there's a more pronounced swirl.Transfer to a freezer-safe container and cover well. Freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm.Set out for 10-20 minutes (OR microwave for 30 seconds) before serving to soften. Will keep for up to 1 week, though best when fresh."
661,Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp

Quick, before summer turns everyone’s house into a sauna, turn your oven on and make this crisp!


This is the ultimate lazy girl’s crisp. It’s rustic and fuss-free and utilizes fresh OR frozen fruit, whatever you happen to have on hand. It also requires just 8 ingredients total and is entirely vegan and gluten free. Huzzah!


The magic begins by adding your fruit to a buttered baking dish and tossing with a bit of sugar. Because we’re using rhubarb and raspberry – two relatively neutral and tart fruits – I find this step essential. Otherwise the fruit will lack some flavor and that sweetness you’re going for with a crisp.

For the crisp topping, we’re working with oats and nuts! This recipe is adapted from my Nectarine Strawberry Crisp – another must try this summer. Almond meal, crushed pecans and rolled oats make up the base while vegan butter (or olive oil) bring moisture and brown sugar a touch of sweetness.
Into the oven it goes for 45 minutes to 1 hour and it’s ready! Invite friends over immediately and dig in.


This crisp is perfect for summer. It’s
Packed with fruit
Perfectly sweet
Hearty
Slightly Tart
Nutty
Studded with oats
Simple and fuss-free
&amp; Healthy enough for brunch or a late-night dessert
It’s also extremely customizable. If you don’t have pecans, sub walnuts or extra almonds. If you don’t have vegan butter, sub olive oil. And if you can’t get your hands onrhubarb or raspberries, use whatever summer fruit you can get your hands on (blueberries and blackberries would be a lovely combo).

Of course, what would a crisp be without ice cream? Tune back in this weekend for yet another ultra creamy, entirely vegan ice cream recipe that’s going to blow your mind. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and butter an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish.Add fruit directly to the dish and toss with sugar (1-3 Tbsp depending on preference // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add crisp ingredients to a mixing bowl and, using your hands or a pastry cutter, mix until all of the butter is evenly distributed. Add to the top of the fruit in an even layer.Bake for 45-55 minutes or until the fruit is bubbling and the top is crisp and golden brown.Let cool for 10 minutes and serve with dairy-free ice cream or coconut whipped cream.Leftovers will keep in the fridge for several days, though best when fresh."
662,Healthy Chocolate Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Brownie Granola Bars

Hello friends! How was yourweekend? Awesome, I hope.
John and I did somerelaxing, brunching, pizza-ing, and working on a new food photography product.I also bought and returned a pair of overpriced yoga pants out of sheer buyer’s remorse. Does that ever happen to you? Sometimes, we just have to make mistakes like that in life.
It’s been a week since I’ve eaten ALL of these granola bars, but I’m still dreaming about them and peekingin the freezer to make sure I didn’t overlook one last piece. They’re that good.

These brownie granola bars kind of started out as a failure. The idea was to make date-sweetened brownies and I resorted to adapting my go-to Vegan GF Black Bean Brownies. Problems ensued. I ate one and had to throw the rest away. Not good. Not good at all.
Back to the drawing board.

In life do you ever find yourself trying to fita square peg in a round hole? That’s what I was doing with these brownies. I wanted date-sweetened brownies but the blog universe was telling me something different.
When I’m trying to fit my square recipe into a round hole, I rethink it. The result was a simple, naturally-sweetened, healthy granola bar that was a little on the decadent side – just the way I like it.

These bars DO indeed taste like a raw brownie.
They require just 7 ingredients.
They’re no bake, aside from toasting your oats and nuts (an optional step).
They’re loaded with antioxidants, fiber, protein and healthy fats.
They’re incredibly satisfying.
They’re perfect for breakfast, dessert or a quick snack.
They’re freezer-friendly.
They’re uber chocolaty.
They’re really just kind of perfect.

So what do they taste like? Supreme awesomeness. They’re
Rich
Dense
Moist
SUPER chocolaty
Nutty
Oaty
Slightly crunchy
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Mega filling
I did have one for breakfast and found it quite filling. But for the most part I ate these as a healthy dessert. I’d go to the freezer, break off 1/3 and snack. Thenrepeat for the next 30 minutes until it was gone. Self control comes in waves, people, especially with these bars.

You MUST try these bars and let me know what you think! Tag a photo (#minimalistbaker) on Instagram or @minimalistbaker onTwitter so I can see how lovely yours turn out. Happy brownie making!

","Optional step: Toast your oats and pecans in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 15 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Otherwise, leave them raw – I prefer the toasted flavor.Process walnuts in a food processor until a loose meal is reached. Remove from bowl and set aside.Add dates and process until small bits remain (about 1 minute). It should form a “dough” like consistency. (Mine rolled into a ball).Add walnut meal and cocoa or cacao powder back in with the dates and process to combine.Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and add the (toasted) oats and nuts and stir to combine. You may have to use your hands to really incorporate the mixture well.Next, warm honey and almond butter in a small skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until combined and pourable. Pour over brownie mixture and then thoroughly stir using a wooden spoon. (I opted to put plastic bags on my hands and mix that way to better incorporate the mixture.)Once thoroughly mixed, transfer to a 9×13 dish (or similar size pan // adjust if altering batch size) lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily.If using a 9x13, ONLY USE 3/4 of the pan so they have the proper thickness. Otherwise they’ll be too thin. Cover with parchment or plastic wrap and press down firmly to even out the top. Freeze for 15-20 minutes to harden.Lift bars from pan and chop into 12 even bars (or more if you prefer). Store in an airtight container in the freezer or fridge to keep them extra fresh. They will get a little sticky when left out at room temp."
663,Strawberry Rhubarb Pop-Tarts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Strawberry Rhubarb Pop-Tarts

Yep, it’s happening. A rhubarb invasion on the blog. Prepare yourself.


When planning out recipes for the month of June I was plotting many ways to feature rhubarb. It’s such a curious plant and I just had to employ it.
Myfirst memoryof having rhubarb was during a road trip I took with my friend Ashley years ago. After touring 7 states we landed at her parents’ house in rural Idaho where their garden was abundant with the stuff.
While Ashley’s mom made us dinner one evening, her dad baked a pie: strawberry rhubarb. It was so delicious I knew I had to get my hands on some and try it for myself.

The funny thing about rhubarb is, it’s elusive. It doesn’t peek its head until late April, early May and only remains seen for a certain stretch of summer. Which is why I was anxious to get my hands on some come spring. Well, after multiple phone calls to area grocery stores and failed attempts at picking some up at markets, I finally spotted some and when I did, I stocked up.
Consider this the first of at least two rhubarb recipes in June if not more.

So these pop tarts.
They’re amazing.
They’re made with whole grain pastry.
They’re flaky and perfectly sweet.
They’re loaded with rhubarb and strawberry compote.
They require 7 ingredients.
They’re vegan.
They’re adapted from my VeganBerry Pop Tarts (a must try).
They don’t need frosting but, why not? Life is short.

You simply must try these pop tarts. They’re the perfect way to celebrate summer fruit and indulge in a little something sweet.
If you do, snapa picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. You guys know I love it when you show me what recipes you’re making from the blog. So get to baking and then get to Instagramming.Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Prepare the compote by placing rhubarb, strawberries, raw sugar, and orange juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and smashing down with a spoon to muddle the fruit together. If it bubbles too much, turn down to low heat. Transfer to a bowl to cool.In a large bowl, mix flour and salt, then cut in butter with a fork or pastry cutter until well combined.Drizzle ice cold water over the mixture in 1 Tablespoon amounts and mix with a wooden spoon until it starts to form a dough. It usually takes about 2-3 Tbsp, but you may need to add up to 5 Tbsp (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). It should be moist enough to form into a ball, but not too sticky to handle. Add more flour if it gets too wet.Turn onto a floured surface, gently shape into a disc, and then use a floured rolling pin to roll into a large rectangle. I find it helpful to place a sheet of plastic wrap over the dough while rolling to reduce cracking.Cut into 16 equal squares (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and carefully transfer to a baking sheet. My first attempt, I got 12 squares. Then I rolled out my scraps and got four more!Place about 1 Tbsp of the fruit filling onto half of the squares, leaving a 1/4 inch border to seal the edges. Then use your finger to run water around the edges so the two squares stick together. Top the squares with their matching halves and then seal lightly with a fork.Poke a few holes in the top of each pop tart, brush with a bit of melted vegan butter, sprinkle with raw sugar (optional), and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.Let cool and then top with glaze if desired. To prepare glaze, simply whisk together melted vegan butter, powdered sugar and add juice 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. The glaze is not necessary, but recommended for sweeter pop tarts.Store leftovers in a covered container at room temp for up to a few days."
664,Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Peanut Tofu &amp; Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry
One bite in and I knew I hit the jackpot with this one. If you’ve been in search of the perfect crispy, baked tofu recipe, this is the onefor you! I’m so excited to share this with you guys I can hardly stand it. Let’s do this!
For starters, this dish is served overcauliflower “rice” instead of regular rice because 1) Cruciferous veg for the win, and 2) You can eat an ENTIRE head of cauliflower instead of 1/2 cup of rice and STILL only consume a fraction of the calories and carbohydrates, so why not?!
Cauliflower rice is SOsimple and you absolutely must try it! It doesn’t passcompletely as rice since the textures and flavors are slightly different. But it looks just like rice and in my opinion, tastes even better as it absorbs the sauce perfectly and takes WAY less time to cook.
You guys know the deal: My favorite way to crisp up tofu is pre-baking it before sauteing – a little trick I picked up at a vegetarian cafe in San Antonio (Yes, I hounded the waitress for the technique – you’re welcome). This gives it that crisp outer edge and perfectly tender center.
Once your tofu is baked, add it to your sauce, which acts as an all-in-one marinade and sauce for the cauliflower rice, veggies and for serving! It wears many hats and it’s oh-so delicious and Thai-inspired.  Once your tofu is marinated, it’s ready for a quick stir fry to give it that perfectly golden brown, crisp, mega-flavorful coating. Then all that’s left to do is saute up your veggie of choice – baby bok choy for the win – and your cauliflower rice!
All in all this dish takes around 1 hour 30 minutes, which is a little longer than I prefer. But the pay off is so worth it! Plus, it only requires 9 ingredients – many of which you likely already have on hand.  You’re going to love this dish! It’s
Savory
Satisfying
Super Peanut-y
Perfectly sweet
Not-too-spicy
Loadedwith flavor
Packed with veggies
Entirely vegan + gluten-free (with GF soy sauce)
&amp; Perfect for a night in
I made this dish and ate half, then reheated the leftovers the next day and I swear it got better! I love it when that happens.Hope you enjoy this dish as much as I did. Cheers!

","Begin by draining tofu 1.5 hours before you want your meal ready. If your block of tofu is larger than 12 ounces, trim it down. You don’t need a full pound for this recipe (see notes).Roll tofu in an absorbent towel several times and then place something heavy on top to press. I use a pot on top of a cutting board and sometimes add something to the pot to add more weight. Do this for 15 minutes.Near the end of draining, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cube tofu. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. Bake for 25 minutes to dry/firm the tofu. Once baked, remove from oven and let cool.Prepare sauce by whisking together ingredients until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I often add a little more sweetener and peanut butter.Add cooled tofu to the sauce and stir to coat. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes to saturate the tofu and infuse the flavor.In the meantime, shred your cauliflower into rice by using a large grater or food processor. You don’t want it too fine, just somewhat close to the texture of rice. Set aside. Mince garlic if you haven’t already done so, and prepare any veggies you want to add to the dish (optional).Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat (6 out of 10), and if adding any veggies to your dish, cook them now in a bit of sesame oil and a dash of soy sauce. Remove from pan and set aside and cover to keep warm.Use a slotted spoon to spoon tofu into the preheated pan. Add a few spoonfuls of the sauce to coat. Cook, stirring frequently for a few minutes until browned. It will stick to the pan a bit, so don't worry. Remove from pan and set aside and cover to keep warm.Rinse your pan under very hot water and scrape away any residue. Place back on oven.Add a drizzle of sesame oil to the pan, then add garlic and cauliflower rice and stir. Put cover on to steam the “rice.” Cook for about 5-8 minutes until slightly browned and tender, stirring occasionally. Then add a few spoonfuls of sauce to season and stir.Place cauliflower rice and top with veggies and tofu. Serve with any leftover sauce. Leftovers reheat well and will keep covered in the fridge for up to a couple days."

The minute I discovered you canmake queso without cashews, I was convinced cashew-less mac ‘n’ cheese had to happen. Eggplant cheese sauce seriously knowsno bounds.


I’ve made vegan mac ‘n’ cheese before using a cashew-based sauce and it really was amazing! But the issue with cashews is that they make recipes so heavy with their high fat and calorie content. Not that I’m a calorie counter, butI’m all for lightening up recipes whenI can.
Eggplant sauce to the rescue.

This eggplant sauce is so simple to make – just a 10-minute roast before peeling the skin and adding it to the blender. It’s infused withnutritional yeast, garlic powder and sea salt for that ultimate cheesy, savory flavor. I could’ve eaten that sauce all by itself, but the noodles were calling…

The thing that sends this mac ‘n’ cheese over the top is the caramelized onions and the crispy breadcrumbs!
While the sauce and noodles meldperfectly together, the addition ofcaramel-y, browned onions and crispy bread crumbs on top sends the flavor profile through the roof! I could’ve eaten this whole pan by myself – no lie.

You’re going to love this dish. It’s
Creamy
Comforting
Warm
Cheesy
Super saucy
Savory
Satisfying
Slightly crisp on top
&amp; Totally share-worthy
Make this for vegan and non-vegan friends alike and watch their jaws drop after the first bite. It’s just that good!

","Slice eggplant in slightly less than 1/2-inch rounds (but not quite 1/4 inch – ruler for reference) and sprinkle both sides with sea salt. Place in a colander in the sink for 20 minutes to drain moisture and draw out any bitter taste.In the meantime, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add olive oil and the onions. Cook 10-12 minutes – stirring every few minutes. Turn down the heat if browning too quickly. Once caramelized, place in a bowl for later.Preheat oven to high broil and place an oven rack on the very top rack.Start pasta water by bringing a large saucepan 3/4 full of water with 1 Tbsp salt to a boil.Rinse eggplant and dry thoroughly. Arrange on a baking sheet in a single layer and drizzle both sides with olive oil. Broil on high for 3-4 minutes on EACH side until the eggplant is browned (be careful not to burn, just seriously roasted).Remove eggplant from oven and wrap in foil to steam for 5 minutes. Then peel off skin and add to a blender with almond milk, nutritional yeast, cornstarch and garlic powder. Start with a pinch of salt and add more as you need.Blend until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt, nutritional yeast or garlic powder if desired.Once pasta water is boiling, add noodles. Cook according to package instructions, then drain and cover with a towel to keep warm.Pour the eggplant sauce into the same saucepan you used to brown the onions and bring to medium heat. Cook to thicken for about 5 minutes. Once bubbling, lower heat to low/simmer and stir occasionally until noodles are ready.If topping dish with breadcrumbs, heat a small saucepan over medium-high heat and add olive oil or vegan butter. Than add breadcrumbs and stir. Cook for about 5 minutes until light brown and toasted. Set aside.Add drained noodles to the eggplant sauce in the large saucepan, along with half of the caramelized onions and stir to coat. NOTE: If your saucepan is NOT oven safe, transfer the mixture to an oven-safe dish at this time.) Smooth the top with your spatula or spoon and top with remaining caramelized onions and the toasted panko bread crumbs.OPTIONAL: Preheat oven to high broil once more and move an oven rack to the 2nd level from the top. Once hot, place macaroni under the broiler to toast for 1-2 minutes or until golden brown on top. BE CAREFUL not to burn as it can go fast. Don’t walk away.Remove from oven using an oven mitt and serve immediately. Leftovers don’t tend to reheat well with this dish as the noodles absorb the sauce. Best when fresh."
666,Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream Cake

If you’re one of those (few) people with mass amounts of self control, you were able to save yourVegan Mint Brownie Ice Cream until today! Phew, that was rough. How did you do it?
Here’s what I propose we do with that creamy, minty, dream boat ice cream: MAKE AN ICE CREAM CAKE!

I’ve loved ice cream cake since I was a wee little Minimalist Baker. I mean, cake AND ice cream? Come on.
But I haven’t had itsince my dairy sensitivity really flared up last year and said, “Hey, lady, stop that. Dairy makes you feel like crap.”
Fine, body. Although you’re right, you’re still a giant party pooper.

This ice cream cake is made with our 1-Bowl Vegan Chocolate Cake! It’s the perfect chocolate cake for vegan newbies and skilled bakers alike because it requires just one bowl, no fancy ingredients, and comes together in about 1 hour. Plus, it’s mega delicious. Read the comments.
While your cake is baking and cooling, you can get on making your ice cream (if you haven’t already done so, champ).

Once your cake is cooled and your ice cream is softened, it’s time to build that cake.
You can do so in two ways (probably more). Basically you’re just trying to layer the cake and ice creamin as uniform fashion as possible. I went with a loaf pan for easy sculpting, but you could also use a cake stand and just frost the cake with the ice cream like “frosting.” If you do this, you’re fancy and I’m jealous of your skills.
The best part is, it doesn’t have to be perfect or even pretty because it tastes AMAZING.

You guys are going to LOVE this cake. It’s
Fudgy
Creamy
Chocolaty
Sweet
Perfectly minty
Studded with fudgy brownie bites
Mega satisfying
&amp; Perfect for sharing
Do you have a birthday? Yes, you do! (I know you do. You’re lying, RHONDA.)
May I suggest something? Make this cake for yo’ birthday! Or make this pie, I mean, come on. Either way, make this cake! Cheers, friends.

P.S. You know the drill. If you make this cake (or just inhale the ice cream on its own), let me know! Tag your photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram so I can see. It makes my day, seriously. (Why wouldn’t you want to make my day, Rhonda?)

","You can either bake your cake in two small round cake pans OR in a 9x13 and cut it in three even rectangles.Once your cake is cooled, soften your ice cream for 10-15 minutes at room temp, or briefly in the microwave.FOR A ROUND CAKE: Lay down your first layer of chocolate cake on a serving plate or cake stand and top with half of the ice cream. Smooth with a spoon, trying to keep the layer even and smooth. Top with second layer of chocolate cake and press down gently. Top with other half of ice cream and ""frost"" the cake with it. You can either frost it all the way around or just on the top. It doesn't have to be perfect. Cover and freeze for at least 1 hour. Before slicing leave out for 20-30 minutes to soften.FOR A RECTANGLE CAKE: Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and lay down your first layer of chocolate cake. Then top with half of your mint ice cream and smooth with a spoon. Repeat twice, ending with cake on the top layer (which will actually be the bottom once inverted).Cover and freeze for at least 1 hour. Before slicing leave out for 20-30 minutes to soften.I had some leftover raw brownie from the ice cream recipe, which I used to top the cake. This is optional."
667,Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegan Mint Brownie Ice Cream

Where do I even start?
Perhaps by telling you this is the creamiest, dreamiest mint ice cream you’ll ever feast on. And that it’s loaded with raw brownie chunks. YES, brownie chunks. No wimpy chocolate chipshere. Oh, and that it’s entirely vegan and gluten-free.
Whoo, that wasa mouthful, but you need to know it all!

I used to despise minteverything, especially desserts. Mint belonged in fluorideand toothpaste as far as I was concerned; nowhere near my ice cream.
But then, one night at my aunt’s house, I was offered a piece of chocolate cake and the only ice cream availablewas mint chip. OK, fine. If it’s the only option. I was desperate.
I hate to admit it, but, I fell in love.

This ice cream is based loosely on my chai ice cream(Which has a video, by the way. Have you seen it!?).
It’s cashew-based, which makesit ultra creamy and thick. Coconut milk gives it an ultra velvety finish and pairs perfectly with the fresh mint.
If you love mint, you’re in luck because this ice cream gets its minty-ness from twosources: fresh mint leaves and peppermint extract. I don’t mess around.

While your ice cream is churning, make your raw brownie.
This is the most bare bones raw brownie recipe you can make: dates, raw nuts(I love a mix ofraw walnuts and almonds), and cacao or cocoa powder (although cocoa makes it not technically “raw”).
Mix it all together and then form it into a little brownie brick and let it chill while your ice cream gets all soft serve like. Try not to eat it all (important).

Yes! The moment has come to add the brownie.
You don’t need toadd it all, unless you really want to. But I like the emphasis to be on the ice cream with bites of brownie in most every bite. Plus, then I can snack on leftover brownie brick the rest of the week (huzzah!).


Friends! This ice cream is a dream. It’s:
Creamy
Smooth
Cold
Minty
Perfectlysweet
Velvety
Studded with raw brownie bites
Chocolaty
Luscious
&amp; Altogether irresistible
Make it for yourself or share it with friends! OR, exercise the utmost self-control and save it for a killer recipe I have coming up for you guys this weekend! Stay tuuuuuned.

If you make this recipe, yo, let me know. Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Or tweeter it to me. I love seeing what you lovelies cook up. Cheers!

","Set your churning bowl in the freezer the night before to chill. Soak your cashews the night before as well, or for at least 4-6 hours before blending.OPTIONAL STEP: When ready to prepare ice cream, steep HALF of your fresh mint leaves in the coconut milk. Bring the coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan and add the mint leaves, then turn to low. Use a wooden spoon or muddler to puncture the mint so it infuses the coconut milk. Keep on low for 15 minutes, then kill heat and let cool. Once cooled, strain out the mint leaves using a fine mesh strainer and pour the coconut milk right into a blender. (If not doing this step, just add all of the fresh mint and coconut milk right into the blender. The flavor won't be AS strong, but it will still be delicious.)Add remaining ingredients, including DRAINED cashews and remaining fresh mint (vanilla extract is optional) and blend until creamy and smooth - about 3-4 minutes, using the ""liquify option"" if you have it. Taste and adjust sweetness/minty-ness as needed.Add mixture to your chilled ice cream maker bowl and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions until thoroughly chilled, about 45 minutes. It should resemble thick soft serve (see photo).While churning, prepare your raw brownie by processing dates in the food processor until small bits remain - it will likely form into a ball. Remove and set aside.Add nuts and process until small bits remain, then add back in dates and cocoa or cacao powder and process until well combined (see photo).Transfer to a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper and use hands to form into a ""brick"" shape. Set in freezer to chill.Once ice cream is done churning, break off chunks of your brownie and stir into the ice cream. I used about 3/4 of my brownie.Transfer ice cream to a freezer-safe container, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Will keep in the freezer for up to one week, though best when fresh.Before serving, let thaw on the counter for 10-15 minutes to soften."
668,Greek Salad with Wheat Berries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mediterranean Wheat Berry Salad

John and I eat Mediterranean food at least once a week, oftenin the form of a hummus snack plate for lunch. It’s so simple, healthyand satisfying, andit’s something we always agree on.
Beyond whipping up hummus and falafel,my Mediterranean/Greek food skills werelacking. It was time for that tochange.

A few years ago when we were still living in Portland, I accompanied a friend to afarmers market where I experienceda Greek wheat berry salad that kind of changed my life.
Well, that’s dramatic.
But I remember it was one of the first meals that proved to meyou really don’t need meat or gobs of peanut butter to fill you up. The idea to recreate that salad at home stuckwith me, and I’m so glad it finallysurfaced.

You’re going to love this simple salad. It’s hearty, customizable year-round, and requires just 10 ingredients including the simple Greekdressing.
It all starts with wheat berries – a whole grain that’s nutty with a slight chew and loaded withfiber, vitamins and minerals.

Next come roasted onions and leeks, baby tomatoes, kalamata olives, and a 5-ingredient savory Greek dressing.

It all meldstogether to create a seriouslyhearty, flavorful Greek salad perfect for lunch, dinner or a snack. The wheat berries provide chew and heartiness, the roasted veggieswarm things up andadd a comforting touch, and olives andtomatoes keep itlight and fresh.

Serve this salad asis or with your favorite add-ins. I enjoyed mine withgarlic hummus and pita chips. You could also throw in some fresh greens for more nutrition.
Took me right back to the farmers market where I inhaled my first Mediterranean wheat berry salad out of a paper cup in the summer sun. Good memories. I hope you make this salad and enjoy it much as I did. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Then add salt and wheat berries and reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and continue cook for 25-30 minutes or until tender. They should be chewy but not tough.Drain and add to a large serving bowl. Add 2 tsp olive oil and a pinch of salt for added flavor (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Prep leeks and onions, then place on a foil- or parchment-lined baking sheet and toss with 1 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch each salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Bake for 23-28 minutes or until tender and golden brown. Toss halfway through for even cooking. Set aside.In the meantime, prepare dressing by combining all ingredients except olive oil in a small mixing bowl. Stream in olive oil as you whisk to emulsify. Otherwise, add all ingredients to a jar and shake vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Add tomatoes, olives, roasted leeks and onions to the wheat berries and toss with enough dressing to coat. You’ll likely have leftover dressing.Serves 4 generously (as original recipe is written). Cover and refrigerate to keep for up to several days. The longer it sits and marinates, the more intense the flavor becomes.Additional garnishes might include hummus, pine nuts, parsley and pita chips."
669,Peanut Butter Mousse Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter Mousse Cups

This recipe came from another late-night revelation just before drifting off to sleep. “PEANUT BUTTER MOUSSE CUPS! John, don’t let me forget this one.” It must be so oddbeing married to a food blogger…

You guyslovedmy 3-ingredient peanut butter mousse, which acts asthe filling for these dreamy, chilled 5-ingredient peanut butter cups.
I’ve made peanut butter cup pie, peanut butter cup pancakes, peanut butter M&amp;Ms, and peanut butter eggs before, but this takes my chocolate-peanut butter obsession to a whole new level.


It starts with a dark chocolate shell, which is chilled before getting plumped up with coconut whipped cream infused with salted, natural peanut butter and a little powdered sugar.

You can top these guys two ways: Totally covered with chocolate for a classic PB cup look, or lightly drizzled with chocolate so there’s less mystery as to what’s inside. No matter which way you go, you can’t go wrong with the combo of chocolate + peanut butter.


So what do they taste like? Heaven! They’re
Creamy
Cold
Chocolaty
Peanut Buttery
Not too sweet
Indulgent
Ice-creamy
Mousse-y
&amp; Perfection in PB cup form

","Chill a large mixing bowl for 5 minutes in the freezer. Remove lid from coconut milk can and carefully scoop out the cream. Reserve any clear liquid for other uses (smoothies, baking, etc.). Beat for 30 seconds, then add powdered sugar and whip again. Last, add peanut butter and stir well. Refrigerate.Melt chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30-second increments. Once melted, stir in coconut oil.Arrange 14 mini (or about 7 standard // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) paper muffin liners in a mini muffin tin or on a plate. Spoon in about 2 tsp of melted chocolate and use a brush or small spoon to coat the liner with chocolate almost all the way up the sides (see photo). Refrigerate for 10 minutes to set.Spoon in 1 Tbsp amounts of peanut butter mousse and pat on the counter to release air bubbles and flatten the tops. Freeze for 10 minutes.Drizzle or completely cover the tops of the cups with the remaining chocolate (you may have some leftover).Place back in the refrigerator to set once more. Once thoroughly chilled, cover and store in the refrigerator for up to one week. Pop in the freezer for longer term storage."
670,Summer Berry Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Summer in a Cup Smoothie

I recently helped throw a bridal shower for a friend and it was the host’s brilliant idea to have a smoothie baralong with gourmet s’mores arounda fire pit. Best, shower, ever.
I was selected as the smoothie recipe generator, so I offered up a few variationsthat were made into recipe cards for the guests to follow. This recipe for Summer in a Cup was one of them, which just so happened to be a total fave among guests.
If you like berries, citrus and sweet-creamy smoothies,this is the recipe for you.

It starts with frozen banana and loads of frozen raspberries. This provides a cold, creamy-thick base, as well as a sweet-tart flavor contrast. Next comes unsweetened Almond Breeze almond milk, orange juice and pomegranate juice for the perfect mix of creamy, sweet and tart.
This smoothie truly is summer in a cup.

What’s it taste like?
Mega creamy
Cold
Perfectly sweet
Not too tart
Refreshing
Citrusy
&amp; Satisfying
Of all of the smoothies I’ve made (and I’ve made a lot), this is definitely one of my favorites to date!
If you want, add a handful of greens for extra nutrition (although it will likely turn it a not-so-flattering hue). Add silken tofu for a protein boost.

If you make this smoothie – and you totally should – take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see what you come up with! Cheers and happy (almost) summer!

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. Add more milk or fruit juice if too thick. Add more frozen banana if not sweet enough. Serve immediately. Freezes well (or make into Popsicles)."
671,Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups with Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing

A few weeks back John and I went to my sister’s house for dinner. We can all agree on Mexican food, so taco salads it was.
Salsa and sour cream are obvious toppingsfor traditional taco salads, but for something dairy-free I went witha creamy cilantro-lime dressing that I made up on the spot. It was so good I was inspired to make this recipe and douse it in the stuff. Green gold, I call it.
If you’re in the marketfor a satisfying vegan and gluten free appetizer or entree, this is the recipe for you.

The whole thing comes together in about 30 minutes and is madewith some seriously healthy eats:
Spiced,Roasted Sweet Potatoes
Quinoa
Black Beans
Dark Leafy Lettuce
Avocados
Limes
Cilantro
&amp; Olive Oil

While your sweet potatoes and quinoa are cooking, whip up your dressing!
It requires just 6 ingredients and is SO creamy and flavorful. Avocadoprovidesplenty ofhealthy fat, fiber and a little protein, and makes the texture super creamy. Flavor comes from sea salt, lime juice, cumin, agave and cilantro. Olive oil adds more healthy fat and a velvety finish.
This stuff is so dang good, and it makes about 1 cup worth! So keep leftovers in a jar for other salads and Mexican dishes throughout the week.

Next comes assembly! Simply arrange your lettuce on a plate and top with quinoa, black beans, roasted sweet potatoes, and a bit of the cilantro-lime dressing.

John and I split these for lunch and polished the plate!
They’re so light, flavorful and healthy, yet entirely satisfying. If you have vegan or vegetarian friends, they’ll definitely love you for makingthese. But I think they’re fillingenough to please even hearty meat eaters.
If you give them a shot, let me know! Take a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. I’d love to see! Cheers.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and prep sweet potatoes. Toss in a drizzle of olive oil and 1/4 tsp each cumin, cinnamon and sea salt (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Bake for 20-25 minutes or until tender and slightly golden brown.Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and place in a small saucepan over medium-high heat to toast. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes and then add 1 1/2 cups water and stir (amount as original recipe is written // use a 1:2 ratio quinoa:water if altering batch size). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes or until tender and the water is fully absorbed. Turn off heat and set aside.In a separate saucepan, bring black beans to a simmer over medium heat and season with 1/4 tsp each sea salt, cumin and cinnamon (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If your black beans are already salted, omit additional salt.

Add water to thin and scrape down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lime, salt, cumin or sweetener as desired. Transfer to serving dish. You will have leftovers, which store well in a covered container in the fridge for up to several days.Rinse and dry lettuce (or sub corn or flour tortillas) and choose the pieces that are a good “cup” shape to fill with toppings.Arrange on a serving plate and top with quinoa, black beans and sweet potatoes. You might have leftover toppings depending on how many salad cups you prepare. Leftovers keep well.Serve with dressing and any additional desired toppings, such as cilantro, salsa, chips or sliced jalapeno."
672,Mango Green Tea Popsicles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mango Green Tea Pops

Last summer I strucka serious love affair with mangos. They’re so creamy, satisfying and naturally sweet (and super healthy), and lend themselves perfectly tosmoothies, sorbet, and Popsicles!

Yep, it’s about that time. Summer is almost here and it already feels like it in the Midwest. I’ve already started setting my alarm to get up earlyso I can squeeze in my morning walk/run without burning up.
Around thistime I start craving cold things in the morning like cereal and smoothies. And in the afternoon? Ice cream and popsicles is the way to go.

This recipe is super simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 5 ingredients! Mango, matcha green tea powder, coconut milk, agave (or sweetener or choice) and lemon juice.
If you don’t have a popsicle mold, just use my dixie cup and wooden spoon method (works like a charm).
If you’ve never experienced matcha you’re missing out. It’s basically green tea on steroids because it’s green tea leaves ground into edible powder. Hiiii-ya!
When ingested straight instead of diluted tea form, you’re getting more than 10 times the vitamins, minerals, and cancer-fighting antioxidants green tea provides.
NOTE:Not all matcha is created equal!In my experience, the more vibrantthe green huethe better. I found this extensive review by Healthy Happy Lifeextremely insightful. Check it out if you’re in the market for some matcha this summer.

These pops are magic in the mouth. They’re:
Creamy
Cold
Naturally sweet
Slightly tart
Mega fruity
Loaded with health benefits
Totally share-worthy
&amp; Perfect for warmer weather
Enjoy!

","Depending on which layer you want on the top of the Popsicle, prepare that first. I went with green tea.Add coconut milk, matcha powder and agave to blender and blend until smooth. Divide evenly between Popsicle molds – mine makes 6 small pops (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), so adjust as needed.Pop in the freezer to set briefly while you prepare the next layer. This will help them form two distinguished layers that don’t run together.Rinse out blender and add mango, coconut milk, and lemon juice. Blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.Pour over the green tea layer, tap to remove air bubbles, and gently insert Popsicle sticks. Freeze for at least a few hours or until completely set.Remove from molds and enjoy! Store extras in a freezer-safe bag for up to a couple weeks, though best when fresh."
673,Vegan Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuits | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuits

I don’t crave biscuits often, but when I do I want one that’s serious:
Super fluffy, buttery and fresh out of the oven. For that, thankfully I have my go-to Best Damn Vegan Biscuit. But a girl has to have more than one biscuit recipe in her arsenal if you ask me, so I went back to the drawing board.

I’ve been on a bit of a nutrition yeast kick lately and have been putting it on everything, especially pizza and pasta. And if you’ve been reading Minimalist Baker for a while now, you know I adorespicy food. So it was natural to wantto try my take on a cheddar jalapeño biscuit.
I’m happy to report that the result was a massive success. These little golden gems are the real deal!

It starts with your basic dry ingredients plus nutritional yeast! That’s what gives it that amazing yellow color and cheesy flavor.
The rest is simple: Mix your dry ingredients while your vegan buttermilk activates,thencut in your vegan butter or coconut oil. Next, stir in your jalapeños andadd your buttermilk and stir. Form into a disc, cut and butter! That’s it – the whole process takes about 10-15 minutes.
And the result is so worth it: A beautiful, buttery, tender biscuit just asking to be devoured.I mean, come on…look at these guys.

These biscuits are legit! They’re:
Buttery
Warm
Savory
“Cheesy”
Fluffy
Tender
Slightly spicy
&amp; Perfect with a little vegan butter and maple syrup (What? Who said that…)
Make these for a special weekend brunch or slow breakfast or alongside your favorite soups or summer grilled items. I can’t wait to make these for some unsuspecting cheese-lovingfriends. I think they’ll be totally oblivious to the fact that these are completely dairy-free. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Add lemon or vinegar to almond milk to activate/curdle.Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl.Add cold butter and use fingers or a pastry cutter to combine the two until only small pieces remain and it looks like sand. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm. Then add jalapeños and toss.Make a well in the dry ingredients and, using a wooden spoon, stir gently while pouring in the almond milk mixture 1/4 cup at a time. You may not need all of it. Stir until just slightly combined – it will be sticky.Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with a bit of flour and then very gently turn the dough over on itself 5-6 times – hardly kneading.Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible.Use a 1-inch thick dough cutter or a similar-shape object with sharp edges (such as a cocktail shaker or drinking glass) and push straight down through the dough, then slightly twist.Repeat and place biscuits on a baking sheet in two rows, making sure they just touch – this will help them rise uniformly.Gently reform the dough and cut out one or two more biscuits or until all of the dough is used– you should have 8-10 (as original recipe is written), depending on the size of your cutter.Next brush the tops with a bit more of melted non-dairy butter and gently press a small divot in the center using two fingers. This will also help them rise evenly, so the middle won’t form a dome.Bake for 10-15 minutes or until fluffy and slightly golden brown. Serve immediately. Let remaining biscuits cool completely before storing them in an airtight container or bag. Will keep for a couple of days at room temperature."
674,Vegan Stuffed Mushrooms | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Stuffed Mushrooms
 Gold-dusted nutrition bombs. That’s what you need to know.  These mushrooms. They’re stuffed! They’re vegan! They’re gluten-free! They require 7 ingredients, and they’re SUPERyummy. I mean, come on. Anything with vegan parmesan gets 5 gold stars in my book.  It all starts with black rice, the nutritional superstar that boasts more anthocyanin antioxidants than blueberries, and is loaded with iron and fiber. Hubba, hubba. Next comes walnuts, and we all know how high in healthy fats and protein and omega-3s they are. I try to eat a few every day! Plus, they add a nutty,hearty bite to the black-rice filling. And last but not least, vegan parmesan, which acts as a salty, “cheesy,” (secretly healthy) topping, and crust that sends the flavor of these babies over the top.
Sign. Me. Up.  So what do they taste like? Let me tell you. They’re: Tender with a slight bite Warm Savory Hearty Slightly nutty Mega healthy Light Satisfying Highly shareable And altogetherlovely Invite your friends over for drinks and appetizers and prepare to watchthese mushrooms disappear. So, dang, delicious. Enjoy! 
","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer.Bring veggie stock to a boil in a small saucepan, then add rice. Lower heat, cover and cook until liquid is completely absorbed – anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Taste to sample doneness – if you prefer a chewier, softer rice, cook longer. If you’re OK with more bite, check around the 25-minute mark.In the meantime, place walnuts on a baking sheet and toast in oven for 5 minutes. Set aside.Brush dirt from mushrooms using a damp towel and remove stems. Brush or spray with olive oil and set aside.Prepare parmesan cheese if needed. Set aside.Once rice is done, fluff and then add vegan parmesan cheese, toasted walnuts, minced garlic and olive oil. Stir, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added just a pinch of salt and pepper and a little more vegan parmesan.Bake the mushrooms on a baking sheet WITHOUT the filling for 10 minutes to soften.Remove from oven and scoop generous spoonfuls of the filling into the par-baked mushrooms. (You will have a little leftover filling.) Top with additional vegan parmesan cheese and bake another additional 15-18 minutes or until tender and the parmesan is golden brown. (Baking the mushrooms on their own helps prevent the rice from getting too crisp.)Serve immediately. TIP: Dust your serving plate with vegan parmesan cheese so the bottom of the mushrooms have plenty of flavor, too."

If you follow me on Instagram, then you know we were in California last week driving down the coast, hunting redwoods, sipping wine, and meeting Billy. It wasn’t all just for fun, although we did havea blast. We were in San Franciscofilming a course all about food blogging! And guess what? It’s going to be available soon and we’ll gush all the details when it’s available.
Just know, in the meantime, you’ll get lots of face time with John and me via video. Expect crash courses on food photography, monetization, meaningful growth, and finding a niche.Fair warning, we can be slightly awkward on camera as we’re rather used to the camerabeing turned the opposite direction (wink).

What does this have to do with pie? It all comes together. Trust me.

In California we ate some seriously good food. From San Francisco to wine countryto Humboldt county, we stuffed ourselves silly.
While on vacation I like toseek out bakeries and try their best offerings. I’ve curbed my everyday sweet tooth quite a bitso when I’m traveling I indulge a bitmore.
At Tartine I had one of the best walnut brownies of my life.
At Craftsman and Wolves I had aseriously bangin’ chocolate chip cookie.
At Dandelion we split a chocolate bar that wasso complex I almost cried.
At Downtown Bakery I noshed onone of their world famous sticky buns.
But you know what? Of all the sweets I had last week (and there was obviously a lot), I still swoon for this pie. If you’re a chocolate peanut butter lover, you must give this recipe a go!

It all starts with a creamy peanut butter-tofu filling made light and airy with coconut whipped cream. Pour that over a crispy, sweet graham cracker crust and top it with a vegan chocolate ganache and you’re in straight up vegan paradise.

This pie is outrageously delicious and a smallslice is MEGA satisfying. It’s:
Silky
Creamy
Peanut buttery
Not too sweet
Mega chocolaty
Reminiscent of a giant PB cup
Slightly crispy from the peanuts and graham cracker crust
&amp; Totally irresistible

I could not trust myself around this pie, so you better believe I was passing it off on any friend within arm’s reach. But the great thing is you can store this gemin the freezer and then just take a little bite when you’re craving something sweet.
I froze my pie and then about 30 minutes before serving set it out to get ultra creamy. SO good. When you take one bite and your eyes roll into the back of your head, you know it’s a winner.Enjoy!



","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and lightly oil a standard glass pie pan (8 inches x 1 1/4 inches // as original recipe is written).Add graham crackers to a food processor and process until you achieve a semi-fine meal. A little texture is OK, just remove any large pieces that didn't get ground. Add melted butter and pulse to combine.Add to greased pie pan and press down with your fingers to flatten. You can lay a piece of plastic wrap over the top when pressing down to ensure a more uniform layer. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and set aside to cool.Add tofu, peanut butter, maple syrup or agave to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more agave for added sweetness or a pinch of salt if your peanut butter wasn't very salted.Next, scoop out the cream of your coconut milk or cream and whip into whipped cream in a large, chilled mixing bowl. Find trouble-shooting tips here. Optional: sweeten with a little powdered sugar and vanilla.Fold the peanut butter-tofu mixture into the whipped cream.Pour filling over crust and pop in the freezer to chill. Once it's fairly chilled and slighty firm (about 1 hour), prepare your ganache.Add chocolate chips to a bowl and heat your non-dairy milk to a low simmer. Then pour over chocolate chips and don't touch for 5 minutes to allow it to melt. Then stir gently with a spoon or rubber spatula until a smooth ganache forms. If it doesn't quite melt, you can also heat it in the microwave in 10 second increments until smooth and melted.Spoon over the top of the pie and spread in an even layer with a knife or spatula, working quickly as the ganache will get clumpy if it sets too long.Top with crushed, salted roasted peanuts (optional) and pop back in the freezer to set. 20-30 minutes before serving, remove from freezer and serve. Alternatively, you can chill this in the fridge, but it is much more delicate to slice and serve, but just as delicious.After the initial chill, make sure you cover the pie with plastic wrap to keep it fresh."

If you’ve ever wished you could drink peanut sauce through a straw, this is the soup for you.

Since discovering Thai food years ago (as inauthentic as it may be in my world), I’ve fallen in love. I make Pad Thai for dinner (find our go-to recipe in our 31 Meals Cookbook) several times a month, primarily because we love any and every excuse to douse things in peanut sauce.

679,Vegan Cashew-Less Queso Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cashew-Less Vegan Queso

It always happens. Just as I’m about to drift off to sleep at night, a recipe idea zings into my brain out of nowhere. This time, for vegan queso.

EXCITING NEWS.
I’ve tried vegan cheese based with cashews. It’s good, and it’s the first way I learned to mock cheese texture and flavor without using dairy. But I knew there had to be a better way.
I mean, not that I’m into counting calories, but cashews are very high in calories and fat and you can detect them in sauces unless you really build up the flavor from spices and otherwise.
So, the thought was, “What else is creamy but neutral and would make a good base for cheese sauce?”
The zinger I got at midnight whilst falling asleep: EGGPLANT!

Eggplant is amazingly versatile, especially once roasted. I enjoy it in pastas, whirled into baba ganoush or even roasted and layered into a hearty veggie sandwich. I adore the creaminess of baba ganoush and suspected its eggplant base would make an excellent base for vegan queso.
DING DING DING. I was correct.


This sauce starts with roasted eggplant. I speed up the process by slicing it into thin rounds and broiling. A little steam in foil and then you can pull away the skin with ease. Then, just throw it into a blender with almond milk, nutritional yeast and a handful of spices and you’re good to go.
Look at that creamy queso goodness.

A little cornstarch in the mix helps it thicken up once heated in a saucepan for serving. This is an optional step but I recommend it for that ultimate luxurious cheesy texture. (If you don’t use cornstarch, try another thickener, such as arrowroot powder.)

All that’s left to do is add in a few Tbsp of slightly drained Rotel (just like real queso dip!) or your favorite chunky salsa. This really sends the texture and flavor over the top to mock the real thing.

Oh. My. Word.
You’re not gonna believe how delicious this is. And guess what? HUSBAND APPROVED!
John tried it, and he doesn’t like cashew sauces, and he really liked this dip! We agreed that it was ridiculous how close it was to real queso dip. Seriously amazing!

So what does it taste like?
Creamy
Velvety
Savory
Super cheesy
Slightly spicy
Perfectly dippable
Totally pourable
Begging to be added to all your favorite dishes
Don’t worry. I have a few recipes in the works utilizing this dreamy dip! And another bonus: It reheats extremely well! If you’ve ever made cashew cheese you know it doesn’t exactly reheat well. But with this, you can just pop it in the microwave or put it back in a saucepan and it’s just as good!

Yet ANOTHER bonus? This dip is cashew-, soy-, dairy-, and gluten-free!
And did I mention it’s way lighter in fat and calories than nut- and dairy-based quesos? Just 55 calories and 3.5 grams of (healthy) fat per serving! What’s not to love? Make this dip! And if you do, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so I can see! Cheers!


","Slice your eggplant into thin rounds just under 1/2 inch (not quite 1/4 inch). Then sprinkle both sides of the flesh with a little sea salt and arrange in a colander to help draw out some of the moisture and bitterness. Let set for 10-15 minutes. Then rinse with cool water and thoroughly pat dry between two clean towels.Preheat oven to high broil and place an oven rack near the top of the oven. Arrange the dried eggplant rounds on a baking sheet lightly spritzed with non-stick spray and drizzle both sides of the eggplant with a little olive oil. Sprinkle with a very small amount of salt.Broil on high for 4-5 minutes on each side, watching carefully as to not let them burn. Flip at the halfway point to ensure even cooking. Once the eggplant appears tender and both sides have golden brown color, remove from the oven and wrap loosely in foil to steam.After a few minutes, unwrap and peel the eggplant skin away. It should come right off. If you pack your roasted eggplant into a 1-cup measuring cup, it will be almost 1 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Place eggplant in a blender with almond milk (starting with the lesser amount), nutritional yeast (starting with the lesser amount), minced garlic, cumin, chili powder and cornstarch and blend on high until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a pinch more sea salt and a little more nutritional yeast. To thin, add more almond milk.Transfer to a small saucepan and warm over medium to medium-high heat until slightly thickened and bubbly – about 5 minutes. The longer you go the thicker it will become.NOTE: If it isn’t looking as thick as you want, thicken with a slurry of cornstarch by adding an additional 1 tsp cornstarch to a small bowl with a little almond milk and 2-3 Tbsp of the cheese mixture (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Whisk to combine and then stir back into the pot. This should thicken it right up.Once hot and thickened, remove from heat and stir in DRAINED salsa or Rotel. Don’t put the liquid in or it will make it runny. Pour into a serving dish and top with a little smoked paprika and hot sauce for flavor/color.Serve with chips, crackers or veggies. Keep warm in a mini crockpot or over a tea light warmer if you have one. Microwaves well.NOTE: When this dip sits out for a long time it loses its orange hue. It doesn't affect the flavor but it doesn't look as appetizing, so it's really best when fresh!Refrigerate and cover leftovers. Reheats extremely well in the microwave or in a saucepan. Will keep for up to a few days, but best when fresh."
680,Sweet Potato Dessert Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Superfood Sweet Potato Dessert Fries

Once I discovered the magic that is sweet potato fries years ago, there was no going back. Sure, I still enjoy the occasional traditional fry but I almost always go for sweet. What’s not to love? They’re sweet, perfect with salt, tender, slightly crispy and delicious with just about any dip (ketchup me, please).
That being said, I couldn’t help but take my affection for sweet potato fries beyond savory settings. I kept dreaming about this big pile of sweet potato fries doused in all things sweet. Turns out, this was a good idea. Next girls night I have, I know what I’m making.

Just because these are dessert fries doesn’t mean they’re unhealthy. In fact, they pack in 5 superfoods in their warm, sticky-sweet glory. This is cause for celebration if you ask me.
It all starts with baked sweet potato fries, lightly dressed in olive oil and salt. Then comes the sauce. Peanut butter lovers rejoice!

If you aren’t into peanut butter or just prefer almond, go that route instead. Next time I make these I think I’ll go that route because sweet potato and almond butter are simply meant to be together. But you can never go wrong with peanut butter.
What’s next? Oh yes – DARK CHOCOLATE.

I melted some dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips and poured it on. So seriously good. If you’ve never experiencedsweet potatoes and dark chocolate, you’re simply missing out.

Last but not least? Coconut whipped cream, toasted nuts, and pomegranate arils. Oh mama.

So where do all these super food health benefits come in? Allow me to explain.
Nuts – Nuts are high in protein, healthy fats, fiber, vitamins and arginine, which can help lower blood pressure. Some research has even found that regular consumption of nuts can help you live longer. They also steady blood sugar, lower cholesterol and can help fight dementia.
Sweet Potatoes – Gorgeous sweet potatoes are packed with nutritional benefits. They’re high in vitamin B6, vitamin C (wards of cold and flu viruses and keeps the skin youthful), vitamin D (stabilizes energy levels, mood and promotes healthy bones, nerves, skin and teeth), iron (promotes healthy immune function), magnesium (promotes healthy artery, blood, bone, heart, muscle and nerve function). They’re also high in carotenoids like beta carotene, which helps strengthen eyesight and boost the immune system.
Coconut – Although high in saturated fat, coconut has been found to contain medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently by the body than long chain fatty acids (the kind found in high-fat fried foods and animal products). Coconuts are also high in fiber, vitamins C, E and B vitamins, as well as iron, selenium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.
Pomegranate – Pomegranates are high in B vitamins, potassium, folic acid and iron. Pomegranate juice has been found to help improve blood flow, and their anti-inflammatory properties may help prevent cancer.
Dark Chocolate – Found to possibly decrease stroke risk and lower blood pressure. Dark chocolate is high in fiber and antioxidants, which help prevent cancer and protect skin from UV damage. Regular consumption can also boost your mood, improve blood flow, and even perk up your vision.
Need I say more? You need this big plate of super food dessert in your life.

This is the type of dessert that needs to be eaten fresh! It’s not nearly as delicious once cooled and doesn’t keep well. So invite over a few friends to enjoy these. Otherwise, just slim down the ingredients to suit one – I generally recommend 1 sweet potato per person. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Slice sweet potatoes into even wedges by halving, halving again, then cutting off the pointy wedge into a small “fry.” Cut the remaining wedge in half if it appears too large. Continue until all fries are sliced.Arrange fries over 2-3 baking sheets and toss with olive oil and a healthy pinch of salt. Align in a single layer – you don’t want them overlapping or touching too snuggly or they won’t brown.Bake for 20 minutes, then flip for even cooking. Bake for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown and at the desired doneness.Remove from oven, sprinkle with a bit more salt and a little ground cinnamon (optional), and let cool for a few minutes.To make the peanut butter sauce, simply thin with hot water until pourable. Sweeten with agave or maple syrup if desired (I left mine plain). If your peanut butter is already soft enough, there’s no need to thin it. Just add it as is.To make the chocolate sauce, simply microwave chocolate chips in 30-second increments until melted. Alternatively, use a double boiler to melt. Add a touch of coconut oil to thin if desired to make it more pourable.Arrange fries on a serving platter and drizzle with the peanut butter and chocolate. Top with coconut whipped cream and pomegranate arils and nuts. Dust with more cinnamon. Serve immediately."
681,Vegan Cheez Its | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cheez Its

Either you love Cheez Its or you don’t. If you’re in the camp of total fan girls, this is the recipe for you!

If you’ve ever tried Cheez Its you know how salty and cheesy they are. It’s kind of addictive if you favor savory foods.
Well, the thing is, a little sea salt and nutritional yeast (nutrition diva and flavor bomb) can totally mock that flavor of the real thing without going into dairy land! It’s kind of like magic.

The awesome thing about this recipe – besides the fact that it requires just 8 ingredients – is that it’s quick and considerably healthy!
A mix of flours give a bit more nutritional value (oat and cornmeal + unbleached all-purpose) and instead of going for all vegan butter, I mixed in some olive oil for added nutrition. The nutritional yeast and cornmeal are what give it that vibrant yellow “cheesy” color.

About 15 minutes in the oven and you’re good to go! These taste very close to the original, I’m telling you! John even agreed and he’s a harsher critic than I. I think you’re going to love these; they’re
Salty
Tender
Slightly crisp
Ridiculously cheezy
Kind of addictive
&amp; Highly shareable

I hope you enjoy this vegan knock-off recipe! And if you do try it, be sure to take a photo and post it to Instagram with the hashtag #minimalistbaker. I’d love to see! Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Add dry ingredients to a food processor and process to thoroughly combine.Then add olive oil and/or butter and pulse again until crumbly.Add cold water 1 Tbsp at a time until it forms a loose dough (see photo). You don’t want too much water, so go easy on it and add a little at a time. It shouldn’t need more than 3 Tbsp (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Remove from processor and form into a loose ball with your hands. It’s actually good for this dough to be worked and warmed by the heat of your hands, so don’t worry about touching it too much. However, you are not kneading it, just forming it into a disc.Lay on a lightly floured surface – I found parchment worked great as my flat surface – dust the top with flour, and roll to 1/8th inch thick with a lightly floured rolling pin. Use a knife, pizza cutter or small cut cookie cutter shape to cut the dough into square crackers. Optional: dot the centers with a fork prong or chopstick for more character/resemblance to a Cheez-It.Bake for 12-17 minutes or until puffy and golden brown. These are pretty tender. For a crispier cracker, bake until golden brown. Makes about 70 crackers (as original recipe is written)."
682,Thai Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crunchy Thai Kale Salad

Although we eat dinner together most evenings, sometimes John and I crave different things. It’s no secret that I generally want something healthy and light and he is desiring something a bit more satisfying.
Most nights I can whip up something that’s a compromise – something filling but with tons of veggies like black bean tacos, Pad Thaior pizza. But other nights, we agree to disagree and go our separate ways. And on those nights I usually make a big green salad.

This salad is one that I’ve been making recently when I’m craving Thai food but don’t have time time to make anything complicated. It’s not authentic by any means but certainly Thai-inspired with the peanut sauce, fresh vegetables and tofu.

The whole thing comes together in about 20 minutes, starting with the greens.
I prepare the kale by drizzling it with toasted sesame oil and agave nectar (or honey if not vegan) and massaging to flavor and soften the sometimes bitter, stiff leaves. Then I toss some lightly drained tofu in sesame seeds (a tip I learned from Sprouted Kitchen Cookbook), to give it more texture and nutritional value. If you aren’t into raw tofu (like some commenters have noted) try this easy baking method that gives it a nice bite with no additional ingredients.

Next is the dressing – my favorite part.I use my go-to 5-ingredient peanut sauce that’s the perfect balance of savory, sweet and spice. I love how it adds another layer of flavor to this crunchy, spring salad.

I don’t trust myself around peanut sauce. Whoever said 2 Tablespoons was one serving was a liar.

So easy, so fresh, so delicious. I think you’re going to love this salad. It’s
Crunchy
Filling
Light
Flavorful
Peanut-y
Sweet
Savory
Seriously healthy
&amp; Super delicious
Bonus? It packs incredibly well for lunch! Make it in the morning or the night before and then throw it in a Tupperwear to eat later. I ate half of mine the first day and other half the next and it was just as delicious!Enjoy!

","Drain tofu by wrapping in a towel and pressing gently. Let rest for 5 minutes. Then unwrap, cube and toss in sesame seeds. If you don’t like raw tofu, check out this “Make Tofu Taste Good” recipe! Just omit the sesame seeds so they don’t burn in the oven.Prepare peanut sauce by whisking all ingredients together except the water. Then add in 1 Tbsp very hot water a little at a time until pourable. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Add kale to a large mixing bowl and drizzle with lime juice, toasted sesame oil and agave. Massage with hands for 1 minute to incorporate ingredients and soften the leaves.Add kale to serving plate or bowl and top with sliced radishes, carrot and sesame-tofu.

683,Vegan Chocolate Silk Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"6-Ingredient Vegan Chocolate Silk Pie

When in Bali last year we stumbled upon this super hippy dippy vegan cafe just 10 minutes from our villa.
During our stay we ordered delivery many times and even went in for breakfast one morning, primarily to gawk at all of their organic baked goods. One item I knew I had to try the moment I saw it was their vegan mud pie.
Not all mud pies are made equal – this I now know.
For dinner one night I ordered a salad and one behemoth slice of their famed mud pie. Two bites in? Eh, kind of disappointed. How can a mud pie disappoint, you ask? I don’t know! But something was amiss. This had to be fixed (clearly).

This pie begins with a simple, 3-ingredient crust that’s essentially a raw brownie. Raw walnuts, dates, and cocoa powder (or cacao powder for a true raw brownie experience).
Pressed into the bottom of a pie pan it makes the perfect crust for your 3-ingredient, fudgy chocolate filling.


This filling is so easy and so undetectably dairy-free it’s ridiculous.
Silken tofu is the magic here. Before you get all, “Tofu is gross, what is it anyway, isn’t it bad for you?” hear me out, Rhonda.
I too was once skeptical of tofu, but since learning about the health benefits of soy from some reputable health sources(namely Dr. Andrew Weil), I know organic, non-GMO tofu can be extremely healthy for your diet. It’s high in protein, low in fat and has even been found to lower cholesterol by up to 40 percent.
I’m not a health expert nor am I recommending you start eating tofu hand over fist (it’s not for everyone). I’m just saying, it’s nothing to be afraid of! Especially when added to silky, chocolatey pies such as this.


The texture of this pie is absolutely sensational. Creamy, rich, mega chocolate-y. I had one small slice and was done for! Usually I eat large servings of dessert and hardly feel satisfied. But with this, a little goes a long way.
You can serve it two ways: Chilled or frozen.
I tried both and preferred mine frozen because it’s much easier to serve as it’s firmer in texture. But chilled is good too, just know it takes a little finagling to get those first couple pieces out of the pan. You can also freeze it to set, slice and then let it set out for 10-15 minutes so it’s more like pudding.

I think you’re going to love this pie! It’s
Rich
Creamy
Velvety
Mega chocolaty
Super satisfying

Reminiscent of mud pie
&amp; A chocolate lover’s dream
Plus, it has a brownie crust! What’s not to love?

Make this pie! And if you do, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see. Cheers!


","Prepare the crust by pulsing walnuts and cocoa powder in a food processor until it reaches a fine meal. Remove and set aside.Place soaked dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and it’s sticky. Add back in the walnut-cocoa meal and process until well combined.Transfer to a glass pie pan lightly oiled with coconut oil. Alternatively, place parchment in the bottom for easy removal. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the crumbs and press with your hands to form a uniform crust that goes up the sides (see photo). Pop in the freezer to set.Melt the chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Once melted, work quickly to add to a blender along with the tofu and coconut (or other dairy free) milk. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides as needed.Pour over crust and smooth. Cover and freeze until set. Alternatively, refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until pretty firm. For easiest serving and longer storage, freeze.Serve and top with coconut whipped cream. Will keep in the fridge for several days, though best when fresh. Freeze for up to a few weeks, covered well."
684,Easy Coconut Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Coconut Curry

I can’t say I’ve ever been to India (though Wes Anderson has me dying to go).
Nor can I even say I’ve eaten at that many authentic Indian restaurants.
But I have tried a curry or two in my day and I know what I like in one.
This recipe is a mix of everything I love about curry all rolled into one pan.

And what do I love most about curries? Veggies and coconut milk.
Since I wanted to keep this vegetarian/vegan friendly, I served it over coconut quinoa for added protein and fiber. I have to say it was a lovely choice. It really marries the dish together well (but completely optional).

The rest of the recipe is basically veggies of your choice and a special mix of spices.
I went with broccoli, carrot, onion, snow peas and tomato, but you could go with just bell peppers and onion, potatoes, cauliflower, etc. – whatever you wish!
As for the spices I kept it simple with curry powder and a pinch of cayenne. But you could also just add a dried red chili for a similar effect. Extra turmeric, cinnamon or cumin would also be lovely.

The end result? A super simple, veggie-packed (vegan and GF-friendly) curry that will please a crowd. Even those on the fence about curries should try this recipe as it’s heavy on the coconut milk and light on the spices. I think you’re going to love it.
It’s:
Warm
Comforting
Satisfying
Rich but healthy
Not too spicy
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Loaded with veggies
Enjoy!

","If serving with coconut quinoa, begin by washing thoroughly in a fine mesh strainer. Add to a medium saucepan over medium heat and toast for 3 minutes. Add light coconut milk and 1/2 cup water (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is light, fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Set aside until serving.In the meantime, heat a large saucepan or pot to medium heat and add coconut oil. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, carrot, broccoli and a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened – about 5 minutes.Add curry powder, cayenne (or chili pepper), veggie stock, coconut milk, another healthy pinch of salt and stir. Bring to a simmer then reduce heat slightly and continue cooking for 10-15 minutes.Add the snow peas and tomatoes in the last 5 minutes so they don’t overcook.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added another pinch or two of salt.Serve over coconut quinoa (see other options below in notes) and garnish with fresh lemon juice and herbs."

I am not the type of girl that just orders a salad every time we go out.
I used to be that girl, but that was when I used to be over concerned about my thighs touching. No more. If I’m hungry, give me a burger. Half burger, half ketchup, that is, with tons o’ fries. Then I’m a happy patron.

But I’m not always big on meat. I mean, have you ever eaten a burger and then felt like you needed a 5 hour nap just to recover? Yeah, that’s me. In my quest to find the perfect veggie burger I’ve tried quite a few but never quite felt like I’d found “the one.” That had to change.

With this recipe I not only aimed to simplify veggie burgers, but also keep them flavorful and with sturdy texture. In my mind, a good veggie burger should be slightly crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and not at all “gummy.”
Friends, I’m happy to report that these little gems not only require just 7 ingredients, but they also hit the nail on the head with both flavor and texture. Serious score.

The base starts with onion and mushroom, sautéed to deepen their color, flavor and texture. Then I added in a light seasoning of salt, pepper and chili powder (or cumin). Then came the mashed beans – I went with kidney to try something different than black beans, which is the legume most veggie burgers rely on.
Last but not least, ground walnuts and cooked quinoa for a “dry” that not only creates a lovely crumbly texture, but also adds heaps of nutritional benefits.

I tested these two ways:
1) Thicker patties baked in the oven
2) Thinner patties sautéed in a skillet
I’m happy to report that both worked! The baking takes longer but yields a better overall texture, I believe. But if you’re in a time crunch, throw them on the stovetop! They’ll do just fine.

Now, the important part. What do they taste like? I’m glad you asked. They’re
Tender
Slightly crisp
Perfectly browned
Savory
Smoky
Hearty
Satisfying
&amp; Ridiculously addictive
I had one for sampling purposes, then another…The rest are just waiting to be devoured. These won’t last long around my house or yours.

This recipe yields about 10 thicker baked sliders or 16 thinner “grilled” sliders. So one batch will feed a descent-sized crowd! But if it’s just you and a friend, I’d suggest par-baking them for maybe 15 minutes and then pulling them out to freeze. Then, when you’re ready to eat one, just pop it out of the freezer and bake until warmed through and adequately browned and no longer tender.
All that’s left to do is top as desired. I went with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, onion, tomato. But I’m someone of a hamburger purist, so do as you wish! I’m sure these would be awesome with avocado and salsa for more of a Mexican spin, or with cheese (vegan or not) and some vegan bacon. Dream big and eat several – they are sliders after all.Enjoy!

","Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add some nonstick spray or add a bit of olive oil. When hot, add the onion and slowly sauté, seasoning with a pinch each salt and pepper.When the onions are soft – about 5 minutes – turn up the heat to medium and add the mushrooms. Season with another pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the mushrooms and onions are slightly browned and fragrant – about 3 minutes.Remove from heat and add beans and mash. You’re looking for a rough mash, not to turn it into a paste, so you can leave some whole or halved if you want. Taste and add another pinch of salt, or pepper if needed.Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl, add the quinoa, chili powder or cumin and stir. Lastly, add the walnuts a little at a time until the mixture is thick and malleable enough to form into patties. Pop in the fridge for 10-15 minutes to cool and preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray or olive oil.Once chilled, form into small patties. I love using a peanut butter jar lid lined with plastic wrap to get the perfect, mess-free shape (a tip I learned from Iowa Girl Eats). See photo.Arrange on the baking sheet and brush or spray the tops with olive oil and another pinch of black pepper and any leftover crushed walnuts (optional). Bake for a total of 40-45 minutes, flipping around the 20-minute mark. Cook longer to dry them out even more and achieve more crisp, but it’s not necessary. For a quicker option, form into thinner patties (1/4 inch) and brown in a saucepan over medium to medium-high heat lightly coated with olive oil. Cook until brown on both sides – 3-4 minutes on each side. However, this version doesn’t get them as well done in the middle.Serve on small buns or atop mixed greens with desired toppings.If you don’t want to cook the whole batch at once, form into 10 thicker patties (as original recipe is written), par-bake them at 375 for 15-20 minutes. Then cool and stack between layers of parchment paper and cover. Freeze for up to a few weeks. To cook, bake as instructed until desired texture/color is reached.Makes ~10 medium baked patties or ~16 thin sautéed patties (as original recipe is written)"
686,Vegan Banana French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Banana French Toast

If you love banana bread and you love french toast, you will LOVE this 5-Ingredient Vegan Banana French Toast!


That’s right, 5 ingredients. Six if you desire a splash of vanilla. But it’s not necessary!
You really want the banana flavor/sweetness to shine through anyway. Plus, it takes the place of a sweetener and an egg in this recipe. Bananas seriously have it going on.

The batter is simple to throw together. Just mash your banana, add the other ingredients and wait while you preheat your griddle. Then dip, soak and cook! Look how golden crispy the edges get. SO seriously yum.


All that’s left to do is top this stack with maple syrup, more banana (and gobs of peanut butter, who am I kidding?). You’re going to love this simple french toast. It’s
Moist
Slightly crisp
Tender
Loaded with banana bread flavor
Sweet
Cinnamon-y
Wholesome
Satisfying and
&amp; Super delicious
The best part? You really can’t tell the egg is missing. I was pleasantly surprised!

Invite over a friend or two and make a french toast party out of it! Who would ever turn down french toast, anyway? That’s what I wanna know. (If they do, you need new friends. I’m sorry, somebody had to say it, Rhonda.)
Cheers!


","Mash banana in a large shallow bowl.Add almond milk, flaxseed, cinnamon and stir. If your batter appears extremely gloppy, add more almond milk to thin it out. It should be pourable. (Vanilla is optional.)Let batter rest for 5 minutes while you preheat your griddle or skillet to medium heat.Once your surface is hot, coat generously with vegan butter or coconut oil (I used Earth Balance because I like the flavor).Dip your slices of bread into the batter and let it rest for 5-10 seconds on each side, using your fingers to make sure it's fully submerged. Transfer immediately to griddle. An optional step is to sprinkle the freshly-dipped sides with a little almond meal for added texture.Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until evenly golden brown. Flip carefully using a sturdy spatula as the banana mixture can be a bit sticky if you're not gentle. If your french toast appears to be browning too quickly or burning, turn down your griddle.Serve immediately with desired toppings. I think peanut butter and maple syrup are all you need here."
687,Vegan Parmesan Cheese Sticks | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pesto Parmesan Breadsticks

Sometimes, a girl needs just a breadstick (sans cheese). This is the breadstick for you!

While I’m not just a huge bread person, there is something ridiculously satisfying about a breadstick to round out a delicious pasta meal, or dipped straight intorich tomato sauce. I think we can all agree we could use a good breadstick recipe in our back pocket for times such as this.

To amp up the flavor of these babies vegan style, I whipped up a batch of vegan pesto! It’s super easy. You just sub vegan parmesan for the parmesan cheese (or omit it) and throw in tons of basil, nuts, and olive oil! Blend, blend, blend and you’re as good as gold. Green gold, that is. (Alternatively, just seek out a store bought vegan-friendly pesto for even quicker prep.)

This dough is based off of my favorite, go-to pizza dough. It’s fast, it’s easy, and it doubles in size like a boss. All that’s left to do is roll it out and spread with all of that green gold you must made. So, dang, tasty.

A healthy sprinkle of vegan parm and into the oven they go. Then out they come, fluffy, pillowy sticks of pesto, cheesy, breadstick goodness. Swoon.

I was so pleased with how these turned out. They’re:
Fluffy
Light
Pesto infused
Perfectly ‘cheesy’
Slightly crisp on the edges
Pillowy
Comforting
Satisfying
Shareable
&amp; Perfect with pasta or marinara
Friends, you’re going to love this recipe! It’s so easy and makes a ton. Freeze your leftovers for meals later in the week. If pesto isn’t your thing, just brush with olive oil and top with the parmesan cheese. You can’t go wrong with basic. Cheers!

","To make the pesto, add all ingredients to a food processor and mix until combined, leaving a little texture. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Store covered in the fridge for up to a couple weeks, though best when fresh. Freeze for longer term storage.For the breadsticks, add 1 cup warm water – 110 degrees (43 C) or about the temp of bath water – to a large mixing bowl (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Make sure it’s not too hot or it will kill the yeast. Sprinkle on yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.Add the sugar, oil, salt and stir. Using a wooden spoon, slowly add the flour and mix until a dough ball forms. You may not be able to add all 3 cups of flour, so add a little at a time until it won’t accept anymore (amount as original recipe is written // refer to the higher end of the range if altering batch size). You will likely add in more while kneading.Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until a smooth ball comes together.Wipe out your mixing bowl and add 1 Tbsp olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add dough back in, flipping a couple times to cover with oil, leaving the seam side down. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for about an hour. The dough should double in size (see photo).Cut the dough in half. Reserve one half for later use. Will freeze for up to 3 months, or stay in the fridge for a few days.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).On a floured surface, roll the remaining half of the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Carefully transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet, reforming it into a rectangle.Leaving the edges bare, generously brush with vegan pesto and top with an even layer of vegan parmesan cheese. You could also add a handful of vegan mozzarella if you wish, such as Daiya shreds. In place of the pesto, you could also sub red sauce.Bake for 11 – 13 minutes or until the crust and cheese are golden brown. Slice and serve immediately."
688,Vegan Garlic Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegan Garlic Pasta with Roasted Tomatoes

I’ve had a fairly easy time giving up a lot of my favorite dairy-containing foods over the last year (yogurt, ice cream, cheese), but pasta and pizza have been tough ones for me. Pizza, I’ve recently discovered, works great cheese-less with a healthy shake of vegan parmesan. But pasta has mainly stumped me…until now.
One of the meals I’ve made for John and myself every week for the last several years is a lightened upPesto Alfredowith some form of steamed veggie. I love the richness and creamy texture it offers. While I recognize there is a place for cashew-based sauces, I wanted something so undetectably creamy that it had to be nut free.
So I started with simple ingredients that I use in my original recipe, but swapped the regular milk for almond milk. As for the cheese? I supplemented other flavor in the form of shallot, garlic and roasted tomatoes. And when serving, I shake on a healthy amountvegan parm. The result?Pasta that sends me straight to creamy pasta heaven.

This is a 30-minute meal that’s virtually fool-proof. While you get your sauce going by sauteeing garlic and shallot in a little olive oil, roast your grape tomatoes. When you roast tomatoes in a little olive oil and sea salt, it enhances their natural flavor and gives them an almost smoky, fire-roasted taste, which pairs perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce.

Once your sauce is thickened you can either blend it for undetectable creaminess or leave it with a bit of texture. Then, all that’s left to do is toss in the tomatoes and garnish with fresh herbs, black pepper, or a little parm. This dish is so simple yet so flavorful! It’s:
Creamy
Rich
Savory
Garlicky
Warm
Comforting
&amp; Surprisingly satisfying
I served ours with a little steamed broccoli and, of course, some white wine. What’s white pasta without white wine? This really is the perfect quick meal for weeknights that will please even picky eaters. Don’t even mention there’s no butter or cream and I’ll bet no one will notice. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and toss tomatoes in a bit of olive oil and sea salt. Place cut side up on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes while you prepare the rest of the dish. Then set aside.Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta according to package instructions. When done, drain, cover and set aside.In the meantime, prepare the sauce. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml // use more, as needed, if increasing batch size) olive oil and the garlic and shallot. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper and stir frequently, cooking for 3-4 minutes until softened and fragrant.Stir in flour (or other thickener of choice – see notes) and mix with a whisk. Once combined, slowly whisk in the almond milk a little at a time so clumps don’t form. Add another healthy pinch of salt and black pepper, bring to a simmer and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes to thicken. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. (Optional: You can also add a few shakes of vegan parmesan for extra flavor at this time if you wish.)If you want an ultra creamy sauce, transfer sauce to a blender (or use an immersion blender) to blend the sauce until creamy and smooth. Place back in pan and reduce heat to a low simmer until desired thickness is reached.Once the sauce is to your desired thickness, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Then add pasta and roasted tomatoes and stir.Serve immediately and garnish with extra black pepper, fresh basil, and/or vegan parmesan cheese. Best when fresh, but will keep for up to 2 days in fridge."
689,Vegan French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Basic Vegan French Toast

We just celebrated our fourth wedding anniversary and it caused me to reflect on our early days of marriage, living in Portland in late spring, early summer. I made us breakfast most mornings – just like I do now – and we’d sit and talk with the windows open before getting to the day’s tasks. I discovered early on John isn’t a pancake guy. The thing is, I’m a pancake girl. But our common ground? French toast. Thank goodness.


Since going dairy-free, I haven’t made french toast as often as I used to, but I do miss it. Our favorite recipe is basic with a little cinnamon and vanilla, then topped with fresh strawberries and maple syrup or honey.
I’m not entirely egg-free (though am growing more suspicious of them by the moment), but I wanted to make a vegan french toast recipe A) to see if it was in fact possible to make french toast without eggs, and B) to come up with my own variation to share with you all, as I know there are already a lot of vegan frenchy recipes out there.
At first I considered “thickening” the batter with a starch (i.e. flour) of some kind, but then I really just wanted to keep it healthy and natural. And so, I went with chia seeds. I ground mine up to make them less visible in the final product (for those eaters of yours who inspect every bite and ask, “What’s in this?” before digging in). But this certainly isn’t a necessary step.

The batter is basic. Non-dairy milk, chia seeds, vanilla, agave, cinnamon. For the bread I went with a rustic wheat,and found that heartier breads to better here.
The trick to the batter is letting it sit to firm up a bit. Chia seeds typically take 10-15 minutes to activate (longer for pudding), and that’s about how long I let mine rest before dipping the bread in. Go longer for thicker batter, but no too long or it can turn into a pudding (which is not what you want). You’re basically looking for a batter that resembles traditional french toast batter with the egg. Ya dig?

The result? A dreamy, simple, perfectly-sweet french toast that’s completely vegan. So what does it taste like?
It’s light
Slightly sweet
Warm from the cinnamon
Tender with a subtle bite
Filling
Wholesome
&amp; Perfect for adding whatever toppings you prefer

Me? I went with coconut whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and a little maple syrup. This would also be lovely with a compote, sliced bananas, peanut or almond butter, or agave. Consider this recipe a basic french toast base, perfect for adding whatever flavors you want to make it your own.
I hope you enjoy it! And if you do, be sure to take a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. It’s kind of my favorite. Cheers!


","Mix all ingredients except the bread in a large, shallow bowl. Place in the fridge to activate for 10-20 minutes.Preheat griddle to medium heat (~350 degrees F / 176 C) and grease with 1 Tbsp vegan butter or coconut oil.Dip each slice of bread in the batter for about 20 seconds on each side. If your bread is dry, leave it in a little longer. If you're using sandwich bread, it should only need 25-30 seconds total to soak.Place on griddle and cook until golden brown on the underside. Carefully flip and cook until the other side is golden brown as well - 3-4 minutes.Top with desired toppings: I went with coconut whipped cream, strawberries, and maple syrup."
690,Vegan Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Meyer Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins

Sometimes a recipe asks you to make it. Such was the case with these 30-minute, lemony-glazed beauties.

I was strolling innocently through Trader Joe’s when I noticed a new type of lemon right beside my old standbys: Meyer lemons!
When things come into season (where I live) it excites me and I must experiment. One look at this juicy bunch of lemons and I couldn’t shake my head from one thing: Meyer lemon poppy seed muffins.
And so it began…

This batter is made in ONE bowl to save you time and energy. It’s also whole grain, vegan and incredibly easy! Not to mention, it’s extremely versatile in that you could sub or omit the poppy seeds for fruit, nuts, or seeds.


Oh man, one bite into these gems and I was in love. The 2-ingredient lemon glaze didn’t hurt…


These lemon muffins are beckoning to be made! They’re
Tender
Perfectly tart
Not too sweet
Wholesome
Flecked with poppy seeds
Frosted with citrusy glaze
Satisfying

It’s time to party vegan-style. You in?

You guys probably know by now that I’ve been having all sorts of fun with cashews and nutritional yeastlately. They’re a vegan baker’s dream ingredients, yielding both sweet and savory treats with ease!
The two together? Unstoppable. This recipe is proof of that fact.

If you’ve ever had a jalapeño popper, you know they make you feel like sinking down into your chair and onto the floor after three. Typically, poppers are stuffed with loads of cream cheese and deep fried. I’m not OK with those two things. In fact, I am protesting those two things right now.
Despite replacing them with vegan cheese and baking instead of frying, the flavor and texture is not compromised one bit! The flavor is spot-on, and the gluten-free tortilla crumb topping brings these babies to the next level.
Like I said, it’s party time.

This recipe is simple in that it requires 10 ingredients total! And a bonus? It comes together in 30 minutes. Easy party favors for the win.

What do they taste like? Kind of amazing. They’re:
Tenderwith an adequate bite
Slightly spicy
Perfectly cheesy

Satisfying
&amp; Perfect for sharing

Next time I go to a get-together, watch a sports game (probably never), or see my mom (who lives for Sonic Jalapeño Poppers), I’m bringing these babies.
If you do make them, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see.No like seriously, it makes my day. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and prep your jalapeños, splitting in half, removing the tops, and then spritzing or brushing them with a bit of olive oil. Place in rows facing up (see photo).If you’re using crushed tortilla chips as a topper (recommended), toast them while prepping your cheese sauce by spritzing them with olive oil and baking them for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown, watching closely as they can burn fast.To a small saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic with a bit of olive oil and cook until just softened and fragrant – about 5 minutes. Set aside.Add soaked cashews, garlic, onion, nutritional yeast, cumin, vegetable broth and green chilies to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth, using the “liquify” or “puree” option if you have it. If the sauce is too thick, thin with more vegetable broth. If too thin, add a handful of raw cashews and blend again.Spoon or pipe the cheese mixture into the jalapeños, generously filling. You’ll have leftovers, which you can reserve for nachos or just dip. Top with crushed, toasted tortilla chip crumbs and bake for 15 minutes or until the jalapeños are soft and the cheese has deepened in color.Place the pan on the top rack and broil for the last minute or two for an even more intense color/flavor.Serve immediately, sprinkling with a bit of red pepper flake for garnish (optional). Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a few days, reheating in the microwave or a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through (though best when fresh)."
692,Healthy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes 2.0

Sometimes, a recipe is worth revisiting. This, my friends, is one of them.

This may look like an insignificant – albeit delicious – stack of pancakes to you. But to me it looks like beginnings.
Chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes was the first recipe I ever posted on Minimalist Baker. I knew it was a good recipe, I personally loved it, but I had no idea it would be so well loved by all of you.


Since initially sharing the recipe nearly two years ago, I’ve been wanting to recreate it to make some improvements.
I wanted it to be not only vegan, but also gluten-free. And I wanted it to require just 1 bowl. Less mess, more people who can enjoy it. Worthwhile improvements if you ask me.

So, I went to work and kind of perfected the thing. I don’t know how many times I’ve made this recipe in my life, but it just keeps getting better. And now I can confidently say it’s perfected.
Vegan, gluten free, 1 bowl chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes. Friends, say hello to the only pancake recipe you’ll ever need.


To keep these gluten free I replaced the whole wheat flour with a mix of my favorite basic gluten free flour blend (which I always keep on hand for GF recipes) and almond meal.
I love how this swap helped the pancakes not only cook through a bit better, but also achieve better overall texture.


You’re gonna love these new-and-improved cakes. They are:
Super moist
Hearty
Filling
Not too sweet
Studded with melty chocolate chips
Super satisfying
&amp; JUST like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie (without actually being a cookie)

I used to get up early on Saturday mornings, run a few miles, and then come home to a fat stack of banana pancakes that were quite similar to these bad boys. Now that I’ve re-discovered this fool-proof, now-perfected version, it has me wanting to re-establish that tradition all over again.
Here’s to spring, to new traditions, and to oatmeal cookie pancakes. Cheers!


","Prepare flax egg in a large bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and letting set for 3-5 minutes.Add your very ripe banana and baking powder and mash.Add oil, salt, vanilla, almond butter, almond milk and stir.Stir in oats, almond meal and gluten free flour blend until just combined.Then sprinkle in chocolate chips and fold gently. Let rest for 5 minutes while preheating griddle to medium-low heat. You want it hot but not too hot or it will burn the pancakes - about 300-325 degrees.Scoop 1/4 cup measurements onto the lightly-greased griddle and gently spread to make a pancake shape. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown. You'll know they're ready to flip when bubbles form on top and the edges appear dry.Note: These need to cook slower than regular pancakes because they’re more dense and take a bit longer to get cooked in the middle. So if they are browning too quickly, turn the heat down.Serve as is or with a small drizzle of maple syrup and a few additional chocolate chips. Leftovers re-heat well in the microwave."
693,Simple Vegan Chocolate Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Chocolate Cake

Four years ago this month,John and I were just kids planning our wedding. We decided to give up sweets during our engagement to feel our best on our wedding day, and to more fully enjoy our dessert bar and wedding cake.
The big day finally arrived. We had been so good, not even having an ounce of sweets aside from honey and the occasional after-dinner mint. And you better believe we pigged out at the reception. I was in sweet tooth heaven.

Like most, our honeymoon was a time of sheer indulgence so when we got settled back into “real life” we hit the reset button on our diet. Sweets were out the door again.
That was, until we attended the wedding of some close friends in Portland where I met the chocolate cake that perhaps changed my life.

Yes, big words for a cake.
I’d resigned to give desserts up indefinitely.But then we show up at this wedding and it’s absolutely charming and the food is delicious and the ambience is perfect and the music is a local bluegrass band…and all at once they bring out this giant chocolate cake.
I wrangled our entire table into a discussion over whether or not this cake was worth breaking my fast for.
Unanimously, we agreed yes. I took one bite into this luxurious, velvety, rich chocolate cake, and amidst so many layers of mousse, cake and ganache my mind couldn’t comprehend what my taste buds were experiencing.
Was it worth it? Without a doubt, yes.

These days my sweet tooth still wins once in a while, but I keep it to the occasional indulgence. A donut here, a cookie there, almost always something on the healthier side of the spectrum. But especially in the last 6 months, always dairy free.And so, it was a given that I had to make my dream chocolate cake vegan style.
Friends, I’ve done just that.
As the title suggests, this cake is made in 1 bowl in under 1 hour! You can even make your buttercream frosting in the same bowl you used for the cake. Simplicity at its finest.

The ingredients are fairly simple and considerably “healthier” than most chocolate cakes.
Coconut oil replaces vegetable or canola
Oil is reduced with the addition of applesauce
Cane sugar replaces granulated sugar
And the only (vegan) “butter” is in the (vegan) “buttercream” frosting

So, what does it taste like? Just like chocolate cake should! It’s:
Tender
Fluffy
Chocolaty
Sweet
Moist
Decadent
Generously frosted
&amp; Perfect with a glass of almond milk

If you’re like me, chocolate cake (or any cake, for that matter) deserves a giant scoop of ice cream beside it. Melty ice cream and a thick slice of heavily-frosted cake – does it get any better than that?
But for the modest cake eater, a glass of almond milk is really all you need to wash down this vegan chocolate dream. Enjoy!

Speaking of almond milk, this recipe marks the first of several recipes we’ll be sharing over the next few months featuring Blue Diamond Almond Breeze! I’ve been using Almond Breeze for years and am thrilled to bring you guys some tasty recipes featuring a product I adore so much. For more information about the integrity of this brand, see their FAQ page.
Now bring on the cake!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly spray 2 8-inch round cake pans or 1 large rectangular pan with nonstick spray (see notes for cooking times for different size pans // adjust number or size of pans if altering batch size). Dust with cocoa powder, shake out the excess and set aside.Mix the almond milk and vinegar in a large mixing bowl, and let set for a few minutes to activate. Add the oil, coffee, vanilla extract, and applesauce and beat until foamy.Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a sifter and slowly sift over the wet ingredients while mixing with a hand-held or standing mixer. If you don’t have a sifter, simply mix dry ingredients in another bowl and add to the wet mixture while beating. Beat until no large lumps remain. It should be creamy and pourable. Taste and adjust sweetness as needed, adding more sugar if desired (I found it plenty sweet).Divide batter evenly between your cake pans or rectangular pan.Bake 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting.While cooling, prepare frosting by beating together all ingredients until light and fluffy, adding the powdered sugar in small amounts until you reach your desired consistency and sweetness. If it becomes too thick, add more almond milk. If it's too thin, add more cocoa powder or powdered sugar.Once the cake is cooled, frost generously with buttercream frosting, adding a thick layer between the top and bottom layers (if doing a 2-layer cake). Alternatively, omit the frosting and dust with cocoa powder.Serve with a scoop of dairy-free ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate, or caramel sauce, coconut whipped cream or a glass of almond milk!"
694,Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Double Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies

Once I’d crafted the ultimate5-Ingredient Vegan GF Cookie, you knew I had to play around with it. Plus, since then I’ve also discoveredDIY Peanut Butter Chips. Hello? Combining the two was a total given.
This recipe starts in the food processor and finishes in a mixing bowl so you don’t lose the texture of the oats or the baking chips. Altogether it’s about a 30 minute recipe that makes very little mess (a.k.a. my kind of recipe).

These guys get their peanut butter kick from two sources:
1) Peanut butter that’s added into the batter
2) Peanut butter chips that are baked right alongside the chocolate chips
The double PB combo makes my heart swoon, and the chocolate chips make the perfect flavor complement.

The cookies bake up tender and hearty with the perfect combo of salty-sweet. And because they’re naturally sweetened they’re really quite “healthy” enough to enjoy as a post-workout snack or after-meal dessert. In a pinch, I wouldn’t scoff at the idea of having a couple for breakfast. But coming from the girl who loves a goodFriday donut.
A note about the PB baking chips: They are 100% natural, so they don’t keep their form as well as traditional baking chips, which get extra help from a variety of additives. As you can see, you’ll get a few little holes during the baking process, but the flavor is 100% spot on! If that’s the “trade-off” for natural peanut butter chips, count me in!

Hope you try these little guys! Make a big batch and throw them in the freezer. They’re like a little granola bar bite on the go, and the perfect healthier treat when your sweet tooth strikes. Enjoy!

","Add dates to a food processor and pulse until small bits remain.Add banana and peanut butter and mix again until combined, scraping down the sides as needed.Next add the almond meal and rolled oats and pulse until a loose dough is formed. It will be kind of wet and sticky. That’s OK! You’re on the right track.Scrape your dough into a mixing bowl. If it feels too wet to the touch to form into cookies, add another few Tbsp of almond meal and/or oats and stir. I added another few tablespoons of each until I was able to form them into cookies without them sticking too much to my hands.Add in chocolate and peanut butter chips, then chill dough for 10 minutes and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts of your cookie dough and form into loose discs, then arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They won’t expand so pack them closer together (but not touching).Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown and somewhat firm to the touch. The good thing about these cookies is a little under-baked is OK since there are no eggs and they’ll ultimately just be a little more moist.Remove and let set for a few minutes on the pan. Then carefully transfer to a plate or cooling rack to cool. Serve immediately.Store leftovers in an airtight container for several days. Move to the fridge or freezer for longer term storage."
695,Vegan Green Chili Mac n Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Green Chili Mac ‘n’ Cheese

I’m sure we all have horror stories of the mac n cheese of our yesteryear. For me it was almost always boxed, but in the rare chance that it wasn’t, it was certainly made with that processed block of horror known as Velveeta (*shiver).
This is not that kind of mac n cheese. This is unprocessed, wholesome, dairy-free goodness for those of us who still crave a bit of our childhood favorites without all the junk.

Don’t be intimidated by vegan mac n cheese. I was a little skeptical at first because my initial attempts at cashew sauces were unsuccessful. But I’ve learned a few tricks here and there (how long to soak, how long to blend, what spices/seasonings to add) and I’m now a HUGE fan. It’s unbelievable how a jar of soaked cashews can turn into rich sauces, luxurious ice creams and bonafide cheesy goodness.
Plus, this particular recipe requires just 10 ingredients (minus the tortilla chips) and 30 minutes! It doesn’t get any easier than that.

This sauce is infused with plenty of flavor thanks to cumin, chili powder and green chilies. Half of the chilies go into the sauce, while the other half get stirred into the final product. The result is oh-so dreamy.


Once you stir the sauce with the noodles and the green chilies, it’s time for a little crunch. I toasted up some tortilla chips until golden brown then sprinkled them on top for another layer of flavor and texture. I was in love. Swoon.
You’re going to love this mac n cheese. It’s:
Creamy
Luxurious
Savory
Super Cheesy
Velvety
Perfectly spiced from the green chilies
Mega satisfying
&amp; Altogether dreamy
Oh, and by the way, each serving has 19 grams of protein! WHAT?!!

I personally think you could serve this to a non-vegan and they would totally dig it. They may be able to tell it’s not “true mac n cheese,” but it’s so creamy and flavorful and satisfying that they’ll have to be won over. This makes enough for 4, or 3 very generously, so invite a few friends and take them to vegan cheese heaven. Cheers!

","If topping with tortilla chips, crush chips into fine crumbs and add to a baking pan lined with parchment paper or foil. Spritz with olive or avocado oil, sprinkle with salt and stir. Then bake in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 10 minutes or until golden brown.Boil macaroni according to package instructions.In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, sauté onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, stir and cook until soft and fragrant – about 7 minutes. Set aside.Add onions and garlic to a blender with remaining ingredients, omitting the tortilla chips and adding only half of the green chilies. Blend until smooth, using the “liquify” setting if you have it to get it really smooth. Otherwise just blend for up to a minute, scraping down sides as necessary, until smooth and creamy.Drain the noodles, set aside, and cover (with a towel). To the same pot you boiled the noodles in, add the cashew cheese and cook on low stirring frequently until slightly thickened.Add the macaroni noodles to the cheese, along with the remaining green chilies and stir. Serve immediately, topping with crushed toasted tortilla chips and cilantro (optional)."
696,1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread

Three bananas. One Bowl. Zero gluten. Let’s do this.
You may remember my recipe for gluten free banana bread with butternut squash. It’s one of my favorites of all time. Yes, all time. But I couldn’t help but strip it down to the absolute essentials and take it back to classic banana bread land.
Friends, behold: 1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread.

The ingredients for this scrumptious, hearty bread begin with three overripe bananas. Then come essentials you likely alreadyhave on hand, such as eggs (or chia/flax eggs), vanilla and coconut oil. To sweeten things up a bit more I relied on a mix of honey, cane and brown sugar for a variance of flavor and texture.
Then comes the gluten-free goodness: a mix of gluten free oats, almond meal and my favorite gluten-free flour blend (which can be subbed out with just about any gluten-free blend).
This recipe is forgiving in that the type of GF blend you use doesn’t really matter as much since there’s two other dry ingredient components evening things out. And of course, if you’re not gluten free just sub whole wheat pastry or all purpose for the blend.

45 minutes to 1 hour in the oven and this baby is ready for the taking.

I could hardly wait to slice in, but patience is key here. You need to wait a good hour before cutting into this baby, else it will crumble and fall apart. That’s what you don’t want.

This is what you do want. A hearty loaf that holds its shape and converts even the most suspicious of eaters into gluten-free banana bread lovers. Hubba hubba.

This bread is:
Hearty
Perfectly moist
Loaded with banana flavor
Just sweet enough
Spotted with oats and almond meal
Slightly nutty
Incredibly satisfying
&amp; Altogether dreamy
Trust me, you’re gonna love this bread. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.Mash banana in a large bowl. Add all ingredients through almond milk and whisk vigorously to combine. Last add almond meal, gluten free flour blend and oats and stir.Bake for 1 hour – 1 hour 15 minutes. When ready, it should feel firm and be crackly and golden brown on top.Let cool completely before cutting or it will be too tender to hold form.Serve with butter and honey or as is. Store leftovers in a covered container for up to a few days. Slice and freeze for longer term storage."
697,Vegan Zucchini Gratin | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Zucchini Gratin

When you hear the word ‘gratin,’ what do you think?Cheesy, breadcrumb-laden goodness made of 10% vegetables and 90% butter? Yeah, me too. That’s why my taste buds are usually drawn to this comforting dish but my stomach is turned away.
However, I’ve been thinking of a way to vegan-ize gratin while keeping it simple, natural, flavorful, and gluten-free. No easy task, but I think I’ve cracked the code.
The magic starts with vegan parmesan cheese. Have you tried it?
Dairy-free and vegan friends, if you haven’t you are simply missing out on fairy dust GOLD. Trust me, I have loved parmesan for years. I used to put it on my eggs at breakfast, my soup at lunch, and my potatoes and salads at dinner. Don’t get me started on how much I put on my pizza. I adore its salty, slightly dry goodness on anything and everything, and have a discerning tongue for how it should taste.
Considering this, I had low expectations for how this vegan version would perform.

This – 4 ingredient wonder bomb – actually tastes like parmesan and acts like it in cooking, too!
While it won’t melt into pasta sauces and other hot dishes, it will absolutely toast up and get a nice color. And the most important part, the taste is spot on. If you haven’t tried vegan parm, get some in your life. I adapted this version in this recipe fromVeggieful. Go there for a video demo of how to make the stuff.

One last note, nutritional yeast is a wonder food if you haven’t already heard. It’s high in folic acid, contains 9 grams of protein per 2 Tablespoons – that’s more than an egg! – , contains 3 grams of fiber per serving, and boasts an entire day’s worth of Vitamin B-12 (crucial for red blood cell production) in just 1 Tablespoon. I mean, c’mon. And it tastes like cheese? I mean…
So even if you aren’t vegan or dairy free, you should consider incorporating even a little bit of nutritional yeast into your daily diet.

Once you have your parm ready, move onto your veggies. I opted for yellow and zucchini squash as a base and asparagus for accent because it’s just so beautiful (and cheap!) this time of year. Oh asparagus, I could paint you you’re so pretty.

The other veggie in the mix is onion, which I sauteed to make a nice savory “crust” or base for the asparagus and zucchini to nestle on. This replaces the need for breadcrumbs, puff pastry or pie crust which some veggie tarts require, keeping things light, natural and veggie-focused just the way my body likes it.

Once the onions are sauteed, simply toss your veggies in a bit of olive oil and arrange them in a pretty pattern on top. It doesn’t have to be perfect. In fact, it shouldn’t be. Just put them in a pattern that makes you happy.

Then, the fun part. Top that baby with loads of vegan parm. I mean LOADS. Do your thang girl.

Then bake bake bake until golden brown and toasty. You guys are gonna love this dish. It’s:
Light
Flavorful
Packed with veggies
Entirely guilt-free
Perfectly ‘cheesy’
Super satisfying
&amp; Lovely for spring and summer
In my opinion, it’s just what we need to get us past the last of these icky winter days and into warmer weather. Cheers!

","Prepare vegan parmesan cheese by whirling all ingredients together in a food processor or blender until a fine meal or powder is formed. Don’t over-process or it will begin to get clumpy. Set aside. Will keep covered in the fridge for about a month.In a 10-inch cast iron or oven safe skillet, sauté onion in 1/2 Tbsp olive oil (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) over medium-low heat until soft – about 10 minutes – seasoning with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Set aside.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Slice squash into very thin slices, about 1/8th-inch thick (see photo). Use mandolin if you have one, or just a sharp knife.Cup off the top 2-3 inches of the asparagus. That’s the only part you’ll be using. Save the rest for another dish. Carefully split the top portion in half so it nestles into the gratin better (optional).Add asparagus and squash to a mixing bowl and top with remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil, 3/4 tsp salt, pinch of black pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional), and 2 Tbsp of the vegan parmesan cheese (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Toss to coat.Spread the slightly cooled onions around in the bottom of the skillet to create an even base. Top with squash, layering green and yellow as you go (if you did two colors). It doesn’t have to be perfect. Just start on the outside and work your way in, keeping them in line as much as possible. Once the squash is arranged, tuck pieces of the asparagus into the layers in a circular motion (see photo).Top with an even layer of the vegan parmesan cheese (~3/4 cup // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and bake at 400 degrees F (204 C) for 30 minutes. Then broil on high for the last 1-2 minutes to toast up the top (optional, but recommended). Watch closely as it can burn quickly. Let rest for a few minutes before serving.This makes an excellent side dish, brunch item, or light lunch or dinner when accompanied with a protein, such as hummus, chickpea salad, or scrambled or fried eggs if not vegan. Reheats well in the microwave or the oven."
698,Vegan Chai Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chai Ginger Ice Cream Sandwiches

As if I had a choice…

Last week I made Vegan Chai Ice Cream and fell in love. The creamy, spicy-sweet goodness that is this cashew-based dessert has made me a vegan ice cream belieber. I’m never going back.
While I could’ve just eaten the entire batch as is, I had a sneaking suspicion it could somehow be elevated. Fate would have it that John asked me that same day whether or not we had any ice cream sandwiches on the site.
The short answer was: yes. Yes, we do. However, there could always be more, right?


What pairs well with chai?
My mind immediately went to these gluten-free vegan ginger cookies I shared over Christmas. When made into circles instead of cutout shapes, they tend to be a little more tender and easy to work with. Plus, hello! Ginger cookies + chai ice cream? Match made in heaven!


I intentionally under-baked the cookies just a tad so they would be extra soft and tender when biting into, especially when frozen. It worked wonders for the texture! However, if you’re into a crispier bite, bake them another 1-2 minutes. Either way, the flavor will be amazing.


Friends, I am SO stinking excited about how these turned out! They’re:
Creamy
Slightly spicy
Sweet
Tender
Perfectly ginger-y
Beautifully infused with molasses flavor
Spot-on chai tastiness
Super satisfying
&amp; Kind of perfect
I take that back. Absolutely perfect.


And when you bite in?! Oh man! The cookie texture is tender and moist and the ice cream melts perfectly – super velvety and creamy. Plus, the chai-ginger combination is to die for.
You must try these babies! And if you do, tag#minimalistbakeronInstagram! I’d love to see!


","See cookie recipe and follow instructions. Once prepared cookies are cooled, pop them in the freezer to harden.In the meantime, soften chai ice cream until scoopable. Then form into disc shapes by scooping 1/4 cup amounts into the lid of a peanut butter jar or similar-shaped object, lined with plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap to completely cover the ice cream, remove from lid and shape into a loose disc. Pop in the freezer to re-harden. Alternatively, if you don't care about the shape, just smash a big scoop between the cookies.After about 30 minutes, unwrap the ice cream discs and sandwich them between two cookies of similar size/shape. Press down to flatten and then use a spoon, knife or clean finger to smooth the sides and make them more uniform.Pop back in the freezer to set momentarily. Will keep in the freezer in freezer bag or container for up to a couple weeks, though best within the first several days.To eat, let them set out for 5-10 minutes to soften. If you're impatient like me, microwaving them for 8 seconds makes them perfectly soft. Oh my word."
699,Vegan Key Lime Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Key Lime Pies

While doing some research for this recipe, I learned so much about key lime piea la the one and only Martha Stewart. For instance, I discovered where key lime pies originated, what true key limes look and taste like, how sailors used to suck on limes to fend off scurvy, and how to store key limes for year-round use.
Oh, Martha? Is there anything you DON’T know? #teachmeyourways


The thing is, I couldn’t find key limes anywhere in Kansas City! (BOOOO). So I subbed regular limes and you can, too. The only remaining ingredients are:
cashews
agave nectar
coconut milk + oil
graham crackers
vegan butter
That’s it! This is 7-ingredient vegan dessert perfection. And to keep it gluten free, simply sub gluten free cookies OR use a walnut-date crust, such as the one I used for my Simple Vegan Cheesecakes. Next time, I think I’ll go that route to mix things up (plus, it really can’t be beat).


The only real pre-prep you have to do is soak cashews for 4 hours or overnight. The rest takes place in the food processor and blender, starting with the crust.

The crust is simply 1 sleeve of graham crackers and 1/4 cup melted vegan butter (I use Earth Balance).
Simply pulse the two together in a food processor and then press into muffin liners (or make a large pie and use a glass pie dish). Then use a small glass or the back of a spoon to press down and get a uniform top. Lastly, bake for 10 minutes to brown.



Once you blend your filling until creamy and smooth it’s onto the crust and then into freezer. These don’t take but a couple hours to set up so the wrappers peel away easily for serving.



Oh man, these turned out so good and have me aching for spring. They’re:
Creamy
Tart
Sweet
Cold
Satisfying
Slightly crisp from the graham cracker crust
&amp; A perfect light dessert

You can either eat these straight from the freezer, or let them set out for 10-15 minutes to soften, which I preferred. Then they taste like true key lime pie! You’d never guess they were dairy- and egg-free. Enjoy!




","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add graham crackers to a food processor and process until you achieve a fine meal. Then add melted butter and pulse to combine.Distribute evenly among muffin tins and press down with a glass or spoon to flatten. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and set aside to cool.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and blend on high (or liquefy) until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime zest/juice for more tart, or more agave for added sweetness.Pour filling into muffin tins and tap on counter to release air bubbles. Top with a bit more lime zest and loosely cover.Freeze for 2-4 hours or until firm. Remove from the freezer for 10-15 minutes to thaw before serving. Will keep covered in the freezer for up to 2 weeks, though best when fresh."
700,Vegan Chai Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chai Ice Cream

I got addicted to chai in college when I discovered that a local coffee shop near my university served my favorite brand of spiced chai for $1.50. And it was a large chai latte, too! Somehow now chai tea lattes cost around $4 on average, so I rarely get them. It’s just principle. I’m all for treating yourself, but when you can make the same thing at home for half the price, I can rarely bring myself to do it!
Nonetheless, my love affair with chai began and it really never stopped. Chai-infused things are just lovely. And moving into spring I’m already getting into ice cream mode. Not dairy ice cream, vegan ice cream! My body can’t handle the cream and whole milk versions anymore (waaaaaaaa). But thankfully cashews and coconut milk save the day!

This recipe is simple as it requires about 10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and doesn’t require any boiling and chilling, which saves you time. The preparation happens before you ever start by simply chilling your ice cream maker and soaking your cashews to get them blend-able and creamy.

From there the chai flavor is added with a concentrated brewed chai tea and dry chai tea spices.

The traditional spices in chai are cinnamon, ginger, clove, cardamom and black pepper. If you don’t have all of these on hand, just use what you have and let the chai tea compensate the rest of the flavor. And if you don’t have chai tea packets or loose leaf on hand, just use a black tea and add a touch more of each spice. Hopefully one way or the other you’ll be able to pull off that deep spicy chai flavor.


Exciting news! I attempted my first recipe video and am excited to share it with you guys! Let me know what you think.
Q: Do you like recipe videos? Do you find them helpful? Would you like to see more of them on Minimalist Baker? I had a blast putting it together and look forward to developing that skill to make our recipes come to life.

Once you add all your ingredients to your blender, just blend until creamy and smooth. Then transfer directly into an ice cream maker and churn until thick and creamy – about 45 minutes. Scoop into a freezer safe container and freeze until firm. Then scoop, scoop away!

Oh, I was SO pleased with how this turned out! It’s
Thick
Creamy
Sweet
Luxuriously
&amp; Perfectly chai-spiced

The best part? It tastes so creamy and rich that you’d never guess there wasn’t an ounce of cream or whole milk inside. Vegan recipes for the win! Enjoy.





","Set your churning bowl in the freezer the night before to chill. Soak your cashews the night before as well, or for at least 4-6 hour before blending.When ready to prepare ice cream, steep your chai tea in 3/4 cup boiling water (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) for at least 10 minutes. It should be very strong. Remove tea bags, squeezing out excess tea, and let cool in the fridge.In the meantime, drain cashews and measure out other ingredients.Add tea and all remaining ingredients to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth - about 3-4 minutes, using liquify if you have the option. Taste and adjust sweetness/flavors as needed.Add mixture to your chilled ice cream maker bowl and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions until thoroughly chilled, about 45 minutes. It should resemble thick soft serve.Transfer to a freezer-safe container, cover and freeze until hard - at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Will keep in the freezer for up to a week."
701,Raspberry Chipotle Black Bean Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raspberry Chipotle Black Bean Dip

A few years ago some friends of ours took John and me on a tour of Manhattan. Not Manhattan the Big Apple. The little apple. Yes, Kansas has a Little Apple and it’s in the middle of nowhere and it happens to be quite charming. Besides having the some of the most crazed, insane fans in all of college sports, it has the most charming little boutiques, cafe and coffee shops – perfect for a day’s worth of exploring.
If you’re ever there you must do three things…

1. Go to Varsity Donuts for some of the best donuts you’ll EVER have.
2. Go to Radina’s for a true college-town coffee shop experience.
3. Go to So Long Saloon and order the raspberry chipotle bean dip. It is to die for.
In fact, it was one of the primary reasons we went to Manhattan in the first place! Our friends bragged on it so much and insisted we go to this packed bar in the middle of downtown and try this dip.
One bite in, I understood the obsession. This dip may sound a little wacky – black beans, cream cheese and raspberry chipotle sauce? But odd as it may sound, it is out of this world delicious.

The awesome thing about this recipe? It comes together in about 30 minutes and it’s gluten-free and vegan optional. I made it vegan for my dairy-free friends (myself included), but you certainly don’t have to.
Plus, it serves a crowd. If you’re having company or watching the big game or hosting a dinner party, this is the perfect thing to serve. It’s filling and scoop-able and delicious piping hot or room temperature – the perfect kind of dip for grazing over the course of an event.

The preparation is also quite simple.
Saute red onion and garlic, add it to cream cheese and stir.
Heat your black beans with a touch of spices and salt.
Put your cream cheese in the center of a serving dish or skillet,
top with raspberry chipotle sauce (like Bronco Bob’s found at World Market),
then top with grated pepperjack cheese.
Broil till bubbly then eat!
The whole process takes about 30 minutes and leftovers keep and reheat well.

So what does it taste like?
Savory
Sweet
Creamy
Hot
Not too spicy
Hearty
Filling
Addictive
&amp; Perfect on chips
Trust me, you’re gonna love this dip.

You can either serve it as is after cooking or swirl it around to meld the flavors. I only did so slightly for visual appeal, but you can also just use a chip to scoop and swirl as you please.
This is my homage to the original, but it’s not as good as the one you’ll find at So Long Saloon! So if you ever find yourself in Manhattan, Kansas, you know what to do. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).In a small saucepan, heat the beans along with salt, pepper and cumin. Once warmed through, taste and adjust seasonings. Set aside.Add 2 Tbsp olive oil to a 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet (or oven-safe skillet) over medium heat. Add onions and a healthy pinch of salt and stir. Cook until soft and fragrant stirring frequently – about 5 minutes.Add garlic and cook 2 more minutes. Then add to a mixing bowl with the cream cheese and stir.Removed from the stove top, add the cream cheese-onion mixture back to the cast iron skillet. Place it in the center and make a well (or just spread it in an even layer on the bottom for more even distribution).Add the black beans on top around the outside of the cream cheese, and pour the raspberry chipotle sauce in the center.Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top (optional but recommended) and bake for 12-15 minutes or until warmed through and bubbly and the cheese is melted.Remove from oven and top with a bit of additional cheese and fresh cilantro (optional). Serve immediately.You can either swirl everything around first to combine flavors, or let people scoop into it with chips and get a little bite of each ingredient. Leftovers will keep covered in the fridge for several days. Just reheat in the microwave or the oven."
702,Ginger Tea Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Ginger Latte

We love Colorado. Always have.
John and my families both vacationed there when we were growing up, and we honeymooned in Breckenridge for two weeks after our wedding in 2010. The whole state has a special place in our hearts.
Two years ago we made a trip to visit friends and get our mountain fix, and we ended up at a little coffee and tea shop in Fort Collins that I was initially underwhelmed by but immediately bowled over with affection after trying one sip of their creamy ginger latte.
Friends, it was love.

Ever since then, I’ve had a love affair with ginger. Not only is it insanely good for you, it adds the most amazing flavor to dishes like including soups, cookies and even cocktails. I’ve tried with half-hearted effort to recreate the ginger dream latte they served at this particular tea house, but with no success.
In fact, a few weeks ago John came into the kitchen and smelled ginger and asked what I was making.
“Ginger tea.”
“How much ginger are you using?”
“Like 10 pieces.”
“For ONE CUP?I think you only need like three, for a group of 10.”
“Oh…”

OK, OK, so he was right. I’d seen a recipe on Pinterest but didn’t actually read it (go figure), so I ended up with super concentrated ginger tea with zero sweetness and creaminess.
That was it; I had to remedy the problem. A proper ginger latte WAS happening.

First step: Make ginger syrup. It’s super easy, you just measure 1 part sugar and 1 part water and bring it to a simmer in a saucepan. Then add sliced ginger and let it simmer away for 45 minutes. The result is a sweet, punchy ginger syrup that you can add to cocktails, lattes, and atop baked goods for a gingery sweet glaze.



The only thing left to do is heat up your almond milk and whisk in the syrup.
This recipe is a starting place for a ginger latte, that doesn’t actually include “tea.” If you have ginger tea on hand, steep it in your hot almond milk first, and then add the ginger syrup for sweetness and even more ginger kick. This would send you straight to ginger latte heaven.

What’s it taste like? I was smitten at first sip. It’s:
Creamy
Soothing
Not too sweet
Perfectly gingery
&amp; perfect for an afternoon reprieve, or lazy weekend mornings whilst reading, writing, or whatever your weekend activities might include.

I have been cutting back on caffeine for various reasons, but still love the idea of a hot drink in the morning. So I’ve been enjoying one alongside breakfast when I’m craving something warm and comforting. This latte certainly does the trick. Enjoy!

","To make the ginger syrup, bring the water, sugar, and ginger to a boil and stir to dissolve sugar. Then reduce heat to a low simmer and continue cooking for 45 minutes.Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a bottle or jar for easy storage.To make the ginger latte, heat almond milk in a saucepan or in a mug in the microwave. Then add 1-2 Tbsp ginger syrup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Taste and adjust sweetness as needed. For even more ginger flavor, first steep a ginger tea packet in your almond milk for 3-5 minutes before adding syrup.Sprinkle with a little ginger powder, cinnamon or any other preferred spices, and serve.Ginger syrup should keep in the fridge for up to a month. Use for lattes, as a ginger-infused sweetener in cocktails, or with tonic water to make “ginger soda.”"
703,Vegan Peanut Butter Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"DIY Peanut Butter Chips

By now you know I have a mild obsession with peanut butter. But this takes it to a whole new level. I’ve found a way to make peanut butter a melt-in-your-mouth baking chip! Three high fives for this much-needed discovery.

It’s a given, but the magic starts with peanut butter. Then for sweetness and texture we add agave nectar and powdered sugar. And lastly, to thin it out and help it firm up and keep a “chip” shape, melted coconut oil.

Mixy, mixy mixy time, then pour baby pour.


Next? Pop it in the freezer – the longer the better. But impatient minds will be happy to know that I tested it at 30 minutes and, although it was more prone to softening while cutting, it did work! You’re basically just looking for a very firm sheet that can be easily cut and broken into chips.


Now, these chips arenotlike regular baking chips, which contain preservatives and additives to help them keep their pure shape when baking.
These will soften up a bit more during baking. But the flavor is there 100%. Trust me, I have a cookie recipe featuring these bad boys coming up soon that showcases their peanut buttery glory.

Another difference? You’ve gotta keep these in the freezer to help them stay fresh and keep their shape.
“Boo hoo, that’s a bummer,” you say. Well, I say the benefit of this fragile handling and care is that you get vegan, gluten-free baking chips that are made from four simple ingredients and are additive- and preservative-free! That’s a pretty fair trade-off, no?

So what can you add these chips to? I’m glad you asked…
Cakes
Cookies
Quick breads
Muffins
Ice creams
Sundaes
Waffles
Pancakes
You name it, these will do the trick! Have fun, friends!


","Place a sheet of parchment paper on a rectangular baking pan (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Set aside.To a mixing bowl, add peanut butter, powdered sugar, and agave and stir.Add coconut oil and mix until thoroughly combined. It should be thin and pourable.Pour mixture onto parchment-lined baking sheet and spread with a spatula or spoon until uniformly thin. You don't want it too thick in any one area, so try your best to make sure it's even.Pop in the freezer until very firm - at least 30 minutes, but up to overnight or 4-6 hours. The longer it sets, the easier it will be to cut up and break apart.Once firm, use a knife or pizza cutter to break it into chips. Loosen with a spoon or spatula to help break apart once cut.At this point, especially if your kitchen is warm, the chips will start to soften. These chips need to stay in the freezer!Transfer chips to a freezer safe Tupperware container or bag and store in the freezer until ready for use. When adding to a recipe, keep in the freezer until adding to your batter. And if you batter is too warm (if it's been heated or cooked in some way) it will melt the chips. So be sure to add the chips to a room temp, preferably chilled dough.They will bake as regular baking chips do flavor wise, but because they contain no additives or preservatives to help them keep their shape during baking, they will melt a bit more than store bought. But because these are much more wholesome and natural, I much prefer them to store bought.Will keep in the freezer for 1 month or more. Yields ~2 cups chips."
704,Chocolate Pretzel Peanut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate-Covered Pretzel Peanut Butter

You guys seemed to LOVE the Vegan Peanut Butter Pretzel Truffles I made last month. You proved it all overthe InstagramWeb! Since I had half a bag of pretzels leftover from those beauties – and you likely do, too – I didn’t want them to go to waste. So, I put them to good use in another recipe. Chocolate Covered Pretzel Peanut Butter!

Who doesn’t love a chocolate covered pretzel? Am I right?
Second question: Who doesn’t love peanut butter?
Third question: Who wouldn’t LOVE chocolate covered pretzel peanut butter?
That’s what I wanna know!

This recipe is a 3-ingredient wonder. You just need lightly salted roasted peanuts, pretzels (gluten free for GF eaters) and semisweet dairy-free chocolate.

First you whirl up your pretzels into a meal and set aside. Then you blend your peanuts into a peanut buttery oblivion and add your pretzels back in. Last but not least? Chopped up chocolate. It gets all melty because the peanuts are warm from processing.
Look at that creamy, chocolatey bliss.

One lick and I was in peanut butter cabana heaven. This spread is:
Peanut buttery
Flecked with salty pretzels
Swirled with decadent chocolate
Not too sweet
Perfectly salty
100% shareable
Begging to be spread on anything and everything in your house. People and furniture included.

For starters, I’ve enjoyed mine on a banana, toast, pancakes, and straight outta the jar. Straight up delicious.
I am already highly anticipating spreading it on a waffle. The way it’s bound to settle into the waffle squares is making my mind spin, hamster-in-a-wheel style. I also suspect it would make an excellent addition tochocolate muffins and cupcakes. Basically, anything that’s edible put this spread on it and go to peanut butter town.

Plus, this peanut butter is so customizable. If you’re gluten free, use gluten free pretzels. If you prefer more chocolate, double the amount!

","Place pretzels in a food processor and blend until it resembles meal. Remove and set aside.Place peanuts in the food processor and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping sides down as needed. If it’s having trouble processing, you can add a bit of neutral oil (such as canola). It shouldn’t take more than 8-10 minutes.Add pretzels back in and mix to combine. Taste and then add salt to taste – I used lightly salted peanuts so I only added another 1/2 tsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Last, add chocolate in and pulse a few times to combine. It should get melty immediately from the warmth of the peanut butter.Transfer to a jar or container and keep at room temperature for up to several weeks.Best on toast, pancakes, bananas, waffles and baked goods."
705,1-Hour Vegan Pot Pies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Hour Vegan Pot Pies

Delicious, flaky, veggie-packed vegan pot pies in less than 1 hour. That’s all you need to know.

OK, maybe that’s not ALL you need to know. I can’t talk that little – you know that much by now.
These pot pies come just in time for extra-chilly winter days. They’re warm, rich, comforting, entirely vegan and made completely from scratch. I’m so into these right now.

The filling comes together in one pot in about 20 minutes. While it’s simmering away, thickening into liquid gold, make a batch of my Best Damn Vegan Biscuits! Alternatively, top them with pie crust or store bought biscuits. I just like making mine myself because there’s truly nothing better.
You’ll have leftover biscuits but that just means you can have biscuits with breakfast tomorrow. Is that so bad? (answer: no. No, it’s not.)

Total prep time on these guys is about 35 minutes and they bake up in about 15.
I’ve deemed them the “1-hour vegan pot pie” even though they probably require a little less. But with clean up time included that’s probably more accurate. Besides, you’ll be super impressed with yourself when they’re done in 45 minutes and you feel like a pot pie wizard. You’re welcome.

One bite in and I knew these were spot on. They’re:
Warm
Flaky
Savory
Thick &amp; creamy
Loaded with veggies
Topped with the perfect, flaky biscuit
Buttery
Soul-warming
&amp; So satisfying
Your cold winter bones are aching for this dish, I can sense it. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C).Add 2 Tbsp olive oil to a large saucepan over medium heat (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then add onion and garlic and a pinch of salt – stir. Cook until soft – about 7 minutes.Add the flour and stir with a whisk, then slowly whisk in the broth.Add almond milk and bay leaves and stir. Simmer until the mixture is thickened (about 10 minutes). If it still appears too thin, scoop out 1/2 cup of the broth and add 1-2 Tbsp more flour and whisk (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add back into the pot to thicken. Wait a few minutes. Then repeat if necessary.While the sauce is thickening, prepare biscuits (if using). Cut out, leave unbaked, and set aside.Once the sauce is thickened, add the frozen vegetables and cook for 4-5 more minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt and pepper if needed.Discard the bay leaves and divide the mixture evenly between 5-6 lightly greased ramekins or a 8×8 baking dish (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Top with vegan biscuits and brush the tops of the biscuits with melted vegan butter. Set your 8×8 dish or ramekins on a baking sheet to catch overflow and bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbly (about 14-17 minutes). Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.If making ahead of time, simply spoon the cooked veggie mixture into your ramekins or dish, top with uncooked biscuits, and freeze. When ready to prepare, preheat oven to 425 degrees (218 C) and cook until the biscuits are golden brown and the mixture is bubbly – roughly 20-30 minutes."
706,Kale Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Hide Your Kale Smoothie

Though I’ve known about green smoothies for a long time now, my mind is still blown by that fact that I can rack up 4 servings of fruit and vegbefore the clock ever strikes 8 (or in our house, 11 – don’t judge).

You may or may not already be familiar with green smoothies. But here are two things you may not know about them:
1. You can throw your greens in the freezer so you always have dark leafy, nutrient-packed greens on hand. Look at that! So fancy! And it doesn’t affect the flavor or texture of your smoothie one bit.
2. You can craft a smoothie that completely hides the taste and texture of kale. And not a little kale, like handfuls. Let’s do this!

This smoothie is the same but different than my 5 Ingredient Detox Smoothie. They both contain frozen bananas, frozen berries and fruit juice. But this one hides kale like a boss and is packed with hemp seeds.
“Hey Sheila, why does that matter?” You’re probably thinking…
Well, Sheila and Rhonda, let me tell you. It matters because hemp seeds contain loads of fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals and all 20 of the essential amino acids, including the 9 essential ones. And all of that supports just about every part of your body function. You need hemp seeds in your life, period.

Smoothies are easy. I don’t need to tell you that! Just add everything to a blender and whirl. Yipee!

This smoothie is amazing. It’s:
Creamy
Cold
Satisfying
Perfectly sweet
Loaded with berries
Packed with kale
&amp; Super healthy
And no, you really can’t taste the kale! Make this smoothie and then report back. I’ll wait…

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth, adding more water as needed. Taste and adjust flavors as needed. Add more banana or some agave for added sweetness.Serve immediately – enough for 2."
707,Vegan Banana Cream Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Vegan Banana Cream Pie

I love cashews, I love bananas, I love pie, and I don’t care who knows it!

I truly do love bananas. I eat one nearly every day. So it’s no surprise that my favorite pie is banana cream. But, since I’ve cut out mostly all dairy from my diet I haven’t attempted to make or even take a bite of a banana cream pie in years (*cue: tears). Friends, I was due.

This banana cream pie requires just 10 ingredients including the crust!
Dates + walnuts = crust
Filling = cashews, coconut milk, coconut oil, banana, vanilla, agave nectar, lemon juice, salt

I was once skeptical of cashew-based desserts, but ever since trying these 7 Ingredient Vegan Cheesecakes my mind has been forever changed.
The filling soaked cashews yield is just so creamy, silky sweet and luxurious you can’t beat it. You’d never guess it was dairy free. It doesn’t taste suspect at all.Especially when topped with coconut whipped cream, which is my best friend these days.


The preparation is simple, too. Just process your dates and walnuts in a food processor and press into a springform pan, or a round pan or baking dish lined with plastic wrap if you don’t have a springform (hand raised). Freeze and forget.
Then blend your filling ingredients until creamy and smooth. (You don’t need a Vitamix for this – just a nice quality blender. I use a Kitchenaid.) Pour over the crust, cover and freeze to set. Done and done. The result? Something straight out of heaven.


This pie is perfection. It’s:
Creamy
Luxurious
Sweet
Decadent
Perfectly infused with banana
Super satisfying
&amp; A dream when topped with coconut whipped cream, caramel, and crushed peanuts.
I mean, I can’t make this stuff up. It’s just that good.


Make this pie! You will love it…if you love bananas, that is. My sister balks at them. And she used to be allergic to peanut butter! I have no idea how we’re related. I guess our shared affection for desserts and coffee redeems it all.
However, if bananas really aren’t your thing, fret not. Sub strawberries! Or mangoes! Or blueberries. Just pick your fruit and go. Cheers!




","Place soaked dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and/or it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Process walnuts until a meal consistency is achieved. Add back in dates and a pinch of salt and mix to combine. When squeezed between two fingers, the crust should stick together and feel moldable. If too dry, add another date or two. If too wet, add a little almond or walnut meal.Press into a springform pan, or an 8x8 baking dish or round cake pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment (as original recipe is written // adjust number or size of pan if altering batch size). Press until flat, going up the sides about 1/2 inch. Place in freezer to set.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth and creamy - about 1-2 minutes. If it's having trouble blending, add a little more agave or water to encourage it along. It should be silky smooth when completely combined.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I think adding a heaping spoonful of peanut butter at this point would be a brilliant idea. Then pour into crust and smooth with a spoon. Tap to release any air bubbles. Then cover and freeze until set - about 4-6 hours.To serve, let thaw for 5 minutes. Top slices with coconut whipped cream, crushed peanuts and caramel sauce (optional). Should keep in the freezer, covered, for at least 1 week."
708,Vegan Mashed Potatoes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Damn Vegan Mashed Potatoes

Remember a few weeks back when I made coconut cream pie french toast? Well, this recipe came from the same place of inspiration: while I was working out watching the Food Network. Apparently, it’s my zen place.

Tyler Florence was making a version of mashed potatoes I’d never seen before. He cooked the potatoes in whole milk and cream to produce the creamiest, must luxurious mashed potatoes I’d ever laid eyes on. Obviously, I can’t do dairy because it hates me. So I wanted to try a vegan version to see if it worked sans cream.

Turns out, if you cook potatoes in unsweetened plain almond milk, it really just makes them kind of mealy and they taste like almond milk. Yick. Back to the drawing board. NOW YOU KNOW.
Another few attempts at the best damn vegan mashers yielded massive success. It turns out, you don’t need to cook them in anything other than plain old water. It’s the type of potatoes and mix-ins that make all the difference.

These mashers require 6 simple ingredients:
Yukon gold potatoes
Vegan butter
Roasted garlic (hubba. hubba)
Sea Salt
Black Pepper
&amp; Chives
The result is super creamy, luxurious mashed potatoes with a sweet garlic tone, plenty of S+P, and an herbaceous, light touch from the chives. Give me a spoon, I’m going in.

You will love these taters. They’re:
Thick
Fluffy
Creamy
Buttery
Airy light
Garlicky
Herbaceous
&amp; Altogether satisfying

These mashed potatoes are perfection with a little additional vegan butter, salt, pepper and chives. But they would definitely stand up to and pair well with my 6-Ingredient Mushroom Gravy.
I also intended to make these into potato pancakes (inspired by the Inquiring Chef), but they just never made it that far. I literally ate half of them off of that spoon. OOPS. Sorry but not.
Enjoy!

","Place potatoes in a large saucepan or pot and cover with water. Bring to a light boil over medium-high heat, add 1 tsp of sea salt (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), cover and cook for 25-30 minutes or until very tender. They should effortlessly slide off a knife when pierced with a knife.While the potatoes are cooking, chop up your chives and measure your butter.Once tender, drain your potatoes and place them back in the hot pot off the heat for 1 minute to evaporate any additional water. Then transfer to a large mixing bowl.Mash your potatoes using either a potato masher or a hand mixer until fluffy. Note: Be careful using a hand mixer as you can overmix the potatoes and they can become gluey. It’s personally the method I prefer as I don’t own a potato masher. I just make sure not to overmix.Add in butter, garlic, salt, and black pepper and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Lastly top with chives, stir and serve as is or with your favorite gravy (or mushroom gravy). Leftovers will keep in the fridge covered for up to a few days."
709,Banana Bread Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banana Bread Granola
If you want your house to smell like banana bread without actually baking banana bread, make this granola.
This granola is pretty rad, and provides yet another way to use up overripe bananas; serious score in my book.
The ingredients you need are likely in your pantry RIGHT THIS SECOND. WHOA. EVEN the wet ingredients: coconut oil, agave nectar or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a big ol’ ripe banana.

Look how friggin’ good that looks; and it’s not even baked! Hubba hubba.
Ta-da! Banana bread granola. So delicious + VEGAN &amp; gluten-free! It’s
Crunchy
Nutty
Not too sweet
Super fragrant
JUST like banana bread
&amp; loaded with healthy fats, Omega-3s &amp; 6s, protein ,and fiber
Plus, it takes about 30 minutes start to finish and is the perfect breakfast or on-the-go snack.

John loves his granola over yogurt.I prefer mine straight up withalmond milk(or straight outta the jar #fistfuls).But it also makes the perfect topping for smoothies, creamy oats, frozen yogurt, and ice cream.

If you aren’t a banana fan, sub sweet potato, pumpkin or even beet puree! (Hello hot pink granola! That’s my jam.)
Enjoy!



","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Mix the oats, cinnamon, sugar, salt, flaxseed, and nuts together in a large bowl (see photo).In a small saucepan over medium low heat, warm the coconut oil, maple syrup (or agave or honey), and vanilla extract. Once liquidy, remove from heat and whisk in banana puree until well combined. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix well.Spread the mixture evenly onto one or two baking sheets (making sure it doesn’t get crowded // use additional baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size) and bake for 23-28 minutes or until golden brown. The coconut oil will help it crisp up well, but be sure to watch it carefully as it can brown quickly.NOTE: If you don’t toss the granola while baking, it will get clumpy, which I personally love. But if you want a more crumbly granola, toss/stir a bit at the halfway point to break up the clumps.Once the granola is visibly browned, remove from the oven and toss just a bit to let the heat escape. Cool completely on the baking sheet or in a heat-safe bowl. Store in a container or jar with an air-tight seal – it should keep for a couple of weeks."
710,Ginger Beer Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Ginger Beer Margaritas


Friends, I have been eagerly awaiting the day that I could share this recipe with you.
It is hands down the recipe I am most excited about this month! No, really! Even more than all the desserts (even the cheesecakes) I’ve shared, I am absolutely smitten with this drink! You simply must make it. Promise me this.

This drink is simple – as always – with flavors that were seemingly meant for each other: Ginger beer, simple syrup, fresh lime juice, tequila, and salt for your rim (a must).

When it comes to your tequila, go for something quality. As in, not Jose Cuervo Gold, which I was recently informed is not really tequila (I’ve been lied to all these years and it hurts.) We went with a brand called Altos (no affiliation or partnership, just pure adoration) and we love it.
Just remember, the key to picking a good tequila is: Make sure it’s made with 100% agave. Then you’ll know it’s higher quality and made with the good stuff. This will ultimately affect the quality of your drinks.

This recipe is so easy to make. Just lime your rim with lime juice and salt and then add all of your ingredients with ice to a large glass or cocktail shaker and stir (as to not erupt your ginger beer – lesson learned). Then pour over more ice, garnish with lime, and stir.

What does it taste like? Seriously the best margarita I’ve ever had. And I’ve had a lot of margaritas!(Don’t worry mom, I’m not a drunk – I swear. I just like ritas.)
These guys are:
Perfectly sweet
Tangy from the lime
Crisp from the ginger
&amp;…Really just perfect.
John and I both loved that they showcase the tequila well and don’t overpower it. And they go perfect with any and all Mexican dishes, which is great because we eat some form of tacos at least twice a week. Hello fajitaville and nacho soup.

Simply put: Make these margaritas.
You will love them – I have no doubt. Unless, that is, you don’t like ginger beer. And if that’s the case, GET OFF MY INTERNETZ. (Kidding but not kidding, ok kidding, but really? Who are you?) Cheers!


","Line a small serving glass with fresh lime juice and dip in coarse salt (optional).Add tequila, lime juice, ginger beer, simple syrup, and ice to a large glass or cocktail shaker and stir vigorously. Don't shake with a lid on or it will erupt from the ginger beer carbonation (lesson learned).Pour liquid (reserving ice) into serving glass with a few ice cubes (we just ordered this oversized ice cube mold and LOVE it). Garnish with a lime wedge and serve immediately. Repeat for more drinks, or double/triple the amounts for more people."
711,Peanut Butter Pretzel Truffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter Pretzel Truffles

It’s no secret that peanut butter, pretzel and chocolate go together. They were practically separated at birth, if you think about it. I say, let’s fix that. WHO’S WITH ME?!


This dessert is perfect for Valentine’s Day because it’s salty-sweet, melts in your mouth and is highly shareable. What more could you ask for in a romantic holiday dessert?
But even if V-Day is not romantic for you…
Say, you hate all members of the opposite sex (we’ve been there)
You’re having a bad hair day
Your coworker’s desk is LINED with flowers (ugh, Rhonda)
Your fingernail paint is chipping
Your V-Day plans include watching re-runs of Friends with Ben and Jerry
WHO CARES? Valentine’s Day isn’t about that anyway. It’s about love, and that includes loving yourself. I suggest you start loving yourself by making these 6-ingredient peanut butter pretzel truffles and enjoying a few by the fire. (Or your faux Netflix fire…Gah, I love technology.)


The center of these guys is simple: Pretzels, peanut butter, dates and almonds. That’s it!

And the outside is all chocolate. Choose dark or milk or bittersweet; it’s really your call. I usually opt for bittersweet when making candy because it cooperates best when melted and pairs well with salty flavors.

The only thing left is to sprinkle these with a few more crushed pretzels, or little pretzel pieces.
If you’re about leaving something to the imagination, go for crushed. (It’s like “What’s inside? I DON’T KNOW but the suspense is killing me!)
If you hate mystery like me, go for the broken pieces. (It’s like “Yeah, there’s pretzels in there. YERR GONNA WANT THAT.”)
Ya dig?

You’re gonna love these truffles. They’re:
Peanut buttery
Studded with pretzels
Swimming in chocolate
Salty
Sweet
Shareable
Decadent
Satisfying
&amp; Borderline addictive

Happy candy making, friends! As always, if you make these little gems take a photo and put it onInstagram! Then tag me @minimalistbaker (and don’t be a private user or I can’t see it, and that usually ruins my day). I’d love to see your candy making in action! Hugz.

","Place peanuts and/or almonds in the food processor and process until you reach the consistency of a meal.Then add in pretzels and process until only small bits remain. Remove mixture from bowl and aside.Next, place soaked dates in the food processor and process until small bits remain and/or it forms into a ball.Next, add the peanut butter and mix until well combined.Then add in the pretzel-nut mixture a little at a time and mix until a dough is formed. You shouldn't need to use it all (which is fine because you can use any leftovers for topping the truffles).Once you have a dough that's easy to form into balls, scoop out 1 Tablespoon amounts and roll/carefully form into balls. Set on parchment paper and place in freezer to chill.Next melt chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Once melted, stir in coconut oil to help the chocolate thin and become easier to dip the truffles.Remove truffles from freezer and then, one at a time, dip them into the melted chocolate. Use a fork to remove them and tap away excess chocolate. Transfer back onto parchment paper and top with pretzel pieces or additional crushed pretzels. You will likely have leftover chocolate, which I recommend using to either double dip the truffles or dip pretzels in (because it's fun).Repeat until all truffles are dipped. Place back in the freezer or fridge to set. Store leftovers in an airtight container or bag at room temperature. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage."
712,Easy Vegan Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Cheesecakes

Friends, few times have I been more excited to share a recipe with you as I am today.
This recipe has been taste-tested and approved by 6 of my closest foodie friends and heartily approved. And they weren’t even vegan! I even like these better than real cheesecakes, which I can no longer stomach with my dairy intolerance. Crisis, averted.
These 7 ingredient beauties begin with a 2-ingredient crust! Dates and raw walnuts (or almonds) – that’s all you need. Whirl and set aside.

Next up, the 5-ingredient filling: Soaked cashews, coconut milk, coconut oil, lemon juice and agave nectar. So good, so creamy, so insanely delicious you’ll want to drink it with a straw.

This is where the fun begins: you get to pick your own flavor!
Of course, you could leave them as is. They’re extremely delicious plain. But, to perk them up a bit I created three varieties: blueberry, bourbon caramel, and peanut butter. My favorite being peanut butter (as if you expected anything less).

Instead of baking these cheesecakes you simply pop them in the freezer to set. To make removing them from the pan a breeze, I simply cut out strips of parchment paper and made little tabs so I could just pop them right out. Worked like a charm! If you don’t have parchment, just slide a butter knife along the sides to pop them out. Easy, simple removal either way (no special equipment or springform pans required).


If you’ve ever been suspicious of cashew-based vegan desserts, don’t be!I can wholeheartedly attest that these are some of the best desserts I’ve ever had! No seriously.I can’t even begin to tell you how insanely delicious these guys are – and I’m a cheesecake snob!

They’re:
Creamy
Perfectly sweet
Slightly tart
Luscious
Sexy
Smooth
Insanely satisfying
&amp; Perfect topped with coconut whipped cream
OK, this is beginning to sound like a Victoria’s Secret ad. You catch my drift. Just make, these, cheesecakes!




","Add dates to a food processor and blend until small bits remain and it forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend until a loose dough forms - it should stick together when you squeeze a bit between your fingers. If it's too dry, add a few more dates through the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal. Optional: add a pinch of salt to taste.Lightly grease a standard, 12 slot muffin tin (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen.Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of crust and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. I found the bottom of a glass works well. If it sticks, separate the crust and the glass with a small piece of parchment. Set in freezer to firm up.Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. For the coconut milk, I like to scoop the ""cream"" off the top because it provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together, just add it in as is.You don't need a Vitamix for this recipe, just a quality blender. I mixed mine for 1 minute, then ""liquified"" or ""pureed"" it until silky smooth. If it won't come together, add a touch more lemon juice or agave or a splash more coconut milk liquid as the liquid should help it blend better.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. If adding peanut butter, add to the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with blueberry or caramel, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes (optional).Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours.Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter knife. They should pop right out. Our favorite way to devour these was with a little more caramel and a touch of coconut whipped cream. But they're perfect as is! Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.Optional: You can set them out for 10 minutes before serving to soften, but I liked them frozen as well."
713,Simple Vegan Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Gluten-Free Cookies

Sometimes you want a cookie.
But sometimes you want that cookie to be healthy.
And sometimes you don’t want that cookie to annihilate your kitchen with flour and dishes.
Guess what, these are those cookies! And they so tassssttttyyyyy.

Yep, 5 ingredients. That’s all you need. Forget the eggs, the flax, the sugar, the flour, the butter. All you need is dates, a banana, oats, almond meal and almond butter. Chocolate chips? Those are extra and optional. But who are we kidding? YERR gonna want those.


Another perk of these gems? The batter comes together in a food processor!
Of course, if you don’t have a food processor you could still make these in a regular mixing bowl, but it’s way more fun to whirl it around with a blade until pulverized. It’s the baker’s equivalent of a punching bag for stress. Let it out, girl. I feel your pain…



After about 15 minutes in the oven these babes are ready for your mouth.They taste similar in flavor to our Vegan Gluten Free Everything Breakfast Cookies but require one-third of the ingredients and far less time. That’s my kinda (healthy) cookie. These guys are:
Hearty
Slightly chewy
Wholesome
Not overly sweet
Studded with chocolate (if you dare)
&amp; Highly shareable
Or not. Or just eat them all yourself. I won’t tell.

These cookies are so healthy they could actually be breakfast or a post-workout snack. I enjoyed mine during afternoon slumps and after dinner when I was craving something sweet (aka always). But, enjoy them as you wish. It’s your cookie, friend. Go wild.


","Add dates to a food processor and pulse until small bits remain.Add banana and almond butter and mix again until combined, scraping down the sides as needed.Next add the almond meal and rolled oats and pulse until a loose dough is formed. It will be kind of wet and sticky. That’s OK! You’re on the right track.Scrape your dough into a mixing bowl. If it feels too wet to the touch to form into cookies, add another few Tbsp of almond meal and/or oats and stir. I added another few tablespoons of each until I was able to form them into cookies without them sticking to my hands.At this point, you can add in 1/4 cup of your mix-in of choice, such as dairy-free dark chocolate chips, raisins or nuts. Then chill dough for 10 minutes and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Scoop out 1 Tbsp amounts of your cookie dough and form into loose discs, then arrange on a parchment lined baking sheet. They won’t expand so pack them closer together (but not touching).Bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown and somewhat firm to the touch. The good thing about these cookies is a little under-baked is OK since there’s no eggs and they’ll ultimately just be a little more moist.Remove and let set for a few minutes on the pan, then carefully transfer to a plate or cooling rack to cool. Serve immediately.Store leftovers in an airtight container for several days. Move to the fridge or freezer for longer term storage."
714,Simple Vegan Hot Chocolate | minimalist baker recipes,"5-Minute Vegan Hot Cocoa
You guys, it’s cold. I mean, seriously cold.
We may have narrowly escaped the polar vortex but I’m still feeling its aftermath. Most days John and I hunker down inside next to space heaters. But when I just can’t kick a chill – or am having a serious chocolate craving – I make my favorite 5 minute (or less) vegan hot cocoa.
It’s such a simple recipe it’s almost a non-recipe. But I asked Facebook fans if they’d be interested and the answer was a resounding ‘yes.’ So, here it is – my go-to homemade hot chocolate that’s way better (and healthier) than any packaged or boxed mix you’ll find.
It starts with simple ingredients:
Unsweetened vanilla or plain almond milk (or make your own!)
Unsweetened cocoa powder
Dairy-free semisweet or dark chocolate
Raw sugar or stevia
You can make this in the microwave in a big mug – I use my big yellow cereal mug that I’ve had since high school and have carried with me like an adult blankie. Or, if you’re not into the microwave or would rather go old school, simply add ingredients to a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and whisk away. Creamy perfection is just 5 minutes away.
Next I like to add a little extract. I know everyone usually recommends adding vanilla to “bring out the flavor of the chocolate” or something like that. But I’ve been on a chocolate peppermint kick for the last few months, so I put in a drop or two of peppermint extract and it sends my tastebuds straight to heaven.
The last element? Coconut whipped cream. I mean, hubba hubba. Also, WHY NOT? It really does put the finishing touch on the cocoa and gives it that luscious, creamy effect I just adore.
And there you have it! My 5-Minute Vegan Hot Cocoa. I hope you make it a lot this winter to keep warm. And if you do, Instagram me a photo – it’s kind of my favorite. Then we can be warm together via internet.

","Add almond milk to a large mug and microwave for 1 minute. Alternatively, add to a saucepan over medium heat.Once milk is warm, add cocoa powder, chocolate and sweetener and whisk to combine.Put back in microwave or continue cooking on stovetop until completely combined and has reached your preferred temperature.Taste and adjust sweetness as needed.Lastly, add in your extract of choice – I think peppermint is truly unbeatable. Stir, and top with coconut whipped cream."

Growing up, my sister and I were both heavily involved in sports. Softball, basketball, track, soccer, volleyball…we did it all. In at least 30% of those sports, our dad was our coach. I guess we liked to keep it in the family – still not sure if that was a good idea or not. I’ll get back to you on that one.
When I was still a bit younger and learning the ropes in basketball, I would go to my sister’s rec league games on weekends and watch the older kids play. My dad would coach – naturally – and I got to sit in the stands next to my mom who was feverishly – and poorly – filming the action, missing whole segments of the game when she’d get worked up over plays, put down the camera and start yelling at the players and referees. My mom is 5’2″ and weighs a buck ten. She’s pint sized and she means business. It’s hilarious and adorable and terrifying all at the same time. Trust me, I was there.
Obviously, these games were the best. Don’t worry, I’m getting to the candy part…

Between quarters I’d swindle a few bucks out of my mom and mosey down to the concession stand – one of the main reasons I loved sports at that age. Play a game, get a snow cone. I’m in.
My sugar of choice at the time was either Snicker’s or Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Snickers were more of a grocery store check out line operation (please mom? please?). But Reese’s? All ball game. There were two, they were salty and sweet, and they achieved the perfect melt in the muggy heat of an old gym filled with sweaty pre-adolescent bodies. Plus, not too much to fill you up so you still have room for nachos and whatnot. I was methodic about my candy even at 6.
More bizarre than my selection theory was my method of consumption. I would only take bites when my sister scored a basket or did something “good.” She made a good pass, bite. She made a free-throw, bite. She made a 3-pointer? Two bites. I had my tactics down.

This just proves my storied and colorful history with peanut butter cups.
But it wasn’t until adulthood that I fell in love with almond butter. Upon trying my first almond butter cup I was hooked. Not necessarily better than peanut butter (don’t get it twisted), but seriously up there. It was only natural to explore flavor combinations, especially since somebody in this house is obsessed with all-things caramel.

Besides, I needed an excuse to make another batch of my 4-ingredient bourbon caramel sauce. 6 months without that stuff is 7 months too long if you catch my drift.

These cups are pretty straight forward, taking about 15 minutes total to make once you have your caramel sauce ready (add 15 minutes). And though they take a little fancy handwork with tipping, filling and pouring, the effort is undeniably worth it. I mean, look at these things. C’mon.


After a quick chill these guys are ready to go straight into your mouth. I reluctantly shared half of this batch with friends so I wouldn’t immediately engulf the entire recipe all by myself. (Trust me, I would so hide these from John all over the house and sneak bites when he wasn’t looking. At least I’m honest.)

These are the perfect DIY candies for Valentine’s Day and beyond. They’re:
Dark chocolatey
Almond buttery
Sweet
Rich
Drenched in caramel
Offset with a pinch of salt on top
Highly gift-able
&amp; Sharable
In other words, perfection in cup form.

I don’t employ the same consumption methods as I once clung to in my youth. There’s less waiting involved as these cups call for a quick chop in half to let the caramel ooze out, followed by a messy scramble to get in every nibble before the caramel escapes your grasp. It’s like a game – a drippy, delicious candy game. The best kind of game.
Enjoy these cups, OK? I mean, there’s no way you possibly wouldn’t. Seriously. It’s science.




","Melt your chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30-second increments.Set out 12 mini paper liners and rest them in a mini muffin tin if you have it (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Otherwise, just set them on a plate close together. If you don't have mini paper liners, use regular size ones instead - it should make half as many (~7 as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Once your chocolate is melted, spoon about 1 heaping teaspoon of chocolate into each liner and use a small brush or back of a spoon to swirl the chocolate around and coat the bottoms and almost all the way up the sides. You want to make sure your fillings are fully contained, so be sure it's well coated.Next, mix together your almond butter and powdered sugar, adding enough sugar and stirring until you have almost a dough that's almost workable with your hands. Spoon out heaping 1/2 Tablespoon measurements and plop them into the liners, nestling them in the chocolate. Tap down with finger to smooth out any lumps.Next, top with about 1 tsp of caramel - enough to seep into the cracks and just barely cover the almond butter. Don't overfill unless you want messy cups (which I'm totally OK with).Lastly, top with remaining melted chocolate and use a brush or spoon to smooth and seal the edges. Sprinkle with a touch of sea salt (optional) and set in the fridge or freezer to set.You can store these at room temp, in the fridge or in the freezer, though I prefer the freezer because it keeps the caramel set and they're a little easier to eat that way."

OK, here’s what you need to do. Call your favorite person – your best friend, your spouse, your secret crush, your cute neighbor, your therapist, whoever – and tell them to come over to your house for a delicious vegan treat. LAVA CAKES. Hubba hubba.
If you haven’t caught on yet, my new favorite phrase is “hubba hubba.” But hey! Can I really help it? Look at the goodness that is these healthy, beet-powered chocolate lava cakes! Valentine’s Day is gonna rock so hard this year, single or not.
These lava cakes were initially inspired by a version I tried in Bali last summer. But I have to be honest. The one I tried at a practically 5-star restaurant wasn’t that good! I immediately thought “I can do this better.” And, I did! Vegan and butter-free style. Plus, coconut whipped cream &gt; dairy whipped cream.
The ingredients for these cakes are simple:
Pureed beets
Cocoa Powder
Coconut oil
Cane sugar
Semisweet chocolate
Unbleached flour
Vanilla
A few other basic baking essentials round out the rest of the ingredients. And if you don’t have beets, you can sub applesauce. The best part? These little gems come together in about 30 minutes (post beet-roasting) andrequire one bowl! Score.

What do they taste like?
Warm
Fudgy
Chocolaty
Rich
Cakey on the outside
Mega moist in the middle
Perfect with coconut whipped cream or ice cream
&amp; Begging to be shared with a friend or significant other
If you share this with anyone they will be your best friend for your life – there’s just no getting around it.
Good news!These cakes are the first of SEVEN vegan Valentine’s Day recipes I have in the works.
Expect some indulgent, some raw, some heatlhy, some chocolaty, some hot pink! I listened to your votes on Facebook and have come up with quite a varied list. BE STOKED! And in the meantime, eat cake. Cheers!

Break up one square of the dark chocolate and push it down into the centers of the cakes. Cover with batter using a spoon. Bake 15-20 minutes, or until the edges have pulled away slightly and the top no longer appears wet. It's OK if it's a little fudgy but you definitely don't want underdone cake.Let rest in the pan for 4-5 minutes before removing. Then gently loosen the edges with a butter knife and top with a cutting board or plate and carefully invert. Gently transfer to serving plates. Immediately top each cake with the remaining square of vegan dark chocolate (for extra gooey-ness - optional) and serve with coconut whipped cream.

717,Vegan Banana Crumb Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Banana Crumb Muffins
Banana muffins – perhaps my favorite muffin in all of muffin land (except maybe chocolate chocolate chipon occasion, but don’t tell banana or her feelings may get hurt).
I discovered perhaps the best small batch vegan banana muffin recipe last year when I fiddled around until perfecting my jumbo muffin for 2 recipe. I mean, those things are bomb. As in, exceptional. The only next option was to quadruple the recipe and bring these muffins to the next level with a CRUMB TOPPING. Yeah, I said it.
Muffin enthusiasts know everything is better with a crumb top – it’s fact.

Bring on the crumb topping! Raw sugar, vegan butter, unbleached flour – that’s it! And you have crumbs galore.

These muffins are simple in 2 ways:
1) They require 1 BOWL
2) They require about 30 minutes
BAM. Simple indulgence as its finest.
How do they taste? Amazey-face.
Moist
Perfectly sweet
Crumbly on top!
Packed with banana flavor
Wholesome
Hearty
Filling
&amp; Utterly perfect with coffee
It really doesn’t get any better than this.
Make these muffins for breakfast, for snacking, a healthy dessert, treats for your birthday at the office (Do people still do that? Whatever. HELLO PROMOTION.), or keep them all to yourself. Whatever you do, don’t be a fool and ignore these little gems. They couldn’t take the heartbreak.
And if you do make them, Instagram me a photo! I love it when people do that (no seriously, it’s kind of my favorite).

718,Coconut Cream Pie French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Cream Pie French Toast
The other day I was running on the treadmill in our apartment gym and I flipped on the Food Network – literally the only channel I watch TV for.
Lucky for me the show on at the time was all about the best foods featured chefs had ever made. The recipe that immediately caught my eye and got my mind spinning was Paine Perdu – the most decadent, mind-blowing take on french toast ever. It, was, on.
I immediately ran upstairs and told John I had a recipe idea. The original recipe was LOADED with dairy in the form of half and half and butter – things I really can’t handle. So I wanted to make version that was just as decadent yet dairy-free. That fastest way to get decadence without dairy fat? COCONUT MILK. Plus, it just so happens that my favorite pie is coconut cream pie, so that flavor application was kind of a given.
This french toast starts at night – a step that’s not entirely necessary but recommended. The batter includes:
Coconut milk
Almond milk
Eggs
Vanilla
Agave nectar
&amp; Raw sugar
Whisk it all together then toss in your crusty bread (gluten free even!). Get some zzz’s and in the morning you’re ready to bake.
Because the slices of french toast are so thick, we first fry them up on both sides to get some color, and then finish them off in the oven to make sure they get cooked all the way through. After 10 or so minutes in the oven they’re just begging to be served and smothered with coconut cream pie toppings.

For starters, coconut whipped cream.

Ooh, baby. Next? MAPLE SYRUP.
Last but not least? Toasted coconut flake.

All right, seriously. Now we’re talkin’.
This french toast is INSANE. It’s:
Slightly crisp on the outside
Tender and custard-like in the middle
Sweet and decadent
Loaded with coconut cream pie flavor
&amp; Perfect for feeding a crowd (1 slice per person is plenty)
After cooking mine up, I devoured a slice, John had one as well, and the rest went down to some very happy staff at our apartment who received the dish with big eyes and hungry bellies. The verdict? Some of the best french toast EVER, especially if you’re a coconut cream pie fan like me.
Enjoy!




","In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the coconut milk, almond milk, vanilla extract, sugar, agave nectar, sea salt and eggs.Arrange your bread in a shallow, rectangular dish and pour your wet mixture over the bread. Let set for 5-10 minutes, then turn the bread over to soak the other side. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 4-6 hours. (You will have leftover batter after cooking the french toast, which you can reserve for later use if desired.)The next day, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Heat one large or two medium oven-safe pans over medium-high heat and add the butter or coconut oil. In the meantime, sprinkle some raw sugar on top of the bread slices. Working quickly, place the bread in the pan sugar side down and cook for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Sugar the top side.Flip the bread over and transfer the pan(s) to the oven until cooked through - about 12-15 minutes. It should have a nice, dark golden brown color and be puffed up.Carefully remove from oven and plate - 1 slice per person is plenty. Serve with coconut whipped cream, toasted coconut flake and maple syrup."
719,Patatas Bravas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Patatas Bravas
You probably you have that one obnoxious friend who has traveled the world and can’t shut up about it. Well, I fear I’m becoming that person, sharing all of these travel-inspired recipes lately. But that’s certainly not what I’m trying to do! I just can’t help but share the amazing and awesome food I experienced while away from the U.S.
There’s a lot of great food out there and I simply think you should know! One such dish being PATATAS BRAVAS. Oh, lordy. I would go BACK to Spain just to have patatas bravas. True story.

It all starts with crispy quartered potatoes. Some versions are fried, I was not about to go there (#terrifiedofgrease). Plus, baked taste just as good if not better than fried. And you can have twice as many since they have half the calories – it’s science.

The thing that makes this dish special is the tomato sauce. Although there many versions out there, some even, including a garlic aioli as a second sauce, I wanted to keep things simple. The sauce itself comes together in about 20 minutes including prep time and requires super basic ingredients:
Tomato paste or canned tomatoes
Salt
Garlic cloves + powder
Cayenne
Paprika
Hot sauce
&amp; Onion
It’s very similar to the sauce for the simple baked eggs, only more vinegary, spicier, and less chunky. Perfect for pouring atop crispy baked potatoes. #YUM

If you want to keep this dish vegan, stop here. But if you’re up for another layer of flavor, bring on the Parmesan! I highly recommend it, as it’s a simple alternative to making aioli, which requires 5 more ingredients.
Last but not least, HERBS! I went with cilantro, but parsley is perhaps more traditional. Besides adding more color, it adds freshness and an earthy flavor that I love.

And there you have it. SIMPLE Patatas Bravas with a kick. This dish is:
Spicy
Savory
One word – POTATOES
Perfect for a crowd (tapas anyone?)
Customizable
Tomato-y
Garlicky
&amp; Super satisfying
Make this a complete meal by adding a runny egg on top (seriously amazing). Otherwise, serve as a traditional Spanish appetizer or “tapas.” We ate these EVERYWHERE when we were in Spain. So good! They’re probably my favorite appetizer of ALL TIME. Sorry chips &amp; salsa, you were good for a little while but…you’ve been replaced.
Enjoy!


","Soak quartered potatoes in very hot water for 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Once potatoes are soaked, dry thoroughly and then add to a baking sheet with olive oil and a generous sprinkling of sea salt and garlic powder. Toss to coat.Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through, stirring once. Test by spearing a potato with a toothpick – it should be relatively easy to push through.While the potatoes are baking, prepare your spicy tomato sauce. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic and 1/2 tsp salt and stir. Cook for 7-8 minutes to slowly “sweat” until the mixture becomes translucent and very fragrant. If it begins brown, turn down the heat to low and stir frequently.Add paprika, garlic powder, cayenne and stir. Then add tomato paste, hot sauce and water and stir. Cook for 10-12 minutes or until simmering and the flavors are well blended. Reduce heat if it begins to bubble too vigorously. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more hot sauce, sea salt and garlic powder.For a smooth sauce (which I prefer), puree in a blender or food processor until smooth. Otherwise, set aside.Remove potatoes from oven and sprinkle with a bit more salt to taste. Place in 3-4 small serving dishes and drizzle with tomato sauce (as original recipe is written // adjust number of serving dishes if altering batch size). Optional additional toppings include vegan parmesan cheese, more hot sauce, and fresh herbs."
720,1-Pot Vegan Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Vegan Pasta
You guys know I love simple. Well it doesn’t get any simpler than this: 1-pot pasta. Yep, all the ingredients in ONE POT. I think I’m in love.
I’m not sure where this idea originated – probably Martha Stewart herself. But I love it. Not that pasta is super complicated anyway, but to create an even smaller mess and save time is a double upgrade if you ask me.
This dish starts with plenty of veggies: Mushrooms, eggplant and fresh parsley. You start by sauteeing your veggies in a big pot or pan and then setting them aside. Next comes the pasta, tomato sauce, garlic, water and seasonings into the SAME POT. Super easy stuff.
Then you literally just bring it to a boil, cover it, and let it simmer until the noodles are al dente. All that’s left to do is taste, adjust seasonings, and throw the veggies back on. So simple. So good.

This dish is:
Light yet filling
Fresh
Rich with tomato flavor
Full of good-for-you veggies
Vegan (and gluten-free optional)
&amp; (best of all) EASY
Plus, it’s extremely customizable. Use your pasta of choice, sub in your favorite veggies, throw in fresh herbs, roast your garlic, top with cheese – the options are endless. Enjoy!

","Rinse and dice eggplant into small, bite-sized cubes. Place in a colander in the sink and sprinkle generously with salt to draw out some of the moisture. Wait 20-30 minutes. Then rinse and pat thoroughly dry with a towel. Set aside. If you’re short on time, skip the eggplant and double the mushrooms.Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add olive oil, the eggplant and 1/3 of the minced garlic (1 clove as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp sea salt (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Sauté for 3-5 minutes or until a golden brown color is achieved, then add the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes more or until all of the veggies have color. Set aside and cover – you will top the pasta with it.To the same saucepan, add the pasta, water, marinara sauce, the remaining cloves of garlic. Start with 1.5 tsp sea salt and 1 tsp black pepper (you will likely add more later depending on the saltiness of your marinara/your personal taste // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Bring mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer until the pasta is cooked to al dente – will vary depending on kind of pasta – but typically an average of 10 minutes, stirring once or twice so it doesn’t stick to the pan.Once cooked, stir and taste to adjust seasonings. I added more salt and fresh herbs at this point.Remove from heat and top with eggplant-mushroom mixture and more fresh parsley or basil. Serve immediately. Serves 3-4 (as original recipe is written)."
721,Vegan Peanut Butter Swirl Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Swirl Brownies
Several years ago I discovered the wonders of black bean brownies. Since then I haven’t stopped dreaming of ways to reinvent them. Friends, this one has been a long time coming. I present: Peanut Butter Swirl Black Bean Brownies! Yes, gluten-free AND vegan! Whoop whoop!

It all starts with a luxurious batter that comes together in the bowl of your food processor. That’s right. No hand mixing or beating required. Just dump and whirl. It’s as easy as it gets.
You can even mix up your peanut butter swirls in the measuring cup! Look ma, no extra dishes!

Once you drop, swirl and whirl it’s into the oven. Depending on if you use an 8×8 or muffin tins, time will vary. But the important thing is the edges pull away and there’s no more jiggle. Yes, we want fudgy insides but no, we don’t want jiggle (no matter how vegan these are).

The finished product was AMAZING.
Fudgy
Chocolaty
Peanut Buttery
Cakey on the edges
Mega moist in the middle
Totally decadent
&amp; Satisfying
Can someone remind me again how these are vegan and gluten-free?
Hubba hubba. Make these little gems! For Valentine’s Day, birthdays, anniversaries, special occasions (any occasions). Just make these brownies! You NEED them in your life. Enjoy!


","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Lightly grease an 8x8 baking pan or a 12-slot standard size muffin pan (not mini // as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Prepare flax eggs by combining flaxseed meal and water in the bowl of the food processor. Pulse a couple times and then let rest for a few minutes.Add remaining ingredients through baking soda and puree – about 3 minutes – scraping down sides as needed. You want it pretty smooth.If the batter appears too thick, add a Tbsp or two of water and pulse again. It should be slightly less thick than chocolate frosting but nowhere close to runny. Add almost all of the chocolate chips and stir.Evenly distribute the batter into the 8x8 or muffin tins and smooth the tops with a spoon or your finger.Measure out peanut butter in a mixing cup and add in powdered sugar - mix to combine.To the brownie pan, add dots of the peanut butter powdered sugar mixture and swirl with a toothpick or knife. Sprinkle top with a few more chocolate chips or shaved chocolate.Bake for 20-26 minutes if using muffin tins or 35-45 minutes if using an 8x8 dish. You want the top dry and the edges to start to pull away from the sides. It shouldn't be jiggly when shaken.Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes in the pan before serving. They will be tender, so remove gently with a spatula or fork. If they're too tender, let set in the freezer to stiffen so they're easier to lift out. The insides are meant to be very fudgy, so don’t be concerned if they seem too moist – that’s the point. Plus, they’re vegan, so it doesn’t really matter.Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. Refrigerate to keep longer."
722,Tom Kha Gai with Butternut Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tom Kha Gai Butternut Squash Soup
If you ever have the chance to travel, do it. It has been one of the most challenging experiences I’ve ever endured – hello jet lag, language barriers and heavy backpacks – but it was also one of the most fun and educational.
Perhaps my favorite element of travel is expanding my horizons, whether it’s observing how other people do life, learning to speak another language or exploring new cuisines. Such cuisines were Thai and Indonesian. Though very simple, straight-forward dishes, they were always fresh, inventive and incredibly flavorful.
One example of this? Tom kha gai.
Tom kha gai is a broth- and coconut milk-based soup whose primarily flavors are ginger (or galangal), lemongrass and chili. I have a simplified version of it in our upcoming 31 Meals cookbook (to be released any day now!) But I got it in my head to make a version with butternut squash because I imagined the flavors melding together so well. Turns out, they totally do.
Tom kha gaitypically features chicken as the primary protein, along with a few mushrooms for more heartiness and texture. But I kept this version vegan friendly and upped the veggie count with an entire roasted butternut squash! Look at that creamy goodness. I could hardly wait to give it a try.
Though this soup may be foreign to some, the ingredients are fairly common and easy to attain:
Butternut squash
Vegetable broth
Coconut milk
Ginger
Lemongrass
Shallot
Thai chili (or other hot pepper)
Mushrooms
&amp; fish sauce (optional)

On its own, this soup has TONS of flavor. But the addition of butternut squash makes it even more creamy and luxurious and perfect for slurping down while hunkered down inside during harsh winter weather.Trust me, this is practically all we did last week. Wake up, stay in jammies, hot cocoa, soup, back to bed. And it, was, wonderful.
I highly recommend you do the same. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees (204 C). Add butternut squash to a baking sheet and toss with 2 Tbsp olive or coconut oil and a bit of sea salt. Roast for 12-15 minutes or until tender and cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly.In the meantime, add coconut milk, vegetable broth, ginger, lemongrass, and shallot to a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil. Then lower heat to a simmer. Add fish sauce (optional) and sliced pepper and stir.Add butternut squash to a food processor or blender with 1 cup of the broth and puree until smooth (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add back into the soup and stir until well combined. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes more.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more ginger and a pinch more salt at this point.Before serving, discard lemongrass (if you used fresh stalks – otherwise ignore this instruction). Garnish with fresh lime juice (HIGHLY recommended), fresh basil and cilantro.This would be lovely over rice or on its own. Store leftovers covered in the fridge for several days. Freeze for longer term storage."
723,Vegan Double Chocolate Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Double Chocolate Beet Muffins
When I was in high school my mom used to packed my lunch for me every day before I left for school. I know, I was totally spoiled. More on this fact here and here. But despite having a wholesome, homemade meal as mid-day fuel I always craved just a little something more. You know, something sweet. Something chocolate. Something like, an Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate chocolate muffin.
Don’t mind if I do, eat-it-cold-with-my-bare-hands while my friends watch in horror. #truestory
But here’s the deal. I don’t even want to know what was in those things. And I’m pretty sure each one had at least 400 calories and loads of fat and sugar. Knowing that now, I avoid them at all costs. But that doesn’t mean I don’t crave a moist, chocolate chocolate chip muffin once in a while.
My solution? Make them healthier.

This recipe starts with one seriously healthy ingredient: Beet puree! An entire cup of beet puree – equals out to about two whole beets – goes into a dozen, naturally-sweetened, whole grain muffins that also happen to be vegan. I didn’t even know such deliciousness was possible without butter, sugar and milk.

Despite their intenseappearance, these muffins are actually super simple once you get your beets pureed, requiring just one bowl and 30 minutes to prepare. And the ingredients are simple and wholesome:
flaxseed
beets
agave nectar
brown sugar
salt &amp; baking soda
coconut oil
almond milk
cocoa powder
whole-wheat pastry flour
&amp; dairy-free chocolate chips
If you have those things on hand, you’re in business. I mean, you’re in SERIOUS business. Look at these beauties!

I was so pleased with how they turned out. They’re:
Moist
Fudgy
Super chocolaty
Filling
&amp; Altogether satisfying
Way better than the muffin of my yesteryear, but with all of the satisfying, chocolaty taste I remember and love.
Another perk? Each muffin boasts just 170 calories! I’m not big on counting calories myself – I believe more in intuitive eating. But I couldn’t help but brag about how nutritionally dense yet calorically modest they are! That means you can eat at least 2-3 at any given moment, right? OK good, that’s what I thought.
Enjoy these muffins with breakfast, as a snack, or a late-night dessert. I personally chose to share mine with friends – a.k.a. in a safe environment where I wouldn’t inhale half the batch before I realized what just happened. Bake them, share them or keep them for yourself. Whatever you do, justmakethem! You’ll fall in hardcore vegan love with these little guys. Enjoy!

","See this post for instructions on roasting a beet. Otherwise, you could sub another fruit puree, such as butternut squash or applesauce.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line 12 muffins with paper liners, or lightly grease (as original recipe is written // adjust number of muffins if altering batch size).Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add beet puree, melted oil, maple syrup or agave, brown sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk for 45 seconds.Stir in the almond milk and whisk once more.Add cocoa powder and flours and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined, being careful not to over-mix. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk. But it should be quite thick and NOT pourable – rather, scoopable.Lastly, stir in chocolate chips. Then divide batter evenly between muffin tins (should be enough for between 11-12 as original recipe is written) and sprinkle with a few more chocolate chips (optional but recommended).Bake for 17-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

724,Vegan Peanut Butter Mousse | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Mousse
Peanut butter is one of my favorite foods. In fact, I think I ate it so much growing up that my body started telling me to slow my consumption. There would be days in college that I’d put peanut butter in my oatmeal at breakfast, peanut butter in my smoothie at lunch, then have a peanut butter and jelly wrap at dinner. Whoops. What can I say! I love this creamy, salty nut butter.
So why then, I ask, not make it into a healthy, 3-ingredient mousse so I can put it on everything? That’s what I want to know!
The basis of this recipe is simple:
Coconut whipped cream + peanut butter + sweetener of choice
I went for agave nectar, but you could also use maple syrup, powdered sugar, or stevia for a lighter option.
Whip, whip, whip. Then bring on the peanut butter!

This delicious spread doubles as both a stand-alone dessert – peanut butter mousse – as well as a healthier peanut butter frosting. I would put this on brownies, muffins or cupcakes and go to town.Another option? Protein-boosted fruit dip! Put this on a banana and experience instant bliss. Go wild and put it on everything (including drinking chocolate for the win – yeah I said it).
Dig in!


","Chill your coconut milk overnight. In the morning, without shaking or tipping, remove the lid and scoop out the solid cream from the top into a chilled bowl. Leave the liquid in the bottom of the can and reserve it for use in smoothies, baked goods, etc. (If your coconut milk didn't harden, see this post for tips on how to save it.)Using a mixer, beat until creamed together, light and fluffy - about 45 seconds.Add peanut butter, starting with lower end of range (2 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and adding from there to desired taste.Add sweetener of choice to desired sweetness, observing that the more liquid you add the less firm the mousse will be.Either use immediately as a spreadable frosting, or chill for several hours to let it set and firm up as a mousse.Eat as a mousse topped with plain coconut whipped cream, bananas or chocolate sauce. Alternatively, use as a dip for fruit/baked goods. If using as a frosting, don't frost your muffins, cookies and cakes, etc., until just before serving as it needs to be chilled right up until serving.Reserve leftovers in a covered container in the fridge. Will keep for up to 1 week."
725,Vegan Tortilla Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Loaded Veggie Nacho Soup
Sometimes eating healthy is really hard. You eat well for a while but inevitably begin to miss the familiar, comforting foods that are no longer on your menu.This has happened to me many times over. But, I have a solution, and that’s to get creative; to modify and find ways around restrictions and rules so I can still enjoy my food without ditching my healthy eating habits.
The good news ? This soup satisfies both requirements. It has all the taste of the hearty, comforting dishes you love plus all of the nutritional and health benefits and whole foods ingredients your body craves. Plus, it’s easy, vegan and gluten free – a win-win for all parties involved.
Originally I set out to make a tortilla soup mixed with a vegan chili. The name didn’t hit me until I was taking my first bites and thought, “Wow, this tastes exactly like nachos!” The crunchy chips on top and all of the traditional nacho toppings had me totally sold. It’s like healthy food and comfort food all wrapped into one.
These DIY baked chili cheese fritos are perfection on top of this soup. But you can also just use tortilla chips for a quicker, easier option.
What I love about this soup:
1) It comes together in about 30 minutes.
2) Is rich and hearty with the perfect balance of tomato-y thickness and savory broth.
3) And is loaded with veggies: onion, tomato, chilis, fresh salsa, plus fresh avocado and red onion on top. Cilantro would also make a brilliant addition.
Dream big, friends, and don’t skimp on toppings. That’s my motto.
I think we’ll be seeing a lot of this soup this winter. It’s so perfect for cold weather, plus makes enough to feed you for at least two if not three meals. Make it your own and adjust the heat, toppings and yield to best suit your family. It’s extremely customizable and thoroughly delicious. Enjoy!

","Heat a large pot over medium heat.Add olive oil, onion, garlic and sir. Cook for about 5 minutes or until softened and transparent. Turn down heat if the garlic starts to brown.Add salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder and stir to coat. Then add tomato paste, water, veggie broth, salsa, green chilis and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then add black beans. Bring to a simmer again, reduce heat to low and cook for another 20-30 minutes.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more spices, salt or pepper. Add hot sauce for more heat.Serve hot with tortilla chips or DIY chili cheese fritos, fresh onion, avocado or guacamole, fresh cilantro, etc. Add grated cheese or sour cream for non-vegan options."
726,Baked Chili Cheese Fritos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Chili Cheese Fritos
One of my favorite foods growing up was frito chili pie. I know, so not healthy – guilty as charged. But so good! Loads of crunchy, salty fritos topped with hearty chili and handfuls of cheese – so delicious. And no veggies in sight; just the way I liked it back then. Oops.
But worry not! Things have changed. I love veggies now. In fact, most nights I request “something with tons of veggies” for dinner. It’s John’s favorite (eye roll).
More evidence of my ever-evolving healthy palette is my love for baked things over fried things. Baked chipsare (almost) as good as the real thing. So when I recently re-discovered my love for homemade tortilla chips andtortilla soup via the ever-talented Kate, I couldn’t help but dream to recreate my old favorite: chili cheese fritos.
These fritos are so simple and you likely already have all the ingredients on hand. You just need the spices listed above, corn tortillas and a little oil. I also added a pinch of nutritional yeast for a vegan-friendly “cheese” flavor, but it is certainly optional.
The best and easiest part, in my opinion? Once baked you just have to find something to bury them under. Like I said, BEST PART EVER.
While these chips don’t taste exactly like the original, they are seriously close and way better for you since there’s no frying and zero questionable ingredients involved. Just tortillas, spices and olive oil – straight forward food.Junk food made healthy, indeed. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 380 degrees F (193 C).Add all spices and seasonings to a large bowl and whisk until well combined. Set aside.Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut your tortillas into equal strips (see photo).Transfer to baking sheet and toss in oil until well coated.Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Watch out, they’ll burn quickly past the 14- to 15-minute mark.Once removed from the oven, immediately add tortilla strips to the seasoning mix and toss to coat. If they appear to have dried in the oven while baking, you can spritz them with a little oil so the seasonings stick better.Transfer to a serving bowl or plate with a slotted spatula to shake off excess seasoning. You’ll likely have extra seasoning, which you can store for later use if desired.Serve immediately with chili, soup or dips. Store leftovers in a storage bag or Tupperware at room temp for up to a couple of days, though best when fresh."
727,Chocolate Almond Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Thick DIY Chocolate Almond Milk
Perhaps the best part of driver’s ed my freshman summer of high school – besides the invaluable lessons I gained in conducting myself on the road, of course – was my instructor, Wendell. Not only did he have the innate ability to grunt instructions without sounding cross, he loved donuts. A man after my own heart.
Wendell took a poll one day and we all agreed that we should steer our school’s light blue driver’s ed van toward the Lamar’s Donuts one town over and load up with sugar, fat and dairy be before we set off for hours of driving practice.
As a high schooler, my absolute favorite thing to get at a donut shop was a maple long john (or two) and a jug of full fat chocolate milk. Oh glory. I know,the two worst things I could possibly pick for myself nutritionally speaking. But, I was 15 years old, rail thin and going to school in the SUMMER to learn how to drive. CUT ME SOME SLACK.

The moral of the story: My love for neither maple long johns nor super thick chocolate milk has faded. But what has changed is my body’s apparent inability to process dairy anymore. So, while I can still indulge in a donut every once in a while, the milk thing has got to change.
Enter: Homemade Super Thick Chocolate Almond Milk. It’s dairy free and soooooo delicious!
This milk is simple to make, requiring just 3 ingredients and supplies you likely have on hand. Ingredients are:
Almonds
Filtered water
Dairy-free dark chocolate
Equipment includes a decent-quality blender and a very thin towel, cheesecloth or nut milk bag. You can try with a fine mesh strainer but I didn’t have much luck (too pulpy and I’m not much for pulp in my milk).
The best part is, you can make this in one afternoon if you’re in a hurry.Thanks to the genius of Kathy, we now know you can actually soak your almonds in boiling water, which makes them ready to blend into milk in about an hour!
But, for those of us who aren’t in a time crunch, overnight soaking is the way to go. The almonds are able to take their time and soak to get all plump and doubled in size for blending.
This almond milk is just what I was hoping for:
Thick
Creamy
Not too sweet
Super chocolaty
&amp; Totally delicious with a donut (or anything)
I hope enjoy this milk! I’ve nearly finished mine off and am already dreaming up other variations. Votes on flavor ideas are welcome below.

","Soak your almonds in warm water overnight at room temperature. Cover with enough water to ensure they're fully immersed plus 1 inch of water. No need to cover. If you're in a hurry, use boiling water - should reduce soaking time to 1 hour.The next day, drain and rinse your almonds under cool running water.Add almonds to a blender with filtered water (the more water, the thinner it will be) and cover tightly with lid and a towel just in case any liquid seeps through.Blend on high for 1 minute or until the milk looks creamy and only small bits of almonds are visible.To strain the almond milk you can either use a nut milk bag, cheesecloth or my favorite: a super thin clean dish towel. Simply lay the towel over a mixing bowl and pour on almond milk, then gather the corners of the towel, lift and gently squeeze the liquid into the bowl until only the pulp remains. See this recipe for more visual help.Once the milk is thoroughly strained, you can either keep the pulp to add to baked goods (such as muffins, quick breads, granolas) or discard it. Your choice.To a separate small bowl, add your chocolate and melt in 30 second increments in the microwave, or over a double boiler (a large bowl over a saucepan with an inch of simmering water).Once melted, spoon 1/3 cup of almond milk into the bowl and whisk to combine (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You're wanting a chocolate ""sauce"" so it will more easily mix with the milk.Once combined, add to the almond milk and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust flavor. You could add more melted chocolate using the same method, or even another sweetener of choice or cocoa powder for a more well-rounded chocolate flavor.Transfer to a container with a lid and store in the fridge for several days. Shake before serving. You could also freeze this for longer-term storage."
728,Raspberry Bourbon Smash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Winter Bourbon Smash

Friends! 2013 is almost over. Do you have New Year’s plans yet? Whether you’re going out or staying in, we have the perfect simple drink for you: A winter bourbon smash.

This drink has quite the history. We especially loved this excerpt:
“The smash is an open-ended cocktail, freely variable and seasonally flexible. There must be ice…There should be fruit in season, though you may use it simply as a garnish. There should be a spirit base…You may want to water your smash down a little or add a spritz of seltzer. At its heart, the smash is a wonderfully forgiving and flexible drink, made for…using what’s on hand and for smashing it all together over ice for pure sipping bliss.”
Now that we’re all learned on this beautiful, simple cocktail, let’s get to mixin’.

It all starts with raspberry jam. We called this a winter smash since traditionally a smash should contain a seasonal fruit. Being that it’s frigid outside and fresh fruit isn’t exactly plentiful, a jam is the perfect solution.
For flavor we went with raspberry, but you could really use any jam or preserve you have on hand. A perfect pairing to raspberry is orange, which we used as both a garnish and juice to add a brightness to this cocktail.



Two things I love about this drink:
1) It has a quenchable thickness thanks to the preserves.
2) It highlights the bourbon beautifully.
I wouldn’t consider myself a huge bourbon fan (unless it’s in caramel). But the more I try it in drinks like this, the more I love it. It has less of a punch than vodka and tequila and a distinct flavor that’s absolutely delicious when well mixed.

This drink is my new favorite. It’s:
Fruity
Not too sweet
Slightly creamy
Bright with citrus
Not too strong
&amp; So easy to make.
Make it this New Year’s Eve to bring in 2014 right. This is definitely what we’ll be cheersing to at midnight. Enjoy!


","Add ice, preserves, bourbon, triple sec and orange juice to a shaker and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.Pour into serving glass with a few ice cubes and top with a splash of club soda. Garnish with orange slices and enjoy. Repeat for more drinks."
729,St. Germain Spritzers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"St. Germain Pomegranate Spritzers

Besides my birthday, Christmas is the climax of my year.
I wait in heavy anticipation for 12 months for the day that arrives in what seems like a flash and before I know it, it’s over. And all the excitement surrounding it evaporates in seconds. There’s nothing quite like the holiday season and I hate knowing I won’t taste it again until next year.
Thus, it’s a given that New Year’s takes a back seat to my joyous, beloved Christmas. Part of the reason? There are few traditions surrounding New Year’s, including zero presents and very few cookies (BOO). But, I’ve recognized lately that big changes and even life-altering discussions have surrounded our past several New Year’s celebrations, and it’s caused me to reconsider my affection for it. It’s no Christmas but it causes me to reflect on a year gone by and what lies ahead. And that calls for celebrating.
Libations anyone?

During our recent tour de Europe, we found ourselves in Barcelona at perhaps my favorite coffee shop in the world – Caravelle. A recommendation of the Oh, Ladycakes herself, we were immediately drawn to the coffee and food Caravelle had to offer. But I couldn’t help but wonder what their drink special was all about: a St. Germain Spritzer?
I’d never even heard of St. Germain before, but it intrigued me. So we did a little research and discovered it’s of French origin and derived from elderberry flowers. An artisanal liqueur, St. Germain has a delicate, floral flavor that mixes incredibly well with champagne, club soda and citrus.

We ended up ordering the special, then another, then we convinced our friends to order one, too. Practically the minute we got back home we went searching for a bottle of St. Germain and have since been experimenting with (and thoroughly enjoying) this incredibly unique and delicious liqueur.

It turns out, St. Germain, sparkling white wine and pomegranate juice are meant to be together. This spritzer is comprised of a Brut sparkling white wine, a shot of St. Germain, pomegranate juice and arils and a dash of club soda. So simple, so delicious.

We fell in love with this cocktail and found it perfect for special celebrations, especially New Year’s Eve.It’s:
Light
Fruity
Floral
Bubbly
Not too sweet
&amp; Highly customizable.
When you have bubbly and St. Germain in a glass, it’s really hard to go wrong. Cheers, friends!

P.S. What are you doing for New Year’s?We’re either going to a party with people we don’t know who apparently just bought two cats (John and I are both allergic), or doing absolutely nothing. Either way it’s a win-win.
Happy (early) New Year!

730,Vegan Detox Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Detox Smoothie

I’m guessing right about now you’re having some serious cookie regret. I only say that because that’s usually where I’m at Christmas week. So much indulgence, so many stretchy pants.
How about we offset some of that decadence with a healthy, 5 ingredient superfood smoothie? That’s what I thought we could all use…

This smoothie starts with a base of frozen berries. I can’t bear going without berries all winter long, so snagging frozen ones at the store is the perfect solution. Plus, they make a healthy and delicious base for smoothies.

Next we add in:
Spinach
Flaxseed
Fruit juice
&amp; A frozen banana
So creamy. So delicious.

Recently, I’ve also been digging silken tofu in my smoothies for added protein instead of almond or peanut butter, which I often do in this smoothie. But I count it as optional since it’s already seriously creamy and nutritious as is.

Oh mama. So much detoxifying goodness in the form of:
Fiber
Antioxidants
Omega 3 fatty acids
Vitamin C
Folic acid
Phytonutrients
etc., etc.
Does the body (seriously) good. Cheers!
(P.S. You should totally tell me the best gift you got this Christmas. I seriously want to know.)

","Add all ingredients to a blender and blend on high until smooth. If too thick, add a splash more juice or water. For more sweetness, add extra frozen banana.Pour into two serving glasses (as original recipe is written) and enjoy."
731,Vegan Cinnamon Roll Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cinnamon Roll Pancakes


I had a bit of a debacle as to what to post Christmas week since everyone is so busy running around, wrapping gifts, traveling to see family and likely already have their holiday menus all planned out. But, I figured everybody surelyhas room for one more breakfast recipe in their back pocket with a week of lazy mornings surely on the horizon. Am I right?

For me, it was clearly between pancakes or cinnamon rolls. So, I put it to vote with aquestionon Instagram and got a TON of responses. You guys are seriously awesome. One, because you care about what we post. And two, because you inspired me to dream up an entirely new recipe I hadn’t even thought of yet.
About half way through the comments somebody suggested cinnamon roll pancakes and it’s like they read my mind! I was thinking the exact same thing in that very moment. The perfect marriage of two perfect breakfast foods. It was on.
(P.S. for those who voted cinnamon rolls, don’t worry! I’m already plotting two recipes that I think you’ll be quite pleased with so sit tight and eat pancakes in the meantime.)

I have never attempted cinnamon roll pancakes but I know they’ve been done before by a lot of bloggers, so I wanted to do something different and if possible, vegan. Turns out, both were entirely possible.
To get that quintessential cinnamon roll flavor I started with a yeasted, whole grain batter since nearly all cinnamon rolls have that amazing earthy, bakers-essential yeast flavor. I was so stoked to see that it rose to double in size just like I was hoping with all of its bubbly, yeasty goodness. Then, I scooped out a bit of the batter, added in brown sugar, cinnamon and a little melted butter and I had my cinnamon swirl in hand.

So easy and so delicious! Look how fluffy and decadent they look cooking up.


These cinnamon roll pancakes are legit and only require 8 ingredients!
Almond milk
Vegan butter
Whole-wheat pastry flour
Cinnamon
Sugar &amp; brown sugar
Salt
Yeast
That’s it! You likely already have all those things on hand. Plus, they produce a surprisingly small mess of dishes and come together start to finish in under 2 hours. Not bad for pancakes that cram all of the flavor of homemade, slow-prepared cinnamon rolls into every fluffy bite.

While I don’t think a glaze is necessary, I couldn’t bare trying them without one. I went with my favorite easy glaze that always yields plenty of leftovers: Powdered sugar, almond milk and melted vegan butter (recipe below). So good once it hits your lips.

These pancakes really do taste like cinnamon rolls!
Fluffy
Not too sweet
Packed with cinnamon, brown sugar flavor
Seriously filling
&amp; Surprisingly healthy
Plus, they feed a crowd and can be easily doubled and tripled, with one batch making at least 8 large pancakes. (Two should be plenty for one person.)

Make these for your family and friends this week! I think they’ll love them. Plus, I have a feeling they’ll make your holiday gatherings a little bit sweeter and more memorable. Enjoy!




","Batter: In a large mixing bowl in the microwave heat the almond milk and vegan butter in 30 second increments, until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Alternatively, heat the ingredients in a saucepan over medium-low heat.Let mixture cool to 110 degrees F (43 C), or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.Sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add sugar and the salt and stir.Next add in flour 1/4 cup at a time, stirring as you go. If there's a lot of lumps, use a whisk but so do gently and not vigorously. The batter will become sticky but it shouldn't be like a dough. 1 1/2 cups should be the ideal amount (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), but add more if it appears too runny. It will resemble normal pancake batter. Thick but pourable.Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for at least 1 hour if not 2, or until doubled in size. The batter will proof more quickly if you use rapid rise, but active dry works well too. It just takes a bit longer.Cinnamon Swirl: Once risen, gently scoop out 2 1/2 Tbsp of your batter and add 1 Tbsp melted vegan butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 3 Tbsp brown sugar (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Thin it with almond milk if it's too thick to pour. Whisk until well combined and add to a sandwich bag (which you'll snip the corner off of) or a plastic squeeze bottle.Preheat a griddle or large skillet to medium heat and lightly grease surface. Scoop on 1/4 cup measurements of batter and then swirl on the cinnamon sugar filling in a circle starting at the center and traveling out. It doesn't have to be perfect - you could even make other shapes/designs.Flip when bubbles form on top and the edges appear dry. Cook for 1-2 minutes more and transfer to a large plate or serving dish. Keep warm in a 200 degree oven until serving.Optional but recommended: Frost with dairy-free cream cheese frosting or a mixture of 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp melted vegan butter and 1-2 Tbsp almond milk (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). I prefer a thicker glaze but make it as thin as you prefer. Or just top with maple syrup.Store leftovers covered in the fridge for up to a few days. Move to the freezer in a freezer safe bag or container for longer term storage. These should reheat well in the microwave or toaster."
732,Vegan Peppermint Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peppermint Black Bean Brownies

Happy (almost) Christmas week! I feel we’ve nearly reached the pinnacle of holiday spirit. For me, it peaks around the 20th and by Christmas Eve I’ve calmed back down to normal person emotions. But until then, I will buy gifts and wrap presents and bake Christmas-y treats like these 1-bowl fudgy peppermint brownies like a mad woman. They’re so good you’d never guess they were vegan, gluten-free, and loaded with good-for-you nutrients. Yipeee!

The batter is so simple. It all happens in ONE BOWL – your food processor! This ensures the the black beans are completely pulverized and undetectable in the finished product.

Look at that fudgy goodness. It’s honestly so good you could just eat it straight, which I have a number of times. Because there’s no eggs, no regret. It’s science.


Baking these guys in a muffin tin allows every brownie to achieve that perfect, slightly-firm edge and ooey-gooey center. But, I’ve had plenty of people bake these in pans with similar success. So really, it’s your call! I just prefer the bites because I like miniature things. There, I said it.

These brownies get their peppermint two ways:
1) Peppermint extract inside the brownies, and
2) A dusting of crushed candy canes on top.
Chocolate and mint are kind of meant to be together, and these brownies only solidify that fact.

These really are the perfect, healthier GF and V dessert for all your holiday gatherings this coming week (and even New Year’s parties!). They are super moist and fudgy in the center, firm but not too crisp on the edges, and loaded with intense chocolate flavor from both cocoa powder and chocolate chips.


You and your friends will LOVE these brownies. Trust me. I took these down to the staff in our new apartment building and I believe the phrase “inhaled them” was the word most used when I returned later to drop off more treats. Total win (and no black beans detected). Score and score.

And if you happen to have some on hand, coconut whipped cream makes thee BEST frosting for these little guys! Enjoy!


","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly grease a 12-slot standard size muffin pan (not mini // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Prepare flax egg by combining flax and water in the bowl of the food processor. Pulse a couple times and then let rest for a few minutes.Add remaining ingredients besides candy canes, peppermint extract and chocolate chips, and puree – about 3 minutes – scraping down sides as needed. You want it pretty smooth.If the batter appears too thick, add 1-2 Tbsp water or almond milk and pulse again. It should be slightly less thick than chocolate frosting but nowhere close to runny.Add in peppermint extract a little at a time, pulse, sample and adjust until it's to your liking. I liked 1/4 tsp (as original recipe is written). Then stir in chocolate chips.Evenly distribute the batter into the muffin tin and smooth the tops with a spoon or your finger.Bake for 21-26 minutes or until the tops are dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides. I found mine took about 25.Remove from oven and let cool for 20-30 minutes before removing from pan. They will be tender, so remove gently with a butter knife or fork. The insides are meant to be very fudgy, so don’t be concerned if they seem too moist – that’s the point. Plus, they’re vegan so it doesn’t really matter anyway.Dust with crushed candy cane and serve immediately. Topping them with coconut whipped cream makes them ultra decadent and pairs perfectly with the chocolate-mint flavor.Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. Refrigerate to keep longer."
733,Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Men | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Men

I put out a little “SOS” of sorts on Facebook last week asking you guys what type of baked treats you’d like to see on the blog before Christmas. Though I got a lot of replies the most common theme was gingerbread, and specifically to make it gluten-free and vegan. When you talk, I listen! I got to work that same day and perfected a recipe by morning. Friends, I present to you both gluten-free AND vegan gingerbread men!


This batter is seriously decadent looking, no? But it’s deceptive as it actually has plenty of wholesome gluten-free grains like buckwheat, brown rice, and oat flour. It also includes one flax egg and a healthy heaping of molasses, which we all know is good for the soul. A few other basic ingredients and we have 1-bowl magic on our hands. Next? Chill, roll, and stamp – my favorite part.


These little guys take a little tender care in the stamping process but once you get them on the tray you’re home free. And the good news is, if you’d rather not mess with cutting them into shapes, you can just roll them into little balls and bake them into some of the BEST, crispy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-insider ginger cookies I’ve ever had. No joke!


Look at that stack of gingerbread goodness. These guys are:
Crispy on the edges
Tender and slightly chewy in the center
Packed with ginger, cinnamon and molasses flavor
Seriously addictive
&amp; Begging to be frosted.
I can fix that…


For my frosting I went with a simple mix of powdered sugar, melted vegan butter, and a dash of almond milk. This is the perfect and most simple frosting for these little dudes.
OK, I lied. Stamping them out is my SECOND favorite step. Icing them is my first.


I hope you enjoy these cookies! Make them for friends, for yourself, or with the little kiddos in your life. They will have a ball dotting on buttons and faces and tiny gingerbread man shoes. Maybe more fun than you (but I doubt it).


Once they’re all dressed, package them up and send them to far away friends or ones just across the street. These would also be adorable individually wrapped in cellophane and tied onto presents. Just sayin’. Your family would be seriously impressed.

And before I go, can I just say that making them into little rounds is my preferred way to go because although they aren’t as adorable, they taste like gingerbread MAGIC IN THE MOUTH. Get you some. Happy holidays, friends!

","In a large mixing bowl, prepare flax egg by mixing flax and water and letting rest for 5 minutes.Add softened butter, molasses, almond butter, brown sugar, salt, spices, baking soda and beat on low with a mixer, or vigorously whisk.Add gluten free flour to the wet ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon. Stir until well combined. Your dough should hold its shape when pressed, but not feel dry. I found that 1.5 cups (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) was about the perfect amount, but this will depend on your blend.Cover and chill dough for at least one hour (preferably overnight).Once chilled, preheat oven to 350 degrees (176 C). Carefully roll out dough to a little thicker than 1/8 inch between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment/wax paper, generously sprinkling the bottom layer and the top of the dough with white or brown rice flour before rolling. You don't want it too thin or they'll be too crisp.Remove top sheet and, working quickly, dip your cookie cutters in rice flour and cut out shapes. Next, lift the plastic wrap (with all of the dough) and place it on a baking sheet or large plate and freeze for 5 minutes to let them firm up. This will make them easier to transfer to your baking sheet for baking.Next, use a lightly floured spatula to carefully transfer the cookies to a baking sheet, working quickly. Leave 2 inches for spreading.Bake for 8-10 minutes or until they appear only slightly browned on the edges. They'll continue firming up as they sit on the pan. Let rest on the pan for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.Once cooled, decorate with frosting or sprinkle with powdered sugar. I think a perfect, simple frosting option is piping on a mix of 2 cups icing sugar, 1 Tbsp melted butter, and 1-2 Tbsp almond milk (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Just make sure it's on the thicker side so it doesn't run.Store covered at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer term storage. The batch should make between 25-35 cookies, depending on the size of your cookie cutter / or if you decide not to cut them and roll them into balls."
734,Vegan Frosting Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Coconut Macadamia Frosting

A dozen or so days out of the year I find it completely acceptable to slather buttercream frosting on anything and everything in sight and go to party town. Birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, promotions, finding a really good sale at Target. Go ahead, girl. Celebrate. But then for the other five353 days out of the year we need something a little lighter, right? A little, less-than-1,000-fat-grams-per-serving. I’m not saying frosting is bad. In fact, if you say that, I say shun you, non believer. I’m just saying, we could use a healthier one in our arsenal once in a while for when the healthy mood strikes us. And for those times, I have just the solution.


Guess what?! Shredded coconut and macadamia nuts whirled together make frosting! A creamy, coconut-y, vanilla frosting that goes perfect on sugar cookies, pancakes, waffles, angel food cake and anything else for that matter.And there’s no butter and very little sugar involved.


The buttery, creamy goodness of macadamia nuts + the rich flavor of coconut is kind of perfect in this frosting.
If you are a coconut fan you will LOVE this recipe. I colored mine for frosting sugar cookies with, but you could just as easily leave it plain and dress it up with colored sprinkles or sugar.

The important part: What’s it taste like?
Buttery
Not too sweet
Infused with vanilla
Smooth with just a little texture from the coconut flake
&amp; Perfect for piping!
Plus, with only 4 ingredients and a virtually endless shelf life, it’s the perfect “frosting” to have on hand for both special and everyday use. Enjoy!



","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and place macadamia nuts on a baking sheet.Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the macadamias have a bit of golden color and become fragrant. Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes.Add nuts to a food processor and blend into a meal. Remove and set aside.Add coconut flake to the processor and blend until creamy and smooth. This will take anywhere from 5-10 minutes depending on the strength/blade of your food processor. Scrape down sides as needed.As soon as you have your coconut butter, add macadamia nut meal and vanilla and blend again until smooth.Add powdered sugar 1 Tbsp at a time until you reach desired sweetness. I found that 5-6 was perfect for me, plus helped it thicken up a bit (amount as original recipe is written).At this point it's perfect for adding to a squeeze bottle or piping bag and piping onto your baked good. Otherwise, you can refrigerate it to make it thicker. Will keep stored in the refrigerator for up to a month. Recipe (as originally written) makes enough to frost at least 3-4 dozen cookies + leftovers."
735,Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Soft Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies

There are two foods I can eat to no virtually no end: anything dark chocolate and peanut butter,and sugar cookies. Not just any sugar cookies; my aunt Patti’s famous, soft sugar cookies that she’s brought to Christmas every year for as long as I remember. Sometime around November I go ahead and resolve that I’m going to fall off the wagon on these cookies. But because I only fall off the food wagon a few 10 times a year, I figure it’s totally worth it. After all, they’re sugar cookies! I mean, c’mon. Live a little.

Here’s the thing about sugar cookies. They contain lots and lots of butter, sugar and gluten, the last one being a major offender for a growing number of people. But I say you can still have cookies, you just have to get creative and replace the gluten with something else, like a baking blend? Yes, like a gluten-free baking blend. Exactly.

After trying my baking blend/pancake mix in GF chocolate chip cookies and having such wild success, I knew sugar cookies were my next target. And I’m happy to report that it totally worked! Again!
This mix produced some of the softest, fluffiest, most flavorful sugar cookies I’ve ever had – no joke! Who says you need gluten after all…?


These cookies are little pillows of Christmas-y goodness.
Tender
Sweet
Fluffy + soft
Infused with vanilla
Perfect on their own
Or topped with sprinkles.
&amp; Not at all grainy or tough.
Anyway you put it, these guys are a total dream! Make them for your family and friends this holiday season. I bet you so much cheddar bank that they won’t be able to tell they’re gluten free – not one bit. Enjoy!


P.S. Stick around till Tuesday for a healthier4-ingredient frosting recipe that goes perfectly with these cookies. In the meantime, gobble them up as is. They’re seriously that good.

NOTE: Recipe updated on January 8, 2016 to remove the mentionof using other gluten free bakingmixes in place of my gluten-free baking mix. I haven’t tested these cookies with any other gluten-free mix than my Gluten-Free Pancake/Baking Mix. Be sure to use that blend in this recipe, otherwise I can’t guarantee the results.
","In a large mixing bowl, beat together softened butter and sugar until creamy. Add egg and vanilla and mix again until well combined, scraping sides of bowl as needed.Next, alternate adding baking mix and milk until a thick dough forms. Depending on the flour blend/baking mix you use, this will take anywhere between 2.75 - 3.25 cups (as original recipe is written). I found that 3 was about the right amount. Cover and refrigerate at least 2-3 hours, preferably overnight.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Scoop rounded 1 Tbsp amounts of dough and gently roll/form into balls. Place 2 inches apart on pan to allow for spreading.Bake for 10-12 minutes or until slightly golden brown around the edges and no longer wet. They should be pretty puffy but not have a lot of color. Otherwise they'll become too dry.Let set on pan for a few minutes, then use a spatula to transfer to a cooling rack. I topped mine with a few sprinkles, but these would also be excellent with a simple frosting of 2 cups powdered sugar + 1 Tbsp melted butter + 1-2 Tbsp milk OR my simple 4 ingredient macadamia coconut frosting. Store covered in an airtight container for several days. Freeze for longer term storage. Makes between 36-42 cookies (as original recipe is written)."
736,Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Soft &amp; Chewy Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies

I am currently in love with two things:1) our new Canon 5D Mark III and the way a 50mm lens + an extension tube totally kills food photography, and 2) THESE FRIGGIN’ COOKIES.

Speaking of these friggin’ cookies, they’re gluten-free thanks to this (amazing, versatile, whole grain) baking mix. (Yes, the one I made pancakes with.) And they are SO delicious and soft and addictive that you’d NEVER guess in a million years they were gluten-free. Hooray!


When I had such great success with the gluten-free mix for pancakes, I immediately wondered if it would work in cookies. Well, it turns out IT DOES – really, really well.
Including the mix these cookies require just 7 ingredients and 1 bowl. That’s simple baking at its finest.


So what do these guys taste like?
Tender
Slightly crisp on the edges
Not greasy at all
Perfectly sweet
Balanced with a bit of sea salt
Seriously chocolaty
&amp; Kind of (totally) perfect.

As I ate three more cookies after my initial “test bite,” I couldn’t help but think:
A) They in NO way taste gluten-free; and
B) How they reminded me of the Keebler Soft Batch cookies I used to murder when I was a kid.
Seriously, they’re THAT DELICIOUS. You have to make these cookies! Cheers.

737,Gluten-Free Pancake Mix | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Pancake Mix

Pancakes have always been one of my favorite foods. There’s something about a fluffy stack of pancakes covered in butter and syrup that makes getting up just a little bit easier.
And though my preferences for pancakes have evolved over the years to include much healthier versions, I can always go back to enjoy a classic stack with no mix-ins or crazy flavors.
Though John and I are not required to eat gluten-free, a number of our friends are, which has not only caused us to be more considerate of their needs but also more aware of how gluten sneaks its way into so many of the foods we enjoy – including pancakes.

I was inspired to create a gluten-free pancake mix not only for gluten-free eaters, but also for those who hope to experiment with gluten-free eating or are just looking for a more wholesome, homemade everyday pancake mix.
Though I’m not a gluten-free cooking expert (yet), I do know one thing about baking gluten-free: mixing/blending flours is a must. It provides diversity and complexity, which (hopefully) provides the final product with a density and texture that is similar to that of gluten-containing goods.
For this reason I went with a wholesome mix of brown and white rice flours, buckwheat flour, GF oat flour, cornmeal, and a pinch of xanthan gum for binding.The rest is pretty basic stuff: sugar, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.



You guys, the result was amazing and exactly the GF mix I was hoping for.
Just add roughly:
1 1/2 cups milk or buttermilk
1 egg
1 Tbsp melted butter or oil
And voila! You have some seriously fluffy, delicious (and hearty) pancakes on your hands.

What do they taste like? Fluffy, not too sweet and perfect under a drizzle of melted butter and honey or syrup.
John and I both agreed that you wouldn’t be able to guess they were gluten-free if you didn’t know otherwise. That counts as a massive success in my book. Make this for yourself for quick, weekday breakfasts, or as a Christmas gift for gluten-free eaters in your life. They’ll love you forever – promise.
This recipe is also customizable! Add any spices you prefer to the mix, such as cinnamon, cardamom, or nutmeg. And if you can’t get your hands on any of the flours I list, play around with the other GF flours to compensate. It should be fairly forgiving. As well, boost their flavor by adding mashed banana, blueberries, peanut butter or chocolate chips to the batter before cooking. And lastly, don’t forget the butter and syrup (or honey, as I prefer). Enjoy!

NOTE: Recipe updated January 8, 2016 to include: Added note about raw buckwheat flour, not toasted buckwheat flour. I buy raw buckwheat groats from the store and grind them into flour!
","Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and whisk until well combined. You could also sift the mixture if you have one on hand, but do so several times to ensure it's thoroughly mixed.To make pancakes (according to the amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), whisk 1 large egg, 1 cup of buttermilk or milk, and 1 Tbsp melted butter or coconut oil. Then add in 1 cup of mix. If your batter appears too thick (it should stream out of a measuring cup, not glop), add more buttermilk.Let batter rest for 5-10 minutes and preheat griddle to medium heat. Lightly grease surface and add 1/4 cup measurements of the batter. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until bubbles form on top and the edges appear dry, checking around the 2 minute mark to ensure they aren't too brown. Adjust heat as needed.Cook for 1-3 minutes more or until the other side is brown and the pancake feels firm when lightly pressed with a spatula. One batch should yield about 10 pancakes.Serve with butter and honey or syrup. Store leftovers in the freezer. To reheat, simply thaw for 30 seconds in the microwave and then toast in a toaster until warmed through."
738,Vegan Peppermint Drinking Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peppermint Drinking Chocolate

Oh hey! It’s Christmastime – my absolute favorite time of year. Why? For one, I get to make and eat tons of goodies this month, like chocolate and peppermint things! Swoon.


My first peppermint-chocolate creation was inspired by our time in Zurich, Switzerland last fall, where chocolate is one of their prized specialties. People form lines around chocolate shops there and it’s all because it’s made fresh daily by artisans who have made chocolate their life and craft. It’s no joking around.
Besides eating truffles and bars, another very Swiss way to consume chocolate is by drinking it. I can totally get on board with this concept.

Drinking chocolate differs from hot cocoa in that it’s much thicker and usually contains melted chocolate rather than cocoa powder. This makes it richer, creamier and all-the-more decadent.
It’s normally treated as more of an indulgent dessert than a daily drink, though I wouldn’t judge if you opted for the latter.

For this recipe you need:
Coconut milk
Dark chocolate
Peppermint extract
Raw/Turbinado sugar
Coconut whipped creamisn’t necessary but highly, highly recommended. I mean, come on. You’re already going to party town. Why not go all the way? A little sprinkle of crushed peppermint doesn’t hurt, either…

This drinking chocolate is my new obsession! It is thick, slightly coconutty, insanely creamy, intensely chocolaty, and balanced with a hint of peppermint.
This recipe makes a descent sized batch, which you could serve to a small group. Since I apparently don’t have friends or I don’t like to share, I’ve hoarded mine all to myself and have been reheating little portions after dinner for a little virgin nightcap. But I can almost guarantee that Baileys or Kahlua would be delightful in this drink.
For more festive boozy libations, check out our Frozen Blended White Russian and Boozy Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate.

Enjoy!

","Add milk to a small saucepan over medium-low heat and stir occasionally until warm - about 5 minutes. You don't want it to boil, just get hot enough to melt the chocolate.Once hot, add the chocolate and sugar and whisk to melt. Do so vigorously to ensure everything gets combined. Once it has reached your desired temperature, sample a bit to determine if it's sweet enough for your liking. I added another 1 1/2 tsp sugar at this point (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Remove from heat and add peppermint extract, starting with only lesser end of range (1/8 tsp as original recipe is written) since it can be very strong and overpowering. Once it's to your liking, transfer to small serving glasses and top with a dollop of coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed peppermint candies/candy canes. I poured mine into two glasses but it was honestly too decadent to finish. I'd recommend splitting this (as original recipe is written) between 3-4 servings.Store leftovers covered in the fridge for several days. Move to the freezer for longer-term storage."
739,Vegan Peanut Butter & Jelly Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"PB&amp;J Graham Cracker Thumbprints

Ahhh! It’s officially Christmas cookie season and I couldn’t be more thrilled. Consider this my first of many efforts to make your holiday season a little bit more simple and delicious. The great news? This just happens to be a 1-bowl, 7-ingredient, 30-minute recipe! I love (baking) simplicity.


The ingredients list for these cookies is simple:
Peanut Butter
Graham crackers
Flaxseed
Brown Sugar
Unbleached flour
Vegan butter
Jam
That’s it! I canalmostbet you have all of these items on hand. I love it when that happens.


In addition to the ingredients being minimal, the process is about as simple as it gets. Simply mix your wet ingredients in one bowl, add in your dry, mix and you’re good to go! Just roll those babies out and them give them a thumbprint. Playing with your food = so much fun.



After a short 10 minutes in the oven simply top them with warmed jam and they’re ready to eat. I sprinkled mine with a bit more graham cracker crumbs and thought it the perfect finish to a perfect peanut butter cookie.


The important stuff: What do they taste like? Kind of incredible.
A little crisp on the outside
Oh-so tender on the inside
Packed with PB flavor
Not-too sweet
&amp; The perfect combination of flavors.
I mean, peanut butter, jelly and graham crackers are kind of meant to be together.

Even better news? They travel well and somehow get better the second day! I love it when that happens.
They’re also fairly customizable. If you aren’t a peanut butter fan, sub almond butter. And if you don’t like jam (who are you?), sub Nutella, a mini PB cub or a square of dark chocolate! Dream big and eat (cookies) often this December. Happy baking, friends!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C)Prepare flax egg. Set aside.Beat peanut butter and butter together until light and fluffy. Add flax egg, brown sugar and stir.Add graham crumbs and stir to combine. Then add in flour a little bit at a time until a firm dough forms - you don't want it to be crumbly. It should take about 1/2 cup (as original recipe is written).Scoop out 1 packed Tbsp worth of dough and gently form/roll into balls. Moisten your hands with olive or canola oil if they aren't molding easily. Place on lightly greased baking sheet.Flatten balls gently with the bottom of a glass and use your thumb or finger to make an indention.Bake for 8 minutes and remove from oven. The indentions should've puffed up, so press them back down a little and pop them back in the oven to brown up a little more - 2-3 minutes until slightly golden brown. Be careful not to over-bake or they'll be too crunchy.Let rest on pans for a few minutes then transfer to cool on wire racks. Once the cookies are cooled, heat your jam until warm and pourable in a saucepan over medium-low heat or in the microwave. Then spoon small amounts (~1 tsp) of your jam into the middle of each cookie. Sprinkle with a few more graham cracker crumbs and serve immediately.Let cool completely before covering. To store, cover and keep at room temperature for up to 2-3 days."

Happy December! Are you ready for all that my favorite month brings? I am. Currently my Indie Holidays Pandora station is creating quite a festive ambience as I sip coffee and write this post for some seriously delicious gluten free quick bread.

Since becoming friends with several gluten free eaters it’s been a personal challenge of mine to create gluten free recipes that are just as delicious as non-gluten free ones. And I’m happy to report that this simple, ONE BOWL banana bread is one of them. Hoo-ray!

The ingredients in this loaf are simple:
Ripe bananas &amp; butternut squash

It’s moist, tender and hearty
Full of sweet banana flavor
with a hint of buttery winter squash
Nutty and wholesome thanks to almonds + oats
Perfectly sweet
&amp; Absolutely perfect with a smear of butter and honey
Oh my.

This bread is absolutely perfect for serving to a crowd.
Book club? Yes.
Friend gathering? Yes.
Holiday party? Heck yes.
Christmas pre-game? Why not?
You get the point. This recipe is really ideal in any setting, even to bake on Sunday and have for breakfast or snacks throughout the week. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and grease or spray a standard 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray, or line with parchment paper (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size).Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth and creamy.

741,Butternut Squash Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butternut Squash Potato Salad

Hi, my name’s Dana and I’m a butternut squash addict?
I admitted my new obsession with this gorgeous winter fruit in last week’s post for Warm Butternut Squash Salad. Well I couldn’t keep my paws off of it once I discovered how versatile and truly quick and easy it is to prepare. Once you shimmy the skin off it’s literally 15 minutes in the oven ’til go time. That’s my kind of meal.

I find the texture of squash to work well in salads because it gets kind of tender yet holds its form when tossed. And because I have loved potato salad since I was a fat baby on my mom’s knee I knew I had to try butternut squash version to add to my Thanksgiving table. Dressed with a light and creamy yogurt-based dressing, it was everything I had hoped for: Light, crunchy, and filling with a delicate balance of sweet and savory flavors.

The ingredients of this salad are simple:
Red skin potatoes
Butternut squash
Radishes
&amp; Green onion
And with a simple dressing of Greek yogurt and mayo (or vegan alternatives), grainy mustard, vinegar, and standard spices, it’s the simplest of side dishes to prepare.

Hands on prep time is less than 30 minutes and the whole thing comes together in about 1 hour. Plus, it’s a one bowl operation. Mix up the dressing, dump in the rest and toss! Easy and SO flavorful and satisfying.
The crunch factor is perfect with the radishes and green onion. And the potato and squash remain tender and complement each other well married under the creamy dressing.

Make this recipe for Thanksgiving, Christmas and beyond. It’s such a versatile dish that travels well and requires little prep time. Plus, as ingredients come in and out of season you can sub them in place of each other and make something entirely new. You could even add a little protein of your choice to make this a complete meal: chickpeas, chicken, hard boiled eggs? Whatever you prefer. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the center of the oven.Rinse and scrub your potatoes and place them in a large saucepan or pot. Top with cold water until just covered then place on high heat until boiling. Reduce heat slightly and cook until tender. Stick a knife in the center of a potato – it should slide off easily when done. Once fully cooked, drain and set aside to cool. Then quarter.While potatoes are cooking, prepare your squash. Toss butternut squash cubes in 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp each sea salt and pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until just tender. You don’t want it to get mushy, just soft.While cooking, prepare your dressing in your serving bowl. Add Greek yogurt, mayo, vinegar, mustard, coriander and a healthy pinch each of salt and pepper. Whisk and taste – adjust seasonings as desired. Add more vinegar or water to thin out.Add squash, quartered potatoes, radishes and green onion to the bowl and toss. Sample and adjust seasonings as needed. Serve immediately. Cover and refrigerate leftovers – should keep for several days, though best when fresh."
742,Apple Cinnamon Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Apple Cinnamon Waffles

If you love warm, baked cinnamon apples and maple syrup-doused waffles, this is the recipe for you. If you don’t like these things, in the words of Uncle Rico, you can leave.

Joking aside, these waffles are some of my faves. Warm, cinnamon-brown sugar apples mixed into a whole grain-oat waffle batter – it’s practically perfection. The good news? They’re super easy to make.


This is a 1-bowl recipe, which means fewer dishes! I love that. Plus, it comes together in about 30 minutes. It doesn’t get much better than that for some seriously sophisticated waffles.

The primary ingredients you’ll need for this recipe are:
Apples
Brown Sugar
Cinnamon
Flaxseed
Whole Wheat Flour
Oats
Applesauce or Pumpkin Puree
&amp; Maple Syrup
A few other pantry staples and you’re in business.

These waffles are so delicious I ate two right away! John can attest.
I love that they’re tender on the inside, yet a little crisp on the edges,
studded with warm cinnamon apples in every bite,
and perfect under a drizzle of maple syrup.

These are simple enough to make during the week before getting off to work and school, yet special enough to serve up for breakfast or brunch ona lazy Sunday morning. Versatile, simple and so delicious when frozen and re-heated in the toaster. That’s my kind of waffle. Enjoy!


","Start by sautéing your apples. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot add butter, then apples and stir. After a few minutes add in brown sugar and cinnamon. Cover to let steam and soften, stirring frequently. Once softened (about 4-5 minutes) remove lid to let caramelize a bit more. Remove from heat.Next, prepare your waffles. Start by preparing flax egg by combining water and flaxseed in a large bowl and letting rest for 5 minutes.Add maple syrup, applesauce, melted butter or oil, brown sugar and whisk. Add almond milk and stir once more.Add flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon to a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. Gently fold in oats, then half of the apples. If batter appears too thick, add a little almond milk. Let batter rest for 5 minutes while preheating waffle iron.Once preheated, generously spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and spoon about 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the iron, press down to spread the batter, and cook according to your machine’s instructions. I like to set mine to the darkest setting so it gets extra crispy.Once done, remove and place on cooling rack to let steam roll off and crisp up a bit. Serve warm with vegan butter (such as Earth Balance) and maple syrup, and the leftover apples. Store in an airtight container in the freezer and warm in the toaster or oven."
743,Roasted Butternut Squash Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Warm Roasted Butternut Squash Salad

For some reason I’ve never been a big squash person. In fact, the first time I even tried or touched a butternut squash was last fall when I showed up early for a party and my friend put me to work peeling and cubing one (which, by the way, is not an easy thing to do for a squash novice).
But this year I was determined to get into the kitchen and get familiar this gorgeous winter fruit. And I’m happy to report that I’ve created three amazing recipes, this colorful and simple salad being the first.

First you want to start by removing the skin and cubing your squash. If you have a heavy-duty peeler, use that. Otherwise, stick withthis method. It’s tricky at first since the skin is tough, but after my second try, I was nearly a pro.

To get the squash tender and flavorful, simply toss it in olive oil and a little salt and pepper and roast. Not for long either! It only takes about 15-20 minutes in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven.

The next element of this salad is pecans, which can easily be prepared while the squash is roasting. Simply toast raw pecans in a skillet, remove and add olive oil and brown sugar, and then add the pecans back in a toss! It’s the easiest and most fool-proof method to perfect toasty, caramelized pecans every time.
The only thing left to do after that is add in some spinach, cranberries and toss it all together with a little more olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper.
This salad is so simple and delicious, perfect for fall gatherings or even as a healthy and filling take-along lunch for work or school since it doesn’t need to be refrigerated. In fact, it’s best when served warm.
I suspect you’ll love the mix of textures and flavors here, especially how the balsamic adds a nice acidity to balance the sweetness. Enjoy!

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the center of the oven.Toss butternut squash cubes in 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp pepper (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Roast for 15-20 minutes or until just tender. You don’t want it to get mushy, just tender.While roasting, prepare your pecans by heating a medium skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add pecans and toss or stir until toasty and fragrant, being careful not to burn. Remove from skillet.To the same skillet add 1 Tbsp olive oil (or butter) and 2 Tbsp brown sugar and stir to combine (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then add pecans back in plus a pinch of salt and toss for a minute or two until fully coated and fragrant. Transfer to a plate to cool, spreading to make sure they don’t stick together.Chop or loosely tear your greens and add to a serving bowl along with the cranberries. Once butternut squash is done, toss it right into the bowl along with the pecans.Lastly, add remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar (optional // amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and toss. Add more salt or pepper if desired. Serve immediately. If not vegan, goat or Gorgonzola cheese would be a brilliant addition."
744,Caramelized Pear Steel-Cut Oats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Brown Sugar Pear Steel-Cut Oats

Pears are kind of gorgeous, no? They’re also delicious. In fact, they were the only fruit besides bananas that I would eat when I was a kid. Thankfully I’ve evolved since then to love almost every other fruit in existence. Fruit: It’s like nature’s candy.


While pears are delicious all on their own, they’re even better browned in a little butter and brown sugar. This makes them tender and gives them a nice sweet, caramelized flavor.

Then come the oats! So simple and hearty and delicious and absolutely perfect for cold temps. Personally, few things sound more satisfying to me than a warm bowl of steel cut oats on chilly fall or winter morning. Topped with a layer of brown sugar pears and pecans? Perfection.


Not only is this recipe simple and quick – requiring just 20 minutes from start to finish – it’s also customizable. If you’re not into steel cut oats, sub another grain like rolled oats, quinoa or millet. And if pears aren’t your thing, sub apples or even blueberries. Make this bowl your own and enjoy it often this winter. Cheers!

","Start your oats by bringing water to a boil in a small saucepan. Once boiling add a pinch of salt and then your oats. Swirl to coat then cover and turn heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the oats are tender.In the meantime, prepare your pears. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil or butter. Once bubbling, add brown sugar and stir. Then immediately add in pears, lemon juice and cinnamon and stir to coat. Cover to steam and soften the pears and cook for 10 or so minutes or until tender and golden brown. Once tender, remove the lid to allow them to caramelize a bit more. Remove from heat.Divide oats between two bowls (as original recipe is written) and top with equal servings of pears. I also added a few pecans, which added a nice crunch and more protein."
745,Vegan No-Bake Pumpkin Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy No-Bake Pumpkin Pie

Oh how I love pumpkin pie. My favorite variety is a family recipe that I shared last yeararound this time. But this year, I wanted to make a from-scratch vegan version that required as little effort as possible. I’m happy to report the experiment was a total success.

Though this recipe requires more than 10 ingredients and 1 bowl, hands on prep time is only 30 minutes and there’s no baking involved, making this recipe quite simple and totally worth the effort.
It starts with a no-bake, completely natural, vegan, and gluten-free crust made from dates, nuts, oats, and pumpkin pie spice.

Next comes the filling: A creamy vegan pumpkin pudding that comes together in about 10 minutes (plus chilling time). The result is a from-scratch pudding that’s thick, pumpkin-y and perfectly sweet. So gorgeous.

NOTE: While making this pie I accidentally discovered a secret way to make perfect coconut whipped cream even if you get a bad can!
It happened when I thought I’d grabbed the powdered sugar from my newly organized mason jar pantry when I’d actually grabbed the tapioca flour. It couldn’t have been more perfect timing because the can of coconut milk I’d bought was a dud, meaning it was still liquidy and unseparated after chilling. Humph.
I was ready to count it a loss when I accidentally added the tapioca flour and it thickened right up! I couldn’t believe it – literally thee best and thickest coconut whipped cream I’d ever made. And it stayed thick and luxurious in the fridge for days after. Plus, because tapioca flour is so fine it didn’t affect the flavor or texture one bit! I added in a little vanilla extract and powered sugar and ‘voila’ – perfection! I did try this method with a can that produced plenty of thick cream after my initial test and it didn’t seem to help as much. So I would only add tapioca flour in the case that your coconut milk is still liquidy after chilling as more of a “last chance” method of saving it.
More coconut whip tips:
– Make sure your coconut milk is fresh – I find the longer it’s set on the shelf the less likely it is to whip.
– Give cans a shake test in the store. If it does a lot of sloshing around it probably isn’t a good can.

Look at those peaks! Hubba hubba. Where should I put all that whipped cream?Oh yeah, ON MY PIE.

This pie is an absolute dream.
The crust is perfectly sweet and super moist, yet holds its shape.
The filling is like pumpkin heaven on a spoon.
And the coconut whipped cream MAKES it.
Make this pie this holiday season. Your family will love it! Also, stay tuned for an even simpler version coming soon. Hooray!



","To make the filling, place all dry ingredients in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Then add pumpkin puree and whisk again. Slowly pour in milk and stir again until well combined.Place over medium heat and bring to a low bubble - not boil - whisking often. Once it starts bubbling and getting thick, reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until a visible ribbon forms when spooning it across the top. It should be thick and kind of jiggly. During this process switch to a rubber spatula for stirring to ensure the pudding isn't sticking to the bottom or sides of the pan.Remove from heat and add vanilla and whisk. Let set for 5-10 minutes, then transfer to a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap, making sure the wrap TOUCHES the pudding - otherwise a film will form.Refrigerate for several hours or until completely chilled and set.In the meantime, prepare crust by adding dates to the food processor and pulse until it forms a ball - or at least until small bits remain. Remove from food processor and then add nuts, pumpkin pie spice and oats. Pulse until almost a meal, then add back in the dates a little at a time until a ""dough"" forms.Transfer to a lightly greased pie pan or small glass baking dish and press until uniformly flat and it comes up the edges 1.5-2 inches, making a crust (see photo). It doesn't have to be perfect, just make sure there are no gaps or cracks. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or set on counter until filling is chilled.When the pudding is ready, place a glass mixing bowl in the freezer to chill for a few minutes so you can prepare your coconut whipped cream (make sure the can has been chilled overnight to harden - otherwise it won't whip).Without shaking or tipping the can, remove the top and gently scoop out the top thick, solid portion of the coconut milk, known as the cream. Leave the clear liquid at the bottom of the can and reserve this for smoothies or other uses.Beat the cream to incorporate it. At this point it should start firming up, but if not add a couple Tbsp of tapioca flour and it should thicken right up! Then add in desired amount of powdered sugar 1 Tbsp at a time, as well as the vanilla extract. Cover and refrigerate until serving the pie.Once the crust and filling are both ready, pour the pudding over the crust and spread to smooth. Let it chill for several more hours or ideally, overnight. Top with coconut cream when serving. Will keep for several days covered in the fridge."
746,"Grilled Almond Butter, Chocolate, Pomegranate Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Grilled Almond Butter, Dark Chocolate, &amp; Pomegranate Sandwich

If you could just give me a moment…alone with this sandwich, I’d appreciate it.Hubba hubba.

I am a loyal fan of grilled sandwiches, especially of the cheese variety. But as I’ve shared before, I have to watch my dairy intake. You can’t keep a girl from her bread though, so to the drawing board I went. That’s about the time this beauty came to mind. Friends, I give you the grilled almond butter, dark chocolate, and pomegranate sandwich. Your taste buds will thank me.

The method for making this sandwich is as simple as it gets.Simply butter two slices of crusty bread, slather some almond butter inside and stack it high with quality dark chocolate and plenty of pomegranate arils. The result is an incredibly flavorful, satisfying sandwich that’s healthy enough to justify for lunch, yet decadent enough to call dessert.

This is kind of my dream sandwich. Technically I suppose banana would replace the pomegranate, but I am capable of branching out sometimes. Besides, pomegranates are a tasty and healthy way to branch out and they go perfectly with almond butter and dark chocolate.

I’m in love with this recipe! Almond butter and dark chocolate create a creamy, melty decadent filling while pomegranate arils burst with sweet, slightly tart flavor in every bite. And that perfectly-buttered, crispy crust? Don’t even get me started. Make this sandwich!

","Heat a large skillet over medium heat.Butter the outsides of the slices of bread, then slather the inside of half of the slices with almond butter.Next add 2 squares of chocolate on top of each of the almond butter slices and top with pomegranate arils. Top with the other slice of bread, buttered side up and place the sandwich in the skillet.Push down with a heavy spatula to compress. Gently flip when the bottom is browned and crusty – about 2-3 minutes. (be careful not to burn)Cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side. Serve immediately."
747,Persian Eggplant Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Eggplant &amp; Caramelized Onion Dip

Once upon a time I thought hummus and pita was the only known dip alternative to chips and salsa.
But then John’s aunt Nadia took us to an authentic Persian restaurant in San Diego where I was introduced to the wonder that is Persian Eggplant dip, also known as kashkeh bademjoon or borani. To keep things simple, let’s just call it Creamy Eggplant and Caramelized Onion Dip, and know that it is my absolute new favorite dip on the planet.

As always, this dip is simple; even more simple – and healthy – in fact, than traditional versions.
You don’t have to fry or even roast the whole eggplant, which douses it in grease and takes time. Instead, you roast it skin on in a little bit of olive oil and the skin peels right off. Easy, easy.

While your eggplant is roasting away in the oven, take a giant onion and some garlic and do the best thing you could possibly do to: Caramelize.
Something about soft, sweet, caramelized onions turn me into a ravenous food hog. I think I could’ve just eaten the whole pan and been in complete bliss. But, thankfully I resisted the temptation.

Once your eggplant and onion are ready just transfer them to a mixing bowl and give the whole thing a mash, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
The last step is to add a dollop of Greek yogurt, which makes it uber creamy. This obviously makes it not vegan, so you could sub tahini instead. But really this dip is so creamy as is you’d hardly miss it if you went without.
Top your dip with a few remaining spoonfuls of caramelized onion and you’re done! Persian eggplant dip in a cinch at home. And can I just tell you how insanely delicious this dip is? It’s:
Creamy
Sweet
Savory
Loaded with smokey eggplant and caramelized onion
Altogether satisfying
Light
&amp; Healthy
What more could you ask for in a dip?

This dip is traditionally served with some form of pita bread, which I highly recommend. This dip and bread were meant to be together.
You may wonder why I’m posting this dip in the middle of pumpkin and apple season. Well, the answer is it would be the perfect appetizer to take along to Thanksgiving dinners and holiday social gathers as it can be made vegan and gluten free and is absolutely sensational. Even picky eaters will love it. (Not to mention, it would be a lovely sandwich spread the day after with its creamy texture.)
Bring on the parties and social gatherings! I know what I’m bringing. Enjoy!

","Sprinkle your eggplant with salt on both sides and place in a colander in the sink to drain excess water. After 10 minutes, lightly rinse with water and then press dry between two towels.Preheat oven to high broil (or medium if you have the option) and position a rack at the top of the oven.Arrange eggplant rounds on a baking sheet drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Roast for 5-7 minutes, turning once or twice until eggplant is softened and golden brown. Remove from pan and let cool to the touch.While eggplant is roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 2-3 Tbsp olive oil. Add onion and stir often until caramelized – turn heat to low if browning too quickly. Add minced garlic in the last few minutes so it doesn’t burn. Set aside.Peel away the skin of the eggplant (if a little is left that’s OK) and add flesh to a mixing bowl. It should be soft and tender. Add onion-garlic mixture and mash with a fork. Season with salt and pepper to taste.OPTIONAL: Add 1/4 cup Greek yogurt and stir once more – this makes the dip ultra creamy, but is not necessary if vegan or dairy intolerant.Serve immediately with pita, toasted baguette, or assorted veggies. Best when eaten fresh, but it will keep in the fridge covered for a couple of days."
748,Vegan Pumpkin Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Spice Pancakes

A while back a friend from Portland messaged me and asked where in the world the pumpkin pancakes were on our site. GOOD QUESTION. Answer: Here they are! They’re here!

The truth is, I’d been planning on making pumpkin pancakes for a while now I was just waiting till November. (Hi, November!) And as soon as I walked outside recently and needed a coat I knew it was time. Oh I love this time of year, and not just for the pumpkin pancakes.


Can I just admit how much trouble I had with this recipe? I literally tested it 8 times – a new record around here. The problem was I was trying to pack too much pumpkin puree into the batter and it was causing them to be a bit too moist in the middle and not cook all the way through. IS THAT SUCH A CRIME? While we’re onthe topic of admitting shortcomings,I also love too much. Just thought you should know.
With all my failures I grew so frustrated I nearly threw in the towel on these guys. But for pumpkin pancakes, I knew must persevere. The final product was pretty sensational and totally worthy of sharing. Phew, that was a close one.

These pancakes are perfection: the perfect balance of fluffy and dense, sweet, spicy, and packed with pumpkin flavor. Plus, they’re easy to make, requiring just 20 minutes and one bowl. Not to mention, no fancy ingredients required – just your fall-time pantry basics like pumpkin, almond milk, spices and maple syrup.
Easy peasy and so worth the 20 minute effort.

These beauties are absolutely phenomenal topped with a bit of Earth Balance and maple syrup. I even added a bit more pumpkin pie spice on top for aesthetic effect, but it took them to a new level of delicious – highly recommended.
What more can I say about these cakes? Make them this fall! Your mouth will thank me.


","Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 350 degrees F / 176 C), or a large skillet on medium to medium-low heat on the stove stop. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot – oil shouldn’t burn when it hits the surface.Combine milk (starting with lesser end of range) and lemon juice in a large bowl and let rest for 5 minutes to curdle. Then add melted Earth Balance, maple syrup, pumpkin, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla extract and whisk to combine.Next add flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and spices to a sifter and sift over the wet ingredients. If the batter appears too thin, add a bit more flour. If too thick, add a splash of almond milk. If too thin, add a bit more flour. Let batter rest for 5-10 minutes.Butter or spray your griddle with cooking spray and pour 1/4 cup measurements of the batter onto the griddle. There should be 6-7 pancakes (as original recipe is written). Flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges turn slightly dry. Cook for 1-3 minutes more on the other side, then plate.Top with Earth Balance and maple syrup and a dash more pumpkin pie spice, or whatever else you desire. Will reheat well the next day in the microwave."
749,Vegan Fajitas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Poblano and Portobello Fajitas

For a brief period of my childhood, my family lived in New Mexico, and you better believe while there we ate our fair share of Mexican food. I was floating down a river of authentic refried beans and slow-cooked carnitas and garden fresh salsas and loving it. My little palette was in foodie heaven and I hardly even realized it. Those were the days.
But I don’t live in New Mexico any more. I live in Kansas, which means the Mexican food isn’t quite as authentic or abundant. I may be part Swedish, Irish and German, but I crave a ridiculous amount of south-of-the-border goodness. Lucky for me, John does, too. The solution? Make it myself.

The truth is, we eat some form of Mexican food at least three times a week, whether it’s quick lunches at Chipotle, black bean enchiladas or an impromptu taco bar. We can’t get enough of the stuff. But one meal I hadn’t tried at home yet was fajitas – one of my favorite meals to order at restaurants.
Something about the sizzling peppers and huge platter it comes out onand the self assembly – over-stuffing to the point of ridiculousness –makes me feel like a queen. A true foodie dream dish if you ask me.

These fajitas remain vegan thanks to bell and poblano peppers and juicy and satisfying portobello mushrooms, sauteed in just a few simple seasonings.
They’re no carnitas, but certainly delicious in their own right. I felt full after just two, which is saying a lot for me – a true quantity eater. I suppose the giant spoonfuls of guac didn’t hurt either.

If you aren’t a fan of mushrooms, simply omit them or sub in your favorite meat. For a vegetarian version opt for scrambled eggs or black beans. And to keep these gluten free, simply opt for corn tortillas – I went with flour because that’s traditionally how fajitas are served.
Count this recipe as inspiration and proof thatfajitas can be vegan and still totally, insanely delicious. Ole!

","Heat a large skillet and a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot add a dash of olive or coconut oil to the large skillet, then the onion and peppers. Season generously with salt, cumin and garlic powder.Cook until softened and slightly caramelized, stirring often. Set aside and cover to keep warm.At the same time, add a dash of oil to the medium pan. Then add the mushrooms. Season with a bit of salt and once softened and brown (see photo), add a dash of A1 (vegan-friendly) for more flavor (optional). Remove from heat, set aside and cover.Prepare guacamole by adding avocados to a bowl then adding lime juice and a generous pinch of salt. Fresh cilantro and onion are optional.Warm tortillas in the microwave or oven and you’re ready to go. Serve tortillas with peppers and onions, mushrooms, guacamole, and any other toppings you desire such as salsa, hot sauce, and cheese or sour cream (for non-vegan)."
750,Deep Dish Apple Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Deep Dish Apple Crumble Pie

It’s not apple season until a pie has been made. That or a crisp. But I’ve already made two of those so pie it is!

When apple season comes around it doesn’t seem right not to make a pie. It’s John’s favorite – and probably mine, too. Cherry and pecan don’t have anything on apple. But pumpkin? We’ll get to that later…


This pie was inspired by my love for all-things deep dish (hello simple deep dish pizza!), and my recent discovery of the perfect oat-pecan crumble(which is gluten free). I took this pie over to some friends and didn’t start it until an hour and a half before leaving, so it comes together pretty quick.
Another huge perk? It only requires one bowl! I love simple baking.

This pie is pretty decadent – definitely not health food. But if you’re going to indulge in dessert why not make it fruit?
The crust is a classic flaky crust that’s a family recipe, the filling is nothing but apple-cinnamon goodness, and the top is the perfect mixture of nutty, oaty, brown sugar goodness.
Your friends will thank you for making this pie. Mine did. Proof? It was gone by the evening’s end. Maybe I should’ve named this “5-Hour Apple Pie” – that’s how long it lasts. Enjoy!


","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).For the crust: Mix salt in flour and cut butter into flour with a fork or pastry cutter until well blended. Add enough water until the dough scrapes away from the bowl - usually about 3-5 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Remove from bowl, mold together with hands on a well-floured surface. Form into a 1-inch thick disc and then roll out into an even circle, adding more flour if it's sticky.Use the rolling pin to roll it up and lay it gently over a 10-inch cast iron skillet or pie baking dish and gently form it to the edges with your fingers. It should extend to the top of the pan but you don't have to crimp the edges or anything - we're going for rustic. Refrigerate until you're ready to add the apples.For the filling: Next prep the apples. Add them to the same bowl as you made the dough in and toss with sugar, cinnamon and flour. Add to pie crust and top with 1 Tbsp butter, scored into little dots or strips (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).For the topping: In the same bowl, add the crumble topping ingredients and mix with fingers or a pastry cutter until crumbly. Then pour it over the pie, spreading it evenly to coat. Bake at 400 for 35-45 minutes, or until the pie is warm and bubbly and the top is golden brown. If you notice the crumble top getting too brown, simply top it with foil.Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing."

You may not know this, but John and I are in Europe right now. Surprise!
We pulled a Well Traveled Couple and are off with friends exploring new countries in a foreign land. I couldn’t be more thrilled, a) that I’m actually touring through Europe right now eating pastries and wearing a scarf and b) that I can still bring you delicious eats at the same time. Oh the wonders of the internet. I love my job.

These waffles scream fall with healthy ingredients like pumpkin and cornmeal. I’ve made a sweet version of pumpkin cornbread waffles before, but was craving something a little less on the dessert side and a little more on the entree side. The experiment was a screaming success.

These waffles are super simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 1 bowl.Plus, they’re vegan and you likely already have all the ingredients you need on hand.
Pumpkin? Check. Cornmeal? Check. Everything else is basically necessity. How very convenient.

These waffles are crisp and cornbread-like with just a hint of pumpkin flavor. They’re also very customizable when it comes to seasonings and mix-ins. I went with salt and pepper and green onions. But I could also see garlic going really well here, as well as jalapenos, chives and even a handful of your favorite cheese (if you dare).
The awesome thing is you don’t have to go the savory route and add an egg on top like I did. You could just as easily slather them with a little butter and maple syrup and go to town. These would also go amazing with sliced avocado or some vegan beer chili! What? Who said that….
Oh yeah, I did. Enjoy-ee.

","Prepare flax egg in a large bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Add pumpkin puree, salt, pepper, baking powder, melted butter and whisk until well combined. Add almond milk and whisk once more.Next add flour and cornmeal and stir until just combined – small lumps are OK. Lasty, fold in chives or green onions. Your batter will be thick – let it rest for 5-10 minutes while preheating waffle iron.Generously spray waffle iron with non-stick pray and pour heaping 1/2 cup measurements onto the griddle. Close and cook according to manufacturer instructions (should be about 3 minutes).Serve warm with vegan butter and maple syrup for a sweet-savory combination, or vegan chili, sliced avocado and salsa, or a fried egg (for non-vegan)."
752,Veggie Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tofu That Tastes Good: Stir-Fry

I remember the first time I tried tofu. It was raw in a whole grain wrap along with some mustard and veggies and I honestly couldn’t finish it. And when it comes to food I’m a trooper. I’ll finish just about anything as I hate wasting food. But, tofu did not strike my fancy from the start and it’s never really been my favorite, even in my hardcore vegetarian days.
But, that all changed recently during a trip to San Antonio when I ate the best tofu of my life. It was in a veggie stir-fryover coconut brown rice at a restaurant called Green Vegetarian Cuisine. If you’re ever in the area you must stop by and try this dish. Your view of tofu will be forever changed – promise.

Two bites in and I was in heaven. I had to flag the waitress down and ask her how in the world they made the tofu taste so good! I thought it was fried, but it wasn’t. Haaaa-llelujah.
The best part? It wasn’t wet or soft or soggy or lacking in flavor at all like all of the tofu I’d tried prior. She rattled off a few instructions and I made a mental note. That same week I hopped in the kitchen and gave it a go myself.
It really worked you guys! I love tofu now. It might not be as delicious as Green Vegetarian Cuisine’s version, but it’s very close. And the more I practice the better I’ll get. I have a very good feeling about this.

The basic trick is first drying the tofu, then baking it at a high temperature to brown it and create a tougher texture, and then letting it set out to dry even more. This gives it a “meat-like” texture, if you will, that makes it much more porous to soak up delicious sauces and far more appetizing in the texture department. With this tofu I can’t help but finish it all – it’s too delicious not to!

For this recipe I made a quick and simple stir-fry but once you have the basics down this tofu could be used in just about any recipe you already love. It works extremely well in stir fries because they tend to be very saucy, but I also imagine it would be delicious over salad, in faux-egg salads and even with BBQ sauce.
I hope to incorporate it into more of the meals we regularly prepare to see just how versatile it is. But from what I’ve tasted so far, I have very high hopes.

Because it was diced, baked, left out to dry and then stir-fried in the sauce, the tofu soaked up so much flavor, rendering it absolutely irresistible. Try this tofu and let me know what you think! I think even your tofu-hating friends will approve.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and begin drying your tofu. Drain, remove it from the package and place between two thick towels folded into the shape of the tofu. Then place a plate or bowl on top and top it with something heavy like a book or skillet.Let it dry for about 15 minutes, changing your towels if they get too wet. Once dry, chop into roughly 1-inch cubes or rectangles (see photo).Arrange tofu on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent sticking and bake for a total of 25-35 minutes, flipping once halfway through to ensure even cooking. This will dry out the tofu and help give it a more meat-like texture. If you want a tougher texture, cook it for 30-35. For a slightly more tender texture, pull it out at 20-25 minutes to check.Once it’s golden brown and a bit tough and firm, remove from the oven set it out to dry a bit more while you prep your vegetables. Ideally, it would set out another 45 minutes or even longer. I haven’t tried letting it set out for much longer, but I don’t think it would hurt either way.If serving over rice, start the rice at this point.In a small mixing bowl, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients – set aside.To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add sesame oil and swirl to coat. Then add veggies and toss to coat. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring often. When the vegetables have some color and have softened a bit, add the sauce and stir. It should bubble and thicken. Then add the tofu and stir to coat.Cook the mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. When veggies are cooked to your preferred doneness, remove from heat. Serve as is or over rice for a more filling meal. Best when eaten fresh, though will keep in the refrigerator for a couple days."
753,Vegan Pumpkin Currant Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Currant Bread

Ahh, pumpkin bread – one of my favorite fall foods. Yes, as in: It deserves its own food group. WE’RE GOING THERE.


I’ve attempted pumpkin banana bread before but never straight up pumpkin bread. I threw some currants into this batch but honestly, I’m such a purist when it comes to breads that I think I’d even leave them out next time. Ya live ya learn.
Sorry currants, it’s nothing personal, I just discovered that dried cranberries and cherries will forever reign in my heart as favorite dried fruit. #sotangy #sogoooooood


This pumpkin bread is incredibly easy to make, requiring just 1 bowl and ingredients you likely have on hand this time of year. Customize it by subbing cranberries, baked apples, or nuts for currants. Or even chocolate! What? Who said that…?

This bread isn’t a super crumbly sugary bread, but rather a bit more dense and hearty. It’s the perfect healthier breakfast or snack, or fall party dessert. Top it with some pumpkin cashew frosting or dairy free cream cheese frosting and you’re in serious business. Like, whoa.

Wowee. It’s fall you guys. And if there’s one thing I love about this time of year it’s that my body begins craving slightly heartier, soul-warming foods. You know like muffins! Pumpkin muffins even. Oops! I didn’t even realize these ones have chocolate chips. Oh well. Guess I’ll have to eat them all.

That’s a total lie. The minute I decided to make pumpkin muffins I new I was going to dump a ton of chocolate chips in there. As if I even had a choice…


These muffins require just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes. The ingredients list is also really simple, with the basics being flour, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, almond milk, and chocolate chips.
If you’re not a big chocolate fan,you can just leave you could easily sub in oats or even apples!


These muffins are UBER moist; as in uber. Some might even be like, “Wow, that’s a moist muffin.” But is that such a bad thing?
I will say, however, if you prefer a more crumbly muffin, simply add in a touch more flour and/or a handful of oats to absorb more of the moisture from the almond milk and pumpkin.

Tender, sweet, moist, cinnamon-y (VEGAN!), and studded with melty chocolate chips. That’s what you can expect from these little guys.

I’ve been enjoying mine at breakfast with coffee and in the afternoon with tea. They really are the perfect snack or item to bring to a gathering. Pumpkin season has officially arrived and I couldn’t be more stoked. Hooo-ray!

755,Vegan Dirt Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Dirt Cake

If you’ve never had dirt cake – or as I know it: Kansas Dirt Cake – then you haven’t lived.
This cookies-n-cream creation was one of my absolute favorite desserts growing up and now that I’m an adult not much has changed, except for the fact that dairy gives me the queezies now. But since I don’t intend to deny my dirt cake cravings for a lifetime, I decided to make a vegan version. The result was a total winner.

It started with coconut whipped cream. The ladies at Lunchboxbunch and Oh, Ladycakes helped me on this one and I finally got a version that actually whipped up like the real stuff! Their tips were genius. I’m forever indebted to you Ashlae and Kathy.

Next came vegan cream cheese (like Tofutti), a 3-ingredient homemade version of vanilla pudding, a little powdered sugar. Look how beautifully this mixture whipped up!

Then we fold the two together: whipped cream into the cream cheese-pudding mixture and voila! We have dirt cake filling on our hands. All we need now is Oreos.


After pulverizing a bag of Oreos, pour half into the bottom of a 9×13 dish, and top with the filling. Ooh lala.


Dump the other half of Oreos on top, obvs.


And the finished product! Just toss in the freezer if you prefer more of an icebox-type texture. Otherwise, just chill in the fridge for 6-8 hours until completely set and chilled. then, dig in. If you freeze it you can slice it more into squares. If you refrigerate it, it’s more of a scooping situation. Either way is delicious, but I almost prefer freezing it first, then letting it set out to soften.
What’s left? EAT. EAT IT. Go on, no one’s looking.

This cake is insanely delicious and seriously close to the original.
The only real flavor difference is that it’s infused with a bit of coconut from the coconut whipped cream. However, the Oreos are really the dominant flavor, so even if you don’t like coconut give this a try! It’s the perfect indulgent treat for dairy-free, Oreo-loving folks. Enjoy!

","First make sure your coconut milk has been chilling in the fridge overnight or at least 8 hours. This will allow it to harden enough to whip into whipped cream.Prepare pudding by adding cornstarch and sugar to a small saucepan and whisking in almond or soy milk to avoid clumps. Cook over medium heat until it thickened and bubbling, stirring frequently. Then reduce heat to low and cook for 4-6 more minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrap the sides and bottom almost constantly. Once it appears ""jiggly"" and a visible ribbon forms when you drizzle some over the top with your spatula, remove from heat and let cool 10 minutes. Then transfer to a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set - 2-3 hours. At the same time, place a glass bowl in the freezer for your coconut whipped cream.When your pudding is almost set, whip your coconut whipped cream. Remove can from fridge, being careful not to shake or turn it and remove top. Gently scoop out the top hardened ""cream"" into the chilled bowl, leaving the liquid watery part behind. You can use this for smoothies or in baking, if you wish. Otherwise discard it.Use a handheld mixer to whip the coconut cream until it begins to look like whipped cream - about minute. Then add smaller measurement of powdered sugar (3 Tbsp as original recipe is written). Beat again until light and airy - about 2-3 minutes. Set in fridge.In a separate bowl whip the ""cream cheese"" until light and airy, then add in the remaining powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time (total 1 cup as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). By this time the pudding should be set. Add this to the cream cheese mixture and beat until well combined. Next fold in coconut whipped cream until incorporated. Set in fridge.In the meantime, pulverize your Oreos in a food processor or with a rolling pin and plastic bag.Spread half of the crumbs on the bottom of a 9x13 and tap on the counter to settle. Then pour over your cream mixture (see gif photo), and smooth with a spoon.Top with the other half of the crumbs and chill in the refrigerator for 6-8 hours or overnight. You can also freeze this for more of an ice-box texture, which I did for photos. However, I prefer the refrigerator chilled-version because it's softer and not icy. Will keep in the fridge for several days, or in the freezer for a couple of weeks."
756,Fresh Pumpkin Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Homemade Pumpkin Pasta

Several years ago I sat entranced watching Mark Bittman make pasta from scratch on his New York Times video column. I had no idea you could just up and make pasta. As far as I was concerned, pasta only came dried into sticks in a box. Mind -&gt; blown.

Years later Ifinallydecided to give it a go myself with a pumpkin spin in mind. You know, for fall. Plus it turned my noodles an uber pretty color.All you need for this 4-ingredient pasta is:
flour
eggs
pumpkin puree
salt
water
That’s it! So easy, eh?

Then you just boil your noodles for 1-2 minutes and choose your toppings and sauce.
I kept mine simple with basil pesto and parmesan cheese. You could also go a more fancy, pumpkin-themed route with my recipe for Spicy Pumpkin Mac ‘n’ Cheese, which can be found in our1 Cup Water e-Book.

Another perk of this recipe? You don’t need a pasta maker or crank. If you have a trusty rolling pin and a pizza cutter or knife, you’re in business.

Look at those fresh, fluffy noodles. Nothing like fresh pasta, according to Mr. Bittman. I 100% agree.
If you aren’t a big pumpkin fan, don’t fret as the flavor isn’t that prominent – it’s more of a hint and way to add some color. You could also sub pesto for the pumpkin for a super flavorful pasta, or just omit it altogether and add in one more yolk and one more whole egg as the original recipe suggests.

I loved this pasta with pesto. We also tried it with tomato sauce and it was just as tasty. Though I didn’t try it with my pumpkin cheese sauce, I’m sure it would be dreamy. Enjoy!

","Add flour and salt to a food processor and pulse. Then add in whole egg, egg yolks, and pumpkin puree. Pulse until well combined. Then drizzle in water until a dough forms (see picture).Transfer to a very lightly floured surface, sprinkle top with a little flour, and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside for 30 minutes to rest.After it’s rested, bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously.Cut the pasta into thirds and begin rolling out into a loose rectangle, sprinkling on only as much flour as it takes to keep it from sticking. More flour = a less flavorful, tender pasta. Also, the pasta will want to stick to the rolling pin – simply use one hand to hold it down while you use the other to roll.Once the dough is nearly paper thin, cut it into any shape you want. You can even leave it in a solid sheet if you’d like. I used a pizza cutter to cut mine into fettuccini-sized strips.Cover with plastic wrap until ready to cook. Add pasta to boiling water and stir just to make sure they don’t stick together. It should only take 1-2 minutes to cook.Drain and transfer to serving plate. Top with pesto and parmesan cheese, toss with your favorite tomato sauce, or try this easy pumpkin mac-n-cheese sauce."
757,How to Make Sushi at Home | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Sushi Without a Mat

John and I have a thing for sushi. Sticky rice, crunchy veggies, spicy seafood, plus that wasabi, ginger soy combo? Umami ftw.
Veggie, california, spicy tuna, fire spitting dragon (is that even a name?) – we eat it all. And while sushi is more of a treat that we save for nights out, it’s also fun to make it at home. But as you know, having one more thing around the house – i.e. a bamboo mat – isn’t really my thing. But you don’t need a mat to make sushi. You just need a few simple ingredients and a towel.

Yep, a towel.

Start by making the perfect sticky sushi rice and chopping up your veggies of choice.
We don’t have access to muchsushi-grade seafood in the Midwest, so I most often stick with veggies. But if you live near the coast, get crazy and do the dang thang. (Also, invite me over because I love seafood sushi.)

The towel trick:
A thick towel acts just like a bamboo mat and also wipes up your mess when you’re done: win-win. Because it’s so flexible it allows you to shape and roll the rice effortlessly into a beautiful roll. Oh how I love cutting corners.

This method not only allows you to make a traditional sushi roll, you can also go inside out (rice on the outside, nori on the inside). WHAAAATT?

Simply flatten on the rice, gently flip it over, top with veggies and roll away as usual.
You can even top your rolls with avocado by layering on thin slices of ripe avocado, topping it with plastic wrap and forming it once again with your towel. Slice, remove plastic and “voila.” So easy and a serious “wow” effect. Your friends will be impressed.

So what’s stopping you from making sushi at home? Nada. Now go forth and make rolls my child!

","Start by preparing your rice. Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer until your water runs clear. Then add to a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Once it boils reduce heat to low, cover and cook until water is completely absorbed – about 15 minutes.In the meantime, add vinegar, sugar and salt to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat stirring occasionally until sugar and salt are dissolved. Place in a jar or dish and cool in the fridge until rice is ready.Once the rice is done, kill the heat and add the cooled vinegar mixture and stir with a rubber spatula or fork as to not overmix. It will appear wet but will dry up as you lightly stir to release heat. It should be sticky and completely dry once it’s ready.In the meantime, prep your veggies by chopping them into thin pieces. If they’re too bulky they won’t allow the sushi to roll well.Now it’s time to roll: grab a thick towel and fold it over into a rectangle and place it on a flat surface. Top with plastic wrap, then with a sheet of nori. Using your hands dipped in water (to avoid sticking), pat a very thin layer of rice all over the nori, making sure it’s not too thick or your roll will be all rice and no filling.Then, arrange a serving of your veggies or preferred filling in a line at the bottom 3/4 of the rice closest to you (see photo).Start to roll the nori and rice over with your fingers, and once the veggies are covered, roll over the plastic wrap and towel, using it to mold and compress the roll (see photo). Continue until it’s all the way rolled up.Slice with a sharp knife and set aside.To make the inside out roll, follow this awesome tutorial. See photos for how to apply a layer of avocado on the outside.Serve immediately with pickled ginger, soy sauce and wasabi."
758,Pumpkin Spice Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Spice Latte Waffles

I love pumpkin.
I love coffee.
I love waffles.
Hooray! Party in the mouth right here, right now.

These waffles are my way of giving fall a big fat hug for arriving right on time. Or maybe fall is giving me a hug… either way, there’s a lot of hugging and waffle eating going on, and that’s OK with me.

John and I have been coffee snobs ever since living in Portland and being exposed to the wonder that is medium-roasted coffee; as in coffee that hasn’t been roasted to a burnt crisp.
I used to think, “the darker, the bolder, the better!” Now I know that coffee can actually taste like something other than ash.
However, the kind of coffee you want for these waffles is not the good stuff. In fact, I intentionally used over-roasted beans in this recipe because they get offset by the brown sugar and almond milk. Besides, you really don’t want to waste your good stuff on waffles – you want it straight into your face.
But really, any kind of bean will do. Just know the darker, the bolder the more you’ll taste it in the final product.



These waffles are uber simple, requiring just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes from start to finish. You also likely have all of the ingredients on hand. That is, if you’re a coffee and pumpkin lover. But I don’t know many people who aren’t, so I’ll go ahead and chalk that up as a given.



I am kind of smitten with these waffles, even though they threw me for a loop while recipe testing. I think I tried four times before finding just the right combination of ingredients – a true labor of love.
But the result was so worth it: tender, pumpkin-y waffles with lots of coffee and fall spice flavor. In my opinion, the perfect way to start a fall morning or lazy weekend at home. Plus, they toast up perfectly after being frozen. Enjoy!


","Prepare flax egg by combining water and flaxseed in a large bowl and letting rest for 5 minutes.Add pumpkin puree, oil, brown sugar, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice and whisk. Add almond milk and coffee and stir once more.Lastly add flour and stir until just combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes while preheating your waffle iron.Once preheated, generously spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and spoon about 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the iron and cook according to your machine’s instructions. I like to set mine to the darkest setting so it gets extra crispy.Once done, remove and place on cooling rack to let steam roll of and crisp up a bit. Serve warm with vegan butter (such as Earth Balance) and maple syrup. You could also mix your maple syrup with a bit of bold coffee or espresso for an extra special treat."
759,Sweet Potato Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Granola

Granola. Doesn’t it just scream fall? I love every kind, especially the pumpkin and spice varieties. Although I’ve never made a pumpkin granola myself, I thought sweet potato would be a fun experiment and an exciting route to take. And so I did (quite successfully, I might add).

This recipe begins with all things hearty and good: Nuts and oats.I opted for almonds, pecans, and pepitas, but you could really go with any nut or seed of your choice. Just make sure they’re untoasted lest they’ll burn in le oven.

This granola gets its gorgeous hue (in part) from sweet potato puree. Just bake up a sweet potato, puree a generous portion of its tender filling, and add it right into the wet ingredients. Slather the remaining portion with almond butter and shovel it directly into your face. Win win.

Sweet potato not only provides a slight sweetness and orange hue to this granola, it also provides a ton of health benefits.
Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin B6 (prevents heart attacks), vitamin C (wards off sickness), and vitamin D (boosts immune system), as well magnesium, which can help relieve stress. They also provide ample amounts of carotenoids – an antioxidants that helps fight cancer-causing free radicals in the body and even improve eyesight and immunity. Sweet potatoes are also high in fiber, iron, and potassium. The benefits are practically endless.

This granola is super simple to throw together. You just need:
Oats
Nuts
Sugar
Honey or maple syrup
Salt
Coconut oil
Sweet potato
Cinnamon
&amp; Dried fruit
I can imagine it would be equally delicious with pumpkin instead of sweet potato as well. I guess I’ll just have to try another batch to test out that hypothesis. Shucks.

I’m in love with this granola. It’s super crunchy and hearty and perfectly sweet and spicy from the cinnamon. Much to John’s pleasure, the sweet potatoes are not the dominant flavor, but rather another layer of flavor and sweetness.
The nuts give plenty of staying power, the cranberries a little tart sweetness, and the oats tons of fiber. Health in a bowl, I say.

I’ve been enjoying mine with almond milk or sprinkled on top of yogurt or a bowl of steel-cut oats. I’d imagine it’s also lovely on top of smoothies or straight outta the bag.
It’s simply the perfect fall food with its heartiness and spice. I can easily see it becoming a staple in our house in the chillier months to come. Though I’m not usually a fan of cold weather, if it involves lots of sweet potato granola I think I can get in the mood. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).Mix the oats, nuts, cinnamon, sugar,, and salt together in a large bowl.In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup) and sweet potato puree and whisk. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix well with a large wooden spoon.Spread the mixture evenly onto two baking sheets (or bake in two batches // use more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size) and bake for 20-25 minutes, stirring a bit near the halfway point. If you like a chunkier granola, don’t stir as it breaks up the clusters. Instead, just rotate the pans at the halfway point to ensure even cooking.Add the craisins or other dried fruits, and any toasted nuts to the baking sheet in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking so they don’t get too toasty.Once the granola is visibly beginning to brown (usually 20 minutes), remove from the oven, and let cool completely. Transfer to an airtight container. Should keep for a couple weeks."
760,Baked Apple French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Apple French Toast Bake

Wow, I don’t even know where to start with this french toast…
It was inspired by myPumpkin French Toast Bake.
It is perfect for fall.
It is INSANELY delicious – crispy, tender, gooey, satisfying.
It’s packed with cinnamon-sugar apples.
It requires just 7 ingredients.
It can be made in 1 morning – no overnight soaking involved.
That was a mouthful but seriously, you NEED this french toast in your life!

It starts with day old wheat bread cut into cubes and left out to dry. Use my recipe for7-ingredient wheat breadfor a from-scratch experience. Otherwise, any crusty bread will do.

Next, 2 tart and 2 sweet apples for a nice sweet-tart balance.

Now we soak, just as long as it takes to saute the apples. That’s plenty of time to let the bread cubes get all marinated in eggy goodness.

The apples are so simple! Just saute with a little butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar until tender. That’s it. I could’ve eaten this whole pan, no lie.


Oh man, look how delicious and eggy and crusty and apple-stuffed this french toast is! Does it get any better for a healthy fall breakfast?


Bring on the syrup, PLEASE.


This french toast bake is literally the fall breakfast of my dreams. It feeds a crowd! And it’s:
Easy
Wholesome
Loaded with cinnamon + apples
Tender in the inside
Crusty on the outside
&amp; Perfect topped with more apples and maple syrup
I think I died and went to heaven devouring my slice.

I think you get the point. MAKE THIS FRENCH TOAST! It has my food blogger guaranteed stamp of approval on it. If you don’t like it, you’re crazy. It’s as simple as that. Happy fall everybody!

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and grease a 9x13 baking pan (adjust number or size of pan if altering batch size).Add bread cubes to the baking pan - enough to generously cover the bottom and up about 1.5 inches. You don't want to see any bare spots on the pan, but you also don't want there to be bread overflowing out of the dish.In a mixing bowl whisk the eggs, milk, and 2/3 of the cinnamon (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). Pour over the bread and use your hands or the back of a wooden spoon to push the bread down to soak up the liquid. If you end up having too much bread after pouring on the liquid, just pick a few out. Alternatively, if you have too much liquid, add more bread cubes. (see photo)To a large skillet over medium-low heat, add the apples and butter. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 of the cinnamon (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written), stir and cover to steam for a bit. When they start to get tender - about 4-5 minutes - remove cover and sprinkle with 2-3 Tbsp brown sugar (this will depend on preference and whether you used sweet or tart apples // amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Continue cooking with cover off until tender and slightly caramelized. You don't want them to get mushy so be careful not to keep the cover on for too long. Remove from heat to cool slightly.Check the bread to make sure all pieces are getting well soaked. If any cubes are dry on top, flip them over with your hands to ensure all pieces are wet. Sprinkle top with remaining brown sugar - about 1/4 cup (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Next spoon 3/4 of the apples over the top of the bread and push them down into the cracks with your fingers. If a few slices are sitting on top, that's OK (see photo).Bake on a center rack for 45 minutes to 1 hour. You'll know when it's done because the bread and apples will be golden brown and the egg mixture will no longer be wet. Stick a fork down in the center to check - if it's still jiggly or wet, bake for another 5-10 minutes.Remove from oven and serve immediately. Top each slice with any remaining sautéed apples and maple syrup. Store leftovers in a covered container in the fridge for up to a couple of days and reheat in the microwave; though this dish is best when fresh."
761,Homemade Bread Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Homemade Wheat Bread

The first time I attempted real homemade bread was with my 7-Ingredient Muesli Bread recipe. I was so thrilled with how it turned out I decided to try it again, only this time with whole grains. Mmmm, I love me some whole grains.

In my original recipe I let the dough rise TWO hours in the fridge. But for this loaf, I was impatient and only let it rise ONE hour in a warm spot. It still puffed up just fine. The only difference was it didn’t hold its “loaf” shape as much and kind of spread out, but I was totally OK with that. It still tasted great.

To add more whole grain goodness I kneaded in rolled oats and millet after the first proof. I LOVED the result – the little grains and oats made me feel extra good about all this extra bread I’ve been consuming (wink).

This bread requires just 7 ingredients.
Instant yeast
Water
Salt
Wheat flour
Unbleached all-purpose flour
Oats
Millet
That’s it. And it’s virtually foolproof. Just mix, let rise, knead in the grains, proof once more, and bake! The result is a beautiful, grainy loaf that’s tender on the inside and crusty on the outside – just how it should be.

I hope you enjoy this bread! We’ve been enjoying it toasted with butter and jam for breakfast. It would also make lovely sandwich bread.
NOTE: But be sure to check back Tuesday for a NEW french toast recipe featuring this bread! Trust me, it’s worth holding on to the majority of this loaf for. Stay tuned!

","Combine warm water (like bath water, or about 110 degrees F / 43 C) with yeast in a large mixing bowl and let set for 5 minutes to get foamy. Then add salt and flours and stir with a wooden spoon. The result will be a sticky, rough dough.Lift the dough out of the bowl and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in the refrigerator for two hours or in a warm place for 1 hour.Once doubled in size, lightly sprinkle the dough with flour and transfer to a generously floured work surface. Knead a few times adding flour as needed and then add oats and millet in batches. Knead until until grains are incorporated and the dough is no longer sticky.Place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top to help keep the dough moist. Let rest for 45-60 minutes.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C) and place a metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).When ready to bake, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ½-inch deep.Place bread in oven and carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Close oven door quickly.Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown and crusty.Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a rack. Once fully cooled, store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temp."
762,Easy Stuffed Shells with Dairy-Free Filling | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Stuffed Shells with Roasted Eggplant

I really love pasta; pasta of all kinds. Fettuccine happens to be my favorite but stuffed shells take a close second. As of late, however,dairy has been bothering my system more than usual so I’m currently experimenting with new recipes that keep cheese and other dairy products at bay. Easier said than done.
These shells were my first attempt and they came out a supreme success. I actually just had the leftovers for lunch and grinned the whole time I shoveled them in. I couldn’t believe how rich and satisfying they were with no cheese. Bonus: I couldn’t even detect tofu. Win!

So the filling for these shells is simple:
Tofu
Dairy-free mozzarella shreds (I tried Go Veggie)
Roasted Eggplant
Pesto
That’s it! All that’s left is the shells and red sauce, making this an 8-ingredient meal that only takes 1 hour from start to finish.

If you’ve never tried eggplant in Italian dishes, you’ve been missing out. The roasted eggplant pieces in the filling kind of make these shells. Doused in tomato sauce it’s like heaven on a fork.

John even tried these and said he probably wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between these and normal stuffed shells had I not told him. That’s a HUGE win in my book because he’s not a huge fan of tofu (nor am I).
Thankfully, these shells passed the test and will definitely be taking the place of cheesy versions from here on out. My stomach couldn’t be more thrilled either.

","FOR THE EGGPLANT: Sprinkle eggplant rounds with sea salt and place in a colander over the sink to let drain. After 10 minutes rinse lightly and then pat dry. Slice into quarters, place on a cookie sheet and toss in olive oil and sea salt. Broil for 5-10 minutes or until slightly browned and softened, tossing once or twice to ensure even roasting. Set aside.Next, bring a pot of water to a boil and add shells and a pinch of sea salt. Stir once and cook according to package instructions. Also, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).While the shells are cooking, add tofu to a food processor and pulse a couple times to break it up. Then add pesto, a healthy pinch of sea salt, dairy-free mozzarella shreds and mix until just combined. Taste a little and see if you need more salt or pesto. Then stir in roasted eggplant.Once the shells are done, drain and let cool slightly. Pour 1/2 cup red sauce in the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron or 8×8 pan (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), then stuff shells with generous spoonfuls of filling.Arrange shells split side up in the pan and then top with remaining tomato sauce – they should be covered but not drowning. Bake for 35 minutes or until warm and bubbly. Serve immediately. These go great with Caesar salad, steamed broccoli and/or garlic bread."
763,Easy Vegan Cinnamon Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls

I once drove 2 hours before work at 5:30 in the morning in the pitch black just to get a cinnamon roll at an Amish bakery. That’s how much I love cinnamon rolls, and apparently how unwilling I am to make them myself. Go figure.

Why doesn’t anyone make cinnamon rolls? They’re complicated, difficult and time consuming. That’s why.
But these cinnamon rolls are different:
7 ingredients
No complex steps
No difficult methods
Practically fool proof
Just straightforward, fluffy, gooey goodness in cinnamon-roll form.
Oh yeah, and they’re vegan. Holy friggin’ delicious.

I was able to keep the ingredients to a minimum by narrowing down what you really need in a cinnamon roll and forgetting the rest. And then I went a step further and tested the true need for “scalding the milk” and letting them rise a second (sometimes third) time.
Turns out? Not necessary. And they turned out JUST AS DELICIOUS as bakery fresh cinnamon rolls. This, my friends, is my new go-to cinnamon roll recipe and it just so happens to require 7 ingredients and one lazy morning’s preparation. Behold, the World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls.



When I pulled these beauties out of the oven I was mesmerized. I couldn’t believe how fluffy and perfect they looked despite minimal ingredients and time.
Although a glaze isn’t really necessary or within the 7-ingredient limit, it’s an easy last-minute addition that will send them over the top. In other words, highly recommended for pure cinnamon roll bliss.


These rolls are:
Fluffy
Soft
Sweet
Tender
Cinnamon-y
Easy
&amp; Satisfying
In other words, perfection. Hooray for easy cinnamon rolls, finally!


","DOUGH: In a large sauce pan (or in a bowl in the microwave at 30-second increments), heat the almond milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 110 degrees F (43 C) or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add 1 Tbsp sugar and the salt and stir.Next add in flour 1/2 cup (68 g) at a time, stirring as you go (you may not add it all). The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball (be careful not to overmix). Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with avocado or olive oil, and add your dough ball back in. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size (see photo).FILLING: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Brush with melted vegan butter and top with sugar and desired amount of cinnamon.Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in a well-buttered 8x8-inch square or comparable sized round pan (you should have about 10 rolls as original recipe is written). TOPPING: Brush with vegan butter (melted) and cover with plastic wrap. Set on top of the oven to let rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve immediately.Optional: Frost with dairy-free cream cheese frosting or a simple mixture of 1 cup (112 g) organic powdered sugar and 1-2 Tbsp (15-30 ml) almond milk."
764,Baba Ganoush Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Baba Ganoush

Baba Ganoush requires a grill:False
Baba Ganoush requires a gas stove: False
Baba Ganoush can be made by anyone anywhere with access to a broiler: True
Hooray!

Have you ever looked at a recipe and rolled your eyes, thinking, “Yeah, right. I’m never making that it’s way too complicated.” Welcome to the story of my life and the idea behind this blog.
I love simplicity and figuring out new, easy ways to make delicious eats – such as baba ganoush, one of my favorite Mediterranean dishes.

Baba ganoush is just basically eggplant blended up with lemon juice, tahini and sea salt. Typically you have to char the eggplant on a grill or over the flame of a gas stove. I currently do not have access to a gas stove, and while I have a grill I recognize some people don’t.
My solution:Slicing the eggplant into rounds and broiling it to get that roasty, charry goodness. The result? Time and energy saved, and it’s just as delicious as the traditional method if not better. Muahahaha, I love breaking the rules.

So, all you need for this dip is:
1 eggplant
1 lemon
garlic
tahini (how to make your own)
sea salt
Optional: fresh herbs. Totally unnecessary but great for an extra flavor boost + more color.

What’s it taste like? Uber creamy, decadent, slightly sweet and the perfect balance of savory and tangy from the lemon and tahini. It’s so lush and creamy you can hardly believe it’s vegan and doesn’t require gobs of oil.
Friends, if you’ve ever had baba ganoush this version might blow you away. Try it and let me know what you think. In the meantime, I think I’ll just face plant into this entire bowl.

","Preheat oven to high broil (or medium if you have the ability) and position a rack at the top of the oven.Slice your eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and sprinkle with sea salt and place in a colander in the sink to drain any excess liquid. After 10 minutes, rinse slightly and then pat dry between two towels.Arrange on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Roast for 5-10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the eggplant is softened and golden brown. Remove from pan, stack and wrap the rounds in foil to lock in moisture – wait 5 minutes.Peel away most of the skin of the eggplant (a little is OK) and add flesh to a food processor. It should be soft and tender and the skin should come off easy.Add lemon juice, garlic, tahini, a pinch of salt and mix until creamy. Add herbs last and pulse to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more tahini and another pinch of salt.Serve with pita and/or pita chips and veggies. Will keep covered in the fridge for several days."

You guys, these are even better than the originals. Trust me, I just ate two at once to double confirm and they’re in factBETTER.
Roger that, over.

What’s the difference between these bars and the first batch? Well, almond butter is the base instead of peanut butter and we added one very essential, very key ingredient: CHOCOLATE CHIPS, YO.


These granola bars are SO easy to make, per usual. All you need is:
Dates.
Oats.
Pecans (or any nut).
Almond Butter.
Chocolate Chips.
&amp; Honey (or maple syrup/agave).
Even better? They’re no-bake and take virtually no time at all. That’s my kinda bar. And look, Ma! No GMOs! (Or other random fillers, chemicals, preservatives, and suspicious dyes.) Win!

Theses little guys are seriously amazing. I made 10 two days and we’re already down to 4. As in, I alone have eaten two a day three days in a row. WHOOPS. Too good, I couldn’t help it.
Texture: Slightly sticky, soft but not crumbly, and crunchy from the nuts.
Flavor: Almond butter, pecans, and dark chocolate chips were meant to be together – period.

So, why haven’t you made these yet? I don’t know either. I’m putting my unofficial satisfaction guarantee on them, however that works with food blogs and the internet. Just trust me – you will LOVE these bars!

","OPTIONAL: Toast oats in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 15 minutes to give a toasted flavor. Not necessary but recommended.Place dates in a food processor and mix until small bits remain and they form a ball. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and add oats, nuts, and chocolate chips. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking down the dates so they disperse fairly evenly throughout the ingredients. Small chunks are OK.Warm honey and almond butter in a small saucepan and pour over dry ingredients. Stir quickly to evenly coat. The chocolate chips will get a little melty - that's fine and even desirable.Transfer to a shallow pan (such as 8x8 or loaf pan) lined with parchment or plastic wrap and top with another piece of plastic wrap and use your hands to form the mixture into a tight square (keeping in mind you want them about 1/2 thick and you'll cut them into 10-12 bars // amount as original recipe is written) with a uniformly flat top. This will take a little work but the warmth of your hands will work well to shape them.Still covered, pop them into the freezer to set for 15 minutes. Remove and cut into 10 bars (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Store in an airtight container or bag in the fridge to keep fresh, or in the freezer for longer term storage."
766,Chocolate Hazelnut Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Hazelnut No-Bake Cookies

This summer John and I went to Indonesia. I know, random place to go, but our friends live in South Korea and were going to Bali (Indonesia) for vacation and invited us along. Because of all our free airline miles, we thought “what the heck, let’s go to Bali.” And so we did. And behold, that is where I stumbled upon perhaps the cutest little coffee/food/gelato cafe I’ve ever stepped foot in: Sea Circus.
Thanks to the recommendation of a fellow blogger who lives in the area, we happened upon this somewhat familiar “American” food establishment with a Balinese twist. Oh man was it delicious. And the coffee! When you haven’t had good coffee for 10 days + and then someone puts a proper capp in front of your face, you could just die. Just literally die. Don’t even get me started on the tacos…
Another reason I loved this place? They had BACIO (chocolate-hazelnut) gelato that was rich and chocolaty and intense with hazelnut flavor thanks tiny bits of hazelnut blended right into every bite. It was intense.


Ever since I slurped down that bacio gelato cone I could NOT shake the idea of making chocolate-hazelnut cookies from my mind. And so to the kitchen I went to test. After one raw batch and one baked, I heavily preferred the no-bakes. I mean, 4 ingredients, no butter or sugar or baking, AND they tasted better? It was kind of a no-brainer.

These cookies require just 1 bowl, 5 minutes and 4 ingredients, meaning they fit ALL THREE requirements for the recipes on this blog. A trifecta of simplicity, if you will. But that doesn’t mean they skimp on flavor or texture one bit.
The dates provide ample sweetness and fudginess.
The cocoa powder gives them that slightly bitter chocolatetaste.
The hazelnuts add that essential nuttiness &amp; “bacio” profile.
And semisweet chocolate chips add yet another layer of chocolate decadence.
This humble cookie is kind of my bliss. Now, if I could only get back to Sea Circus sometime for another scoop of bacio gelato, then my bliss tank would be all the way full. Until then, let them eat baciocake cookies!

767,Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake

Wow. Where do I start with this cake?
It’s absolutely incredible, moist, hearty, slightly crumbly, sweet, and delicious. That’s where.


Our air conditioner happened to go out the weekend I baked it, which meant sweat was pouring down my hairline as I was whipping up the icing. It was a true act of love and so, so worth it.


The minute the cake was done I popped it in the freezer so I could ice it as quickly as possible, with THIS STUFF. Dairy-free cream cheese icing. Thank you dairy-free “dairy products.” My gut owes you one.

In this here icing we have:
Tofutti dairy-free cream cheese
Earth Balance vegan butter
Vanilla extract
&amp; Powdered shuga
So creamy, light, slightly tangy, and just as good as the real stuff – guaranteed.

Let’s put it on that cake, shall we?


Wow. This cake is INSANE. The almond meal gives it a nutty, hearty texture and flavor. The zucchini adds moisture and plenty of vitamins C and B and fiber. Applesauce and cane sugar add just the right amount of sweetness. And the icing sends it over the TOP!
To keep this cake gluten-free, I used gluten-free oats, almond meal and my favorite gluten-free flour blend. The good thing is it has many elements + an egg for binding, so even if you use a slightly different flour blend, it should turn out fine.

I HAD to have this cake before the summer ended. I adapted the recipe from a family favorite that belongs to my aunt Donna. Donna and I have so much in common: July birthdays, loud laughs, and an extreme love for sweets. No wonder she and I gush over this cake…

If you are skeptical of your ability to bake a gluten-free cake, don’t be. This one only requires 1 bowl!
This cake is also very forgiving. I made it the next day as cupcake/muffins and they turned out wonderfully. The important thing is: Make this recipe! Your family and friends will love you for it – promise.

","Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (148 C) and butter and flour an 8x8 pan with dairy-free butter or cooking spray and gluten-free flour.In a large mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, oil, applesauce, eggs, and zucchini. Add vanilla, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Lastly add almond meal, gluten free flour blend, and gluten free oats and whisk again to combine. The batter should be slightly thick but very easy to pour.Pour batter into your pan and bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour, or when a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the edges are golden brown.While cooling, make your frosting by beating dairy-free butter and cream cheese together, then add vanilla and beat again. Add powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time until you reach desired consistency and sweetness. It should be fairly thick but still spreadable.Once the cake is fully cooled, frost and serve immediately. You'll have leftover frosting.The cake should keep covered in the fridge for several days, or in the freezer for several weeks. However, it's best when eaten fresh. Let set out for 10-15 minutes before serving if refrigerating so it warms a bit and becomes more tender.To adapt this recipe into more of a zucchini bread, reduce the cane sugar to 1/2 cup (as original recipe is written) and forgo the icing!"
768,Vegan Chocolate Avocado Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Triple Chocolate Avocado Shake

I used to sport a bow tie for work. It’s true. My senior year of high school I got a job at a diner inside a movie theatre that required me to wear a bow tie, purple apron and white button up shirt with visibly ironed creases. Our manager was kind of anal, just like all underpaid managers on an ego trip. If it wasn’t for all the “discounted” (read: free) dessert that came my way, I would’ve ripped off that plastic name tag and fled the movie scene on week 1.
But you guys, did you hear that? I had unlimited access to free dessert including my favorite milkshake of all time: Hot fudge, peanut butter banana. Ughughughg. That job was so worth it.

These days if I were to eat a hot fudge, peanut butter banana milkshake, my insides would shake a proverbial fist at me for days. Oh the woes of growing up and having to take care of yourself.
So why make a healthier shake? A reader actually wrote recently and requested my take on an avocado chocolate shake. I leapt at the challenge. To start I focused on the base, which I kept 100% frozen to make it ultra creamy and thick – just the way I like my milkshakes.


The triple chocolate comes from the three C’s.
Chocolate Almond Milk
Chocolate Sauce (or Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge)
Cocoa Powder
Boom bam boom; chocolaty goodness.

And that’s really it! Frozen banana, frozen avocado and the three C’s. And what you end up with is an ultra-luxurious creamy vegan chocolate shake that’s actually good for you. I mean, there’s a whole avocado in there! Hello health benefits.

No, this may not replace a hot fudge, peanut butter banana shake. But it does satisfy that ice cold, uber creamy, super chocolatey shake of my yester-years. And it just so happens to be made with wholesome ingredients. That’s a shake my system can jive with, and, even thrive on. Cheers!


","Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Adjust flavor/sweetness as needed, adding a bit of agave or stevia for added sweetness, and chocolate sauce for more rich chocolate flavor.Divide between two small glasses (as original recipe is written), or guzzle the whole thing by yourself."
769,Vegan Blue Cornmeal Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Blue Cornmeal Waffles

It’s almost fall and the anticipation of it all is turning me into somewhat of a romantic.
One of my favorite fall memories took place two years ago. John was still in law school and we’d gone to church with some friends in Lawrence – the city that’d become our literal oasis during our dreadful 2-year stay in the state capitol. It was the first day with a substantial chill. The leaves were in glorious transition to gold and red and appeared like a carefully-painted landscape along the highway as we made the lazy drive back home. Greg Laswell was blaring, numbing our ears, and I felt gratitude welling up in me like a tide, and it was all I could do not to cry. But I did, for quite some time. I wasn’t sad; I had inexplicable joy.
Fall has a way of doing that inside me. It provides relief, a sense of newness, coats and scarves, and my heavens does it provide ample opportunities for baking.

One of my favorite fall flavors is cornbread, paired with chili and toasted into croutons for hearty salads – I could eat the stuff every day. I only tried blue cornmeal for the first time last year and fell in love. Its slightly grainier texture and brilliant color make it perfect for baking into hearty breakfast treats, muffins and breads galore.
Blue cornmeal gets its gorgeous hue from anthocyanins:water-soluble pigments that also act as powerful antioxidants, making blue corn a super healthy food to add to your diet this fall.



These waffles are so simple to make, requiring just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes. They’re also vegan and gluten free.
I love the texture of these guys. Super grainy and ultra crispy, and just slightly sweet. They make the perfect vessel for butter and maple syrup, as well as bananas and fruit compotes like blueberry. Make them even heartier by serving a fried egg on top, or with almond or peanut butter.
Plus, they freeze well and toast up perfectly, making them especially convenient for quick breakfasts and lunches on the go.

So bring on the waffles this fall. And the cornbread. I’m already getting beyond excited to dwell in the kitchen as the temps drop to create tons of new soul-warming dishes in this space. Here’s to a lovely start.



","Combine almond milk and lemon juice in a large liquid measuring cup and let set for a few minutes to curdle/activate. Then add melted butter, vanilla extract and agave nectar and whisk. Set aside.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Let set for 10-15 minutes while your waffle iron preheats.Once waffle iron is hot, generously coat with non-stick spray and pour on about 1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a baking rack in a 200 degree oven to keep warm. Do not stack - instead, keep them in a single layer to ensure crispiness remains.Serve immediately with desired toppings. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results. Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple months, although they’re best within the first couple weeks."
770,Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge

I’ve had vegan hot fudge before, but this is on a whole other level. I mean Kahlua, come on.

The basis for this recipe is simple: coconut cream, sugar, vanilla, cocoa powder, sugar and sea salt. Then in a fit of boozy glory you add in two shots of Kahlua – the ultimate coffee-flavored liqueur. I don’t have to tell you that chocolate and coffee belong together but I will.
CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE BELONG TOGETHER. There, now you know.

This fudge comes together in a matter of minutes. Here’s so:
1. Crack open your can of coconut milk and scoop off the top cream.
2. Whisk it in a saucepan with sugar, cocoa powder and sea salt.
3. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and Kahlua.
4. PUT IT ON EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED EVER.
5. The end.

The flavor of this fudge is NOT overwhelmingly coconut-y like you’d think. The chocolate and Kahlua are actually the dominant flavors. The coconut cream simply gives it a slight hint of coconut and a super thick texture.
In fact, after refrigerating it pretty much becomes mousse. Yeah, CHOCOLATE KAHLUA MOUSSE.


","Open your unshaken can of coconut milk (refrigerated or not) and use a spoon to scrape off the top layer of thick cream, reserving the watery, liquid portion for smoothies or other uses.Add cream to a sauce pan over medium-high heat and add cocoa powder. Whisk to combine and cook for a few minutes. Add sugar and salt and whisk - cook until warm and bubbly - 5 minutes. Reduce the heat if you see it getting too bubbly.Remove from heat and add vanilla and Kahlua and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavors as needed. You may prefer more Kahlua or vanilla than I did.Transfer to a clean glass jar or bowl to let cool. Once room temperature, cover and refrigerate. Will keep for a couple weeks. Either reheat in the microwave before serving, or warm in a saucepan of simmering water."
771,Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches

So you know I made dairy-free chocolate ice cream.
And you also know I made simple vegan brownies.
Well then, may the two worlds collide into one delicious sandwich.
An ice cream sandwich, that is.

These little guys were a no brainer. I love ice cream sandwiches and always have. Ask anyone who saw me as a child with a constant ring of ice cream around my mouth.

Anytime I have ice cream in the house and anything half resembling a cookie, I mash them together. Don’t ask.
Because my brownies were tall, I sliced them in half and sandwiched the ice cream in between. With thinner brownies you can simply stack two. But if you did that with these you would need four more mouths to get your lips around them. Dessert shouldn’t be that strenuous in my opinion.


These sandwiches are so simple to throw together and you can really use any ice cream or brownie you have on hand. I was tempted to add a layer of caramel in between but decided to be a purist for once and let them be. But next time, nuts, caramel, and sprinkles – I’m calling your name.
If you’re wondering why this brownie is so close to your face, blame it onTHIS LENS– the love of my food photography life right now. Talk about details. You’d be wise to snatch one up. More deets on what’s in our camera baghere.

","Remove ice cream from the freezer to let soften.In the meantime, gently cut brownies in half with a serrated knife.Line a 1/2 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap and pack with softened ice cream. Fold the plastic wrap over the bottom tightly and remove from measuring cup. Loosely form with hands into a disc. Place in freezer. Repeat until you have four. Freeze for 15 minutes or until slightly hardened.Unwrap ice cream and place on top of brownies. Top with the other half and gently squeeze the two together to make a snug sandwich. Eat immediately or re-wrap with plastic wrap and store in a freezer safe bag or container for up to a week or so. Best when eaten fresh."
772,Garam Masala Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garam Masala Hummus with Toasted Sesame Seeds
This recipe is in honor of my love for all-things hummus. Hummus is yummus; it’s science.
I remember the first time I heard of hummus. I was getting my haircut by my super trendy hair stylist at the time, way back in like 2007 and she started telling me how all of the “cool restaurants” are now serving hummus as an appetizer.
Hummus. I was intrigued. So I ventured out and located a nearby Mediterranean restaurant and went head first into my first bite of the creamy, garlicky dip I’m now so fond of. It was love at first bite. There’s no going back now.

For this recipe I didn’t have any tahini on hand but I DID have some sesame seeds! So I toasted them up, put them in the food processor with a bit of grapeseed oil and voila! I had tahini on my hands! Just like store-bought but WAY better and creamier! You should do it sometime – it’s much more cost effective and super easy.

So this hummus. It’s flavored with garam masala – a traditional Indian spice blend that usually includes cinnamon, cumin, coriander, black pepper, clove, nutmeg and chili.
You find it at most markets these days, but I decided to try my hand at a batch of my own. And thanks to the help of the Kitchn– my go-to for all-things kitchen basics and DIY – it was a total success. Hoorah!

This hummus is so quick, easy and flavorful! You only need:
Chickpeas.
Garlic.
Fresh lemon juice.
Tahini (that you made yo’self)
Sea salt.
Olive oil.
Paprika.
&amp; Garam masala.
Then you’re in biznass, like WHOA.
Take a tip from me. The toasted sesame seeds on top MAKE this. I remember seeing Jessica do a similar technique with her Everything White Bean Hummus (OMG) and she was super onto something. Make this hummus STAT. You’ll thank me when you’re noshing down on garlicky, spicy, creamy goodness.
kthanksbye.

","Add all ingredients except the olive oil and garam masala to a food processor and blend until smooth.While blending, add olive oil through the spout.Once blended, add garam masala 1/4 tsp at a time until you reach your preferred level of flavor. I went with 1 tsp (amount as original recipe is written), and also added a bit more lemon juice. Adjust seasonings to your preference.Serve and sprinkle with more garam masala and toasted sesame seeds.Serve with pita, pita chips and veggies. Will keep covered in the fridge for up to a week."
773,Vegan Whole Grain Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Whole Grain Waffles with Roasted Stone Fruit

The recipe I was planning to make for this post was stuffed french toast. But sometimes, you don’t feel like french toast. You feel like a hearty, grainy, not-too-sweet waffle.
So, that’s what I did. The result? Hearty, whole grain vegan waffles that just happen to pair perfectly with roasted stone fruit. Oooh yeah.

The batter is simple and can be modified according to what you have. For sweetener I went the natural route: sucanat – natural cane sugar – and molasses.
I loved how the sucanat had a caramel-like flavor, plus it’s healthier than standard table sugar when it comes to blood sugar spikes. And the molasses had me screaming for fall to arrive right this second. Molasses and fall go together like Bonnie and Clyde. I checked.


These waffles may not be super crispy, but they are super tasty.
Tons of whole grains make them healthy and provide some crunchy texture, and the sucanat and molasses keep them from being overly-sweet. And once you put a juicy, roasted, caramelized nectarine or peach on top, BAM, flavor explosion in the mouth. Don’t look at me – you have been warned.


These gems make a perfect special morning meal for lazy weekends.Open up your windows, stream your favorite music, get flour all over your the kitchen floor and make these waffles. Is there anything better than that?
I topped mine with a little almond butter, a roasted nectarine and a drizzle of maple syrup. So, stinkin’, good. The lone remaining waffle in my freezer is currently calling my name. Definitely making these again this fall, and you know what? You should, too.


","If roasting stone fruit, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and slice fruit into thin wedges. Place on a baking sheet with 1 tsp of coconut or olive oil and toss with a touch of turbinado or granulated sugar (optional). Roast for 15-20 minutes or until soft and juicy. Cover with foil until serving. Set aside.For the waffles: In a large bowl, prepare flax egg by combining water and flaxseed and letting it rest for 5 minutes to achieve an ""eggy"" texture.Add the molasses, applesauce, oil, sucanat, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon and whisk. Add almond milk and stir once more.Next add flour and almond meal and whisk gently until just combined. Let batter rest while preheating your waffle iron, preferably to a high ""crispy"" setting.Once preheated, generously spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and spoon about 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the iron and cook according to manufacturer's instructions.Once done, place on a cooling rack briefly to let steam roll off and crisp up a bit. Then transfer to serving plates in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven. Serve warm with almond butter, roasted stone fruit and maple syrup, or whatever toppings you desire."
774,Best Vegan Biscuit Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Damn Vegan Biscuits

Before you suggest there’s no way vegan biscuits can taste just as good if not BETTER than regular biscuits, everyone I’ve fed these to agree that these are in fact LEGIT, amazing, fluffy, buttery biscuits.
As in, serve them to your 80-year old grandmother who’s been making biscuits for centuries and she wouldn’t know the difference.As in, slap some gravy on it and you’d think you died and gone to heaven.As in, fluffy, buttery, savory, biscuit perfection. It’s true.

I have tried making vegan biscuits once before and they did not meet my ridiculously high biscuit standards. They lacked that quintessential buttery flavor and fluffy texture that I so deeply adore. So this time, I read every single tip out there to fail-proof my biscuit making. And I’m happy to report that IT WORKED.

You need just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and these simple ingredients:
1. Unbleached all-purpose flour.
2. Non-dairy butter (such as Earth Balance).
3. Sea salt
4. Baking powder
5. Baking soda
6 Plain almond milk.
7. Lemon juice.
That’s it! And you’re well on your way to vegan biscuit perfection.

The commandments of biscuit making, as I’ve discovered, are:
1. Do not over-handle the dough.
2. Never use a rolling pin, fool.
3. Make sure yo’ butter is cold.
4. Baking powder and soda are a must for fluff.
5. Brush the tops with butter to achieve that crusty, buttery top.
6. Make a divot in the middle with your fingers to prevent them from rising in a “dome.”
7. A hot oven (450 degrees F / 232 C) is essential. Don’t ask questions.
8. Biscuits must touch while baking to help them rise properly.
I would include a # 9. but it’s simply to eat biscuits immediately. I shouldn’t have to tell you that. A BISCUIT FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN &gt; A BISCUIT REHEATED 3 DAYS LATER. Duh.

These little guys are PERFECT. Fluffy, moist, buttery, savory, perfect with jam, perfect for breakfast, perfect with anything. Hence the reason I’ve dubbed them THE BEST DAMN VEGAN BISCUIT.

And yes, I totally ate that whole damn biscuit (and them some).

","Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C), and add lemon juice to almond milk to make ""vegan buttermilk."" Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.Add cold butter and use fingers or a pastry cutter to combine the two until only small pieces remain and it looks like sand. Work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm.Make a well in the dry ingredients and, using a wooden spoon, stir gently while pouring in the almond milk mixture (vegan buttermilk) 1/4 cup at a time. You may not need all of it. Stir until just slightly combined – it will be sticky.Turn onto a lightly floured surface, dust the top with a bit of flour and then very gently turn the dough over on itself 5-6 times – hardly kneading.Form into a 1-inch thick disc, handling as little as possible.Use a 1-inch thick dough cutter or a similar-shape object with sharp edges (such as a cocktail shaker) and push straight down through the dough, then slightly twist. Repeat and place biscuits on a baking sheet in two rows, making sure they just touch – this will help them rise uniformly. Gently reform the dough and cut out one or two more biscuits – you should have 7-8 (as original recipe is written).Next brush the tops with a bit more of melted non-dairy butter and gently press a small divot in the center using two fingers. This will also help them rise evenly, so the middle won’t form a dome.Bake for 10-15 minutes or until fluffy and slightly golden brown. Serve immediately. Let remaining biscuits cool completely before storing them in an airtight container or bag."

Sometimes recipes come to me with no effort at all, like when someone gives you free cake on your birthday. Other times I have to chase them down like a disobedient child throwing a running hissy fit.
This recipe was of the former category. It hit me one day as I was jotting down website ideas. CREAMY THAI SLAW WITH BAKED WONTON CHIPS. Yep. THANKS RECIPE. You were simply meant to be.

It starts with chips. Baked chips, in fact. I do like the fried variety but will probably never make them myself because I don’t fry things. It scares me and I fear my arteries will see what I’m doing and seize up before I ever take a bite of said fried good.
I’ll eat a Pronto Pup at the state fair no problem. But you will likely NEVER see me dipping a battered dog in my own pot of oil. Plus, I’d probably burn myself and then John would ban me from the kitchen forever because I’m already prone enough to accidents in there.
Whoa, that escalated quickly. Bake to zee dip.

The slaw is so simple and fresh AND can be made dairy-free and peanut-free no problem.Sub mashed avocado for yogurt /sub almond or cashew butter for peanut.
SOLVED.

This slaw is so flavorful and crunchy! Slightly creamy with plenty of peanut flavor, sweetness, and tang from the lime. I’m kind of smitten with it, especially when served with baked wonton chips.
Tortilla chips, you’re cool and all but, you’re no wonton. Just sayin’.

Make this dip for a super fresh and easy appetizer for parties or gatherings. Make it before eating Pad Thai. Make it for a picnic and then take it on said picnic and eat it. Make it for a frand who loves Asian food.
Just make it. You get the point.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cut wonton strips (or egg roll wrappers) into small triangles.Spray chips lightly with olive or avocado oil, sprinkle with sea salt and arrange on a foil-lined baking sheet in a single layer making sure they don't touch.Bake for 6 minutes or until light golden brown. Set aside.While baking chips, whisk together the slaw dressing ingredients. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.Add veggies and toss. Serve with wonton chips immediately.

This week Billy has invited the food blogosphere to collectively post its latest and greatest popsicle recipes on the internetz for your benefit. In other words, there’s absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t have a popsicle in your fist by the end of this week.
Ya dig? Ya dig.

When I was dreaming up my Popsicle recipe I was reminded of the most refreshing frozen fruit experience I’ve ever had. It happened during the peak of summer two years ago.
It was hot, everyone was sweating, and my friend had scored a major load of fruit on sale at Sam’s. Since you can’t consume 8 pounds of blueberries by yourself in one week – I’ve tried – she decided to freeze the leftovers into little snack baggies and she gifted one to little old me.
I know, I have the cutest mom friends ever.

My little frozen fruit baggie beheld mandarin oranges, blueberries and bananas. So good, so simple. I remember the fruit being so refreshing, like a Popsicle, only all natural and totally healthy. I had to have it again.
So, this week I crafted my very own all-fruit Popsicles that require just four ingredients and NO Popsicle molds, because I don’t own one and I ain’t buyin’ one.Besides, when you have Dixie cups and wooden sticks, why do you need fancy pants Popsicle molds? To impress your neighbors? DON’T THINK SO.

Behold, the all-fruit, 4-ingredient Popsicle.
Peaches.
Oranges.
Blueberries.
All soaked in orange juice.
Oh mama.

Icy, simple, tart, sweet, soft in spots from the frozen fruit. I’m in Popsicle havana heaven. Wanna join?

Hooray!Find this and like 38 other amazing popsicle recipes over at Wit &amp; Vinegar this week! Thanks Billayyyyy.

By now you’ve probably guessed I’m a chocolate fiend. Something in my lady DNA craves it EVERY SINGLE DAY. Gotta have it. Sometimes that craving can be satisfied with a single square of dark chocolate, a bite of chocolate ice cream, or a healthified black bean brownie. BUT, some days I need a seriously decadent brownie to do the trick.
These are those brownies.


These brownies are seriously decadent and only take about 30 minutes from start to finish. The ingredients are basic, too:
dairy-free butter
sugar
flax eggs
cocoa powder
baking powder
vanilla
sea salt
flour
Thas it. Badda bing, badda boom. No black beans lurking here, promise (although it totally works, right!?)


The result is a brownie with that quintessential brownie crust on the top and sides and a soft and chocolatey chewy center.
I couldn’t stop at just one, I think I cleaned off half the batch in one day. Oops! But, I did manage to save the other half for a seriously decadent treat that I’ll share soon. Stay tuned!



","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and spray 7-8 standard-sized muffin tins with cooking spray (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Alternatively, fit each with a paper liner.Prepare flax eggs in a small bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.Place butter in a large mixing bowl and melt in the microwave. Then stir in the flax egg, sugar, vanilla, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder. Whisk to combine. Lastly, add the flour, then fold in any mix-ins - chocolate chips or walnuts would be excellent here.Scoop batter evenly into 7-8 muffin tins (as original recipe is written) until 3/4 full and bake on the middle rack for 22-26 minutes, or until the brownies start to pull away from the sides and they spring back slightly to the touch. Be careful not to overcook or they will get crumbly. Remove from oven and let rest in the tin for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a plate or cooling rack.Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for a couple days. Freeze for long-term storage."
778,Dairy-Free Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dairy-Free Chocolate Ice Cream

Calling all ice cream fiends! (myself included.)
You all know I love ice cream by now – exhibitsA, B, and C – but dairy doesn’t always do me favors. Yes, vegan ice creams do exist. However, coconut milk doesn’t always jibe with my system, either.
I was lamenting this fact to John recently when he suggested I try another recipe that’s dairy-free but without coconut. One milk that’s never done me wrong is almond milk, so I knew that would replace my half and half . And to keep it thick and creamy, I knew I would need a more traditional ice cream base.
To the drawing board I went.

This ice cream recipe is dairy-free, however, not vegan. I understand it’s not for everybody, but for those of us who are are OK with eating eggs but can’t have dairy, this is the recipe for you.
I started with an egg yolk and sugar base. Look how creamy it got!

Alton Brown taught me that I should look for the “ribbon effect” while whisking. I think I achieved that, eh?

Next I whisked the almond milk and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat, tempered the eggs, and mixed it all together with a touch of xanthan gum for extra thickness and a hint of vanilla for more complex flavor. Into the ice cream maker it went and I got super stoked when I sampled a bite and it tasted dreamy. After a few hours in the freezer, it somehow got even better.


This ice cream is thick, creamy, sweet, and satisfying, even though it doesn’t have that stereotypical “creaminess” that comes from full-fat whipping cream. That’s the kind of thickness that pains my stomach anyway, so I’m OK with a different kind of luxurious (as long as I’m getting my ice cream fix).
This first experiment was a total success, so I I can’t wait to try even more flavors and mix-ins.




","Add cocoa powder and half of the almond milk to saucepan over medium heat and whisk vigorously to combine. Add remaining almond milk and bring mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat after 2-3 minutes.To a large mixing bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk until they lighten in color. Gradually add the sugar in small increments while whisking vigorously so the two emulsify. You'll know you're done when it's thick and you achieve a ribboning effect - the mixture will form a ribbon when held from the whisk over the bowl (see picture).Next, scoop in roughly 1/3 cup of the warm chocolate-almond milk mixture and whisk to combine, in order to temper the eggs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add remaining liquid slowly and mix until completely combined.Add xanthan gum to the mixture through a sifter and mix once more. This is not necessary, but will help the ice cream thicken.Lastly, add the vanilla extract and stir once more. Then cover and refrigerate overnight or for at least 6-8 hours until completely cooled. Don't forget to chill your ice cream maker canister overnight as well.Once chilled, pour the mixture into the pre-chilled ice cream container and prepare according to manufacturer's instructions. It should take 20-30 minutes.Either consume immediately as ""soft serve"" consistency, or freeze, covered for 6-8 hours in a freezer-safe container to harden. Let set out for 10-15 minutes before scooping."

The only fruit I used to like eating when I was little was canned pears. I KNOW. Gross. I think it was a texture, sweetness thing…Anyway the LAST fruit I would ever eat as a kid was peaches. The fuzzy skin just set me off. But then, one summer I tried a peach milkshake and my life has never been the same.
All it took was covering it with ice cream to change my mind. Go figure.

These days I’m eating peaches in all kinds of things – crisps, green salads, fruit salads, and, more recently, smoothies.
This recipe features two ripe peaches as the star ingredient, frozen banana adds sweetness and texture, and orange juice adds a bit of tartness. Chia seeds make it gel up a bit and thicken, plus add a ton of health perks. And the oats provide tons o’ fiber, manganese, and what-not. Oy!

This smoothie is sweet, slightly tart, thick and creamy and super satisfying for breakfast or a snack. John and I split a batch recently with our morning coffee and both agreed it felt wholesome, just sweet enough and totally peach-y. Hooray!

","Add all ingredients to a blender and let set for 5-10 minutes so the oats and chia seeds can soak. Then blend until smooth.To thicken, add another quarter-half a frozen banana (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). To thin, add more almond milk or OJ.Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a touch of agave.Serve immediately."
780,Simple Deep Dish Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Deep Dish Pizza

Pie, pie, I made you a pie. A pie on the fly. Without any ryyyeee!
Sorry. It’s late and I really wanted to make you a poem. Somehow I wanted to fit in “It doesn’t have any butterrrrr” and “it’s deep dissshhh” but they didn’t really rhyme with fly, so they didn’t make the cut. You get the point though, you’re smart.

I have never really been a deep dish kind of girl. Thin crust is more my scene, obviously because I can justify more pieces and thus more toppings. Because let’s be honest, IT’S ALL ABOUT THE TOPPINGS, primarily the sauce. Am I right?
However, after recently getting the urge to go deep dish on you guys, I did a quick Facebook survey to see if you’d prefer something savory or sweet. To my surprise, the response was overwhelmingly savory. As in SALT over SUGAR. Whoa. So, as promised, here is a savory deep dish recipe and a sweet one is soon to follow for all my sweet tooths out there. SIT TIGHT ladies and gents.

Most deep dish pies involve some super buttery, complicated crust that I honestly don’t have the time or energy or desire to make.
I like my crust to taste like crust, not a buttery dinner roll. So I kept this one simple and stuck with my favorite pizza crust that I make almost weekly and keep on hand for impromptu pizza nights. I suggest you do the same. Clearly, it’s the only option.

Once you get past the complicated part of a deep dish pizza, namely the crust, it’s quite simple.
You get a round pan or cast iron, and rub it with olive oil.
Plop on the dough. Spread and form a 1-inch tall crust up the side.
Cheese.
Toppings.
Lots o’ sauce.
Mo cheese.
Boom. Bake. Boom. You got a deep dish pizza on your hands. (Only be careful because the skillet will be hot and you may burn yourself three times in the process of cutting it, not that I know that from experience or anything…)

This pie was SO SO good!
Despite being butter free it tasted absolutely decadent thanks to the layers of cheese, sauce and roasted veggies. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender and slightly doughy on the inside. And the veggies married with the sauce melted in between the cheese was a dream.
I could’ve eaten the whole thing, probably, except that my belly could only hold two small pieces. Deep dish is filling!

With a crust prepared ahead of time (or snagging a quality store-bought) this pie comes together in about 45 minutes. It’s such a simple and fairly healthy lunch or dinner option that only requires a handful of staple ingredients. I know I said I liked thin crust before, but….things are about to get all deep dish up in here. I’m in love!

","If roasting veggies, preheat oven to broil, toss veggies in olive oil on a baking sheet, and broil for 4-6 minutes on the top rack (low/medium broil), tossing once for even cooking. Remove from oven and set aside.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C).Next, coat a cast iron or round baking dish with extra virgin olive oil and run a garlic clove around for seasoning. Plop your dough down into the pan and push it up around the sides about 1 to 1.5 inches. Let rest for a few minutes while preparing the rest of your toppings.First sprinkle in 1/2 of mozzarella cheese, then add veggies, then sauce. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese, italian seasonings (dried basil, oregano, thyme, red pepper, etc.) and grated parmesan cheese.Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese and sauce are bubbly. Let rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting, then serve immediately."
781,Gluten-Free Strawberry Nectarine Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Strawberry Nectarine Crisp

I have extremely high standards for crisps. They must contain butter and brown sugar. They must be oaty. They must have a 2:1 fruit to crisp ratio (because I’m so healthy, clearly). And they must pair well with vanilla ice cream – non-negotiable.
Because like my new favorite summer catch phrase goes, if there’s no vanilla ice cream, it’s like, “What’s the point?”

This crisp pairs two of my favorite summer fruits: strawberries and nectarines. And it’s topped with a seriously nutty, not-too-sweet gluten-free crisp that is worthy of the dessert gods. Trust.
The recipe was inspired by one found in my new favorite book, “Bread and Wine” by Shauna Niequist.Shauna grew up eating hand-picked blueberry crisp and vanilla ice cream with her family most Sunday evenings, and it’s a tradition she now carries on with her own family. That’s a pretty OK Sunday tradition, if you ask me. Perhaps we should institute that in our household, at least as long as nectarines are dirt cheap and as sweet as candy.

I was shocked out how much I LOVED this flour-free version. I expected there to be a lack of cohesiveness and crumble, but that was certainly not the case. It was borderline perfection.
The pecans were THEE perfect nut to help marry the flavors together, and the almond meal acted as the wholesome, hearty binder.


Nectarines and strawberries became best friends in my bowl, complementing each other perfectly. And the moment the vanilla ice cream started to melt against the heat of the crisp was the moment I could’ve wept and died a happy woman. No exaggeration.
Yes, I could get lost in a bowl of this crisp daily. Maybe that’s why I’ve already made it twice in a matter of 5 days. Oops.

If you aren’t a big strawberry or nectarine fan, simply sub in your favorite summer fruit.
As the original recipe noted, blueberries are kind of perfect here. I’d also like to try this recipe with all peaches, a mixture of nectarines and blueberries, and perhaps a triple-berry version of some kind. I might even splurge and make John’s half-joking, half-serious request of “Oops, all crisp.”
Either way, you can’t go wrong. This has officially become my new go-to crisp and I hope it becomes yours, too. Cheers!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and butter an 8x8 (or similar size) baking dish (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add fruit directly to the dish as you chop it and spread until flat.To a mixing bowl add crisp ingredients and, using your hands, mix until all of the butter is evenly distributed.Add to the top of the fruit in an even layer.Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the fruit is bubbling and the top is crisp and golden."
782,5-Ingredient Spanish Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Spanish Sangria

Let’s talk sangria. The good and the bad. Shall we?
To me, sangria should be slightly sweet, plenty fruity, and always red. But then again, I’m probably a sangria snob just like I’m a coffee and anice cream snob. So clearly I’m not the sangria authority of the universe. However, I do know good sangria when I try it, and this is that.

While on vacation in Bali last month, we splurged one lunch and ordered a pitcher of sangria for two. It was fun to try and decipher what all of the flavors and ingredients were, and once we returned home, we wanted to attempt to recreate all of our favorite aspects of the restaurant’s version in our own recipe. It starts with fruit and lots of it.


Pineapple, pear, and orange. Aren’t they the best? They make the perfect sweet and tangy fruit combo to absorb all of that red wine goodness.
Speaking of red wines, we went with aSpanish tempranillobecause we’ve been digging wines from Spain lately. It made the perfect not-too-dry, not-overly-sweet wine for the base of this drink.


To sweeten things just a little, we added orange juice, but this is entirely optional if you prefer dry over sweet. This is the beauty of sangria: so customizable.

We were so happy with how this turned out! Smooth with just a little bit of spice from the tempranillo and TONS of fruit to eat with a spoon at the bottom of each glass.
This makes a lovely beverage for parties featuring Mexican food. But really, it’d be good for any occasion and pairing. Enjoy!

",Slice fruit and drop into a large pitcher.Add orange juice and wine and stir.Refrigerate until serving - 4-6 hours would be ideal so the flavors can mingle. Drink within 1-2 days.
783,Vegan Snickers Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Snickers Ice Cream

Three words: Snickers Ice Cream. Happy Birthday to me!

Yes, it’s true. Yesterday was my 27th birthday and I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate than with ice cream – my all-time favorite food group.
Don’t worry. I haven’t sold my soul to the egg and dairy devils just yet. I’ve kept this recipe vegan and as simple as possible. That way, I can indulge with half the guilt and share it with all of you. Best community birthday present ever.

Speaking of best birthday present ever, I WON THIS CUISINART ICE CREAM MAKER in theFoodess’s giveaway! I had a suspiciously good feeling about it when I entered my name in the drawing and was absolutely floored when I received an e-mail from Jennifer notifying me I’d won!
I kicked, I screamed, I squealed. And then I responded with gratitude and my physical address. Once it arrived it was on. I wasted no time breaking it in with this luscious vegan snickers ice cream. I hope I’m doing Jennifer proud.

This ice cream is simple.
Coconut milk.
Raw sugar.
Vegan caramel sauce.
Peanuts.
Bittersweet chocolate curls.
(And a vegan snickers bar for good measure)
That’s it! And it’s so rich and satisfying that I’d almost rather it thanthe actual candy bar. Or on second thought, maybe I’ll have both. Yeah, it’s my birthday so I’ll definitely be having both. Hooray!

The best part about this ice cream, besides it requiring only easy to findingredients, is that it’s fairly hands off. Once you combine your base and let it cool, you let your ice cream maker do the work.
You can make this without an ice cream maker, but it will likely affect the texture, making it icier and denser than it would be otherwise. But if it’s the flavor you’re going for anyways it doesn’t really matter. The bottom line is: You need to have this flavor combo in your mouth, STAT. Get to churning!


","Add coconut milk to a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stir and bring to a simmer. Continue whisking for 1-2 minutes.Remove mixture from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and xanthan gum. Whisk to combine.Transfer to a glass bowl and refrigerate until cooled. I left mine in the refrigerator for 6-8 hours and covered it with plastic wrap once it was no longer steaming hot.Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, transfer into the pre-chilled bowl of your ice cream machine and mix according to manufacturer’s instructions.Once the ice cream is nearly done add half of the caramel, chocolate flecks and peanuts. To make my chocolate curls I melted my chocolate first, let it cool and then ran a scraper over it to make the pieces more edible. This, however, isn't necessary.When the ice cream machine stops, transfer to a freezer-safe container and sprinkle in the rest of the chocolate flecks, peanuts and caramel in layers, swirling with a knife to slightly incorporate. I also added in a Vegan Snickers Bar, but this is also optional.At this point you can either consume it soft, or pop it in the freezer to harden. It should keep fresh for about a week. Thaw for 10-15 minutes before serving."
784,Vegan Snickers Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Snickers Bars

When I was little I used to love accompanying my mom to the grocery store. She was a gentle shopper, rarely in a hurry and always willing to search around for good deals to save us a little extra money. I’d be lying if I said this is why I loved trips to the store, besides the fact that I just loved being with her. But I most looked forward to the end of our trip when we’d finally lassoed our goods and meandered over to the check out line. That was where the Snickers bars were, right at eye level with 3-foot me. And my mom always let me have one, not necessarily because she was a softie (though she was), but because I always asked and I was quite persistent. I hope any future mini-me’s are a little less aggressive.
Either way, my sweet tooth was always rewarded with a big hunk of chewy, peanut-y caramel-y goodness and my chocolate-loving palate couldn’t have been more pleased. Things haven’t changed much since then, only my palate is a touch more refined.

These days I’m into healthier treats, for the sake of my teeth and my adversity to processed goods. So when considering how to veganize my all-time favorite candy bar and keep it simple, I had to get a little creative. So I started with the “nougat.”

At first glance this seems like a overly-simplified way to make a nougat for a candy bar, but trust me, it works. The real stars of this bar are the vegan caramel, peanuts and chocolate anyway – this simply adds a healthier, not-too-sweet base for all of the goods to cling to. It just happens to only require 2 ingredients. Hello simplicity.

The vegan caramel sauce came next, and after three trials I got it right. I simply modified my 4-ingredient bourbon caramel sauce to utilize full fat coconut milk in place of whipping cream. And the result was perfection: creamy, rich caramel sauce with no dairy and just 4 ingredients.


The rest was easy.
Layer the nougat with caramel sauce and peanuts.
Freeze.
Dip the bars in dark chocolate and brush to coat.
Freeze.
Dee-vour.

How close are these bars to the real thing? Pretty darn close. The only real difference is the denser texture than the original, but other than that all of the flavors are spot on! I was so pleased, and so were my friends, who gladly helped me polish them off in a matter of 24 hours.
Stick around ’til Thursday (the day after my TWENTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY – oh my) to see what else I put these beauties into. I’ll give you a hint: it rhymes with shmyce dream, my favorite food group.

","Pulse dates in a food processor until only small bits remain.Add walnuts and pulse until thoroughly mixed and a ""dough"" is formed.Transfer dough to a small loaf pan lined with parchment paper or plastic wrap and press into a square about 1/4 inch thick. Once sliced, the dough should yield 8 small snickers bars - I only used half the space in my loaf pan to achieve the proper thickness.Pop dough in the freezer to set for 5 minutes.Remove from freezer and transfer to a cookie sheet. Carefully slice into 8 even rectangles.Top with caramel sauce and add peanuts. Pop back in freezer for 15 minutes to harden.Ten minutes into freezing, melt the chocolate in a shallow bowl. When set, remove bars from freezer and carefully dip each one into the chocolate and scrape off excess with a rubber spatula. Then using a spoon, drizzle a generous amount of chocolate on top of each bar and use your finger or a small pastry brush to coat the bars with chocolate. You will likely have leftover chocolate.Place bars on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap or parchment and place back in freezer to set for at least 10 minutes. Store in the freezer or fridge to keep fresh until serving."
785,Vegan Carrot Coconut Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Carrot Coconut Pancakes

Carrot cake = perfection
Coconut cake = the bees knees
Carrot + coconut pancakes = pancake heaven.
You follow?

These pancakes were inspired by my love for both carrot cake and coconut.
I have always loved the flavor of coconut – not always the texture – and find it altogether pleasing and sweet. And if there is a slice of carrot cake around I will NEVER turn it down. I mean never. Even if 5 minutes before I was just complaining about how miserably full I was I would still eat a giant slice of sweet carrot cake with mounds of cream cheese frosting. Just thinking about it makes me hungry, and I just had a snack. You do the math.

But since I can’t realistically justify a slice of carrot cake for breakfast every day, I’ll turn instead to infusing those flavors into a stack of flap jacks. Good enough for me.

What you need to know about these pancakes:
They require just 20 minutes, 10 ingredients and 1 mixing bowl.
They’re vegan andhave a limited amount of sugar.
They have loads of fresh shredded carrot.
They have a subtle coconut flavor and light and fluffy texture.
They’re perfect with walnuts, shredded coconut and hot maple syrup.
They’re light enough for an everyday breakfast and special enough for a weekend brunch.
Perfect? I think so.


These cakes are light and fluffy just like they look, and not overly sweet thanks to a limited amount of sugar. The carrot isn’t overwhelming nor is the coconut, but the two seem to pair together perfectly to give it the perfect amount of heartiness and decadence. Although filling, they won’t leave you feeling like you ate an entire loaf of bread. I kind of hate it when that happens.

Though a cream cheese frosting of some sort would be fabulous, that wouldn’t be very vegan of us, now wouldn’t it? So maple syrup it is. Trust me, you won’t regret it.

","Add flour, sugar, baking powder, sea salt, and shredded coconut in a large bowl and whisk to combine.Pour non-dairy milk into a large liquid measuring cup. Add melted butter and vanilla and whisk to combine. Add wet to dry and stir.Stir in carrot and let batter rest for 5 minutes while preheating skillet to medium heat.Once skillet is hot, lightly grease the surface with non-stick spray or non-dairy butter and spoon on 1/4 cup measurements of batter; there should be 9 cakes (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Top each pancake with a sprinkle of crushed walnuts and flip when bubbles appear and the edges look slightly dry.Cook for another couple of minutes on the other side. Keep warm in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven until all pancakes are cooked.Serve with non-dairy butter, shredded coconut and warm maple syrup."
786,Gluten Free Green Tea Crepes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Green Tea Crepes &amp; White Chocolate-Coconut Filling

You guys, these crepes are a game changer. G-A-M-E changer. Sweet, gluten-free, and flavored with green tea! You’re gonna want to eat 12 of these STAT.

I haven’t always been a crepe lover; pancakes are more my thing. But these may be changing my mind…
They’re perfectly light and spongy with just a hint of vanilla-infused green tea flavor. And they’re so simple to make. You just drop 7 ingredients into a blender, whirl, and presto cook-o – you’re done! And then, wait till you see what we put inside…


For the filling I wanted to make a white chocolate coconut whipped frosting after seeing Oh She Glows’ AMAZING 2-ingredient chocolate frosting. I mean, whoa. I employed the same method but I think my can of coconut milk was a dud. If only we could all have that Ladycakefinesse.
But, even though it didn’t quite turn out “whipped” like I hoped, it was still SO so good inside the crepes, especially with a few blueberries sprinkled on top.

Green tea crepes + coconut white chocolate filling + blueberries + STRAWBERRY sauce = Magic in the mouth.

I whipped this batch up one recent morning with the help of a friend, we scarfed them down in sheer delight, muttering “mmmmm’s” and “aaahhhhh’s” between every bite. They made an irresistible light breakfast and we both agreed would be the perfect item to serve at a girls-only brunch affair. Oh my.
These may not be dairy-free, but they are gluten-free and considerably light. Plus, the ingredients list is so simple (hello, 7 ingredients or less).

I incorporated green tea because I love the taste andit’s so healthyto consume. But if you don’t have green tea powder simply omit it or sub it with another flavor of your choice. I found that the white chocolate filling, blueberries and strawberry sauce provided plenty of flavor on their own.

The best part about these crepes is you really can’t tell they’re gluten-free! The texture is spot on.
Bonus: they reheat incredibly well the next day. I was shocked at how good my leftovers were, especially since gluten-free items can be a bit off when reheated. Not the case here. You really can’t go wrong with these crepes! What are you waiting for? Get to it!

","Place all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. In the meantime, heat a small non-stick skillet over low heat.Once preheated, spray with non-stick spray and pour enough batter in to coat the bottom, twirling the batter around to evenly coat the pan.

Then flip carefully by loosening the edges with a butter knife and flipping it over in one swift movement.Cook for another minute or so on the other side and then transfer to a serving plate. Place sheets of wax paper between crepes to keep fresh.

787,Classic Miso Soup with Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"15-Minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu

Sushi – I think it’s one of my love languages.
Sticky rice, spicy salmon, fresh vegetables, fiery wasabi, and salty soy sauce. And don’t even get me started on pickled ginger. Wasabi + soy + ginger = flavor bomb. I can barely handle it. Needless to say, John and I have put sushi on heavy rotation in our eating out options.

One of my favorite parts of going out for sushi is miso soup.
It’s so warm and comforting and savory, with perfect little bites of tofu and seaweed in every scoop. Up until now I’ve reserved miso for times when we go out to eat. But when I was feeling a little under the weather recently, miso sounded soooo good to my achy stomach. That, along with a strong sushi craving, inspired me to create some of my own.

Most miso is made with 4 main ingredients: water, miso (fermented soy bean paste), tofu, and seaweed of some form.
Miso can be found in the refrigerated section of some grocery stores and nearly all Asian markets. It may seem like an obscure ingredient to buy just for soup, but it’s affordable, incredibly healthy and can be used in many other recipes like soups, salad dressings, marinades, and many Asian-inspired dishes. So, I found it a worthy addition to my pantry.

I wanted to keep my miso classic and simple, but with a bit more emphasis on the greens. So I added some green chard and lots of green onion to the mix and couldn’t have been more pleased with the result.
This soup is bursting with miso flavor and delivers the perfect amount of tofu and seaweed in each bite. And for veggie lovers like me, there’s more than a full serving of greens in each bowl. Be still my heart.

Though I think I’ll leave sushi to the experts, I see plenty of miso soup in our future. Next time I think I may go 101 cookbooks on the dang thing and add in some soba noodles. Oh lordy.

","Place water in a medium sauce pan and bring to a low simmer.Add nori and simmer for 5-7 minutes.In the meantime, place miso (starting with lesser end of range) into a small bowl, add a little hot water and whisk until smooth. This will ensure it doesn’t clump. Set aside.Add green chard, green onion, and tofu to the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Then remove from heat, add miso mixture, and stir to combine. Taste and add more miso or a pinch of sea salt if desired. Serve warm. Best when fresh."

How does one remember their earliest memory of a s’more? This, I do not know. But what I do know is that it surely was love at first bite for s’mores and me.
Since then I’ve been consuming them and dreaming up recipes featuring this dreamy graham-choco-mallow combination. I mean, who doesn’t love a s’more, besides John? But he doesn’t count because he also doesn’t like brownies. I KNOW. Who did I marry? WHO?!


These pancakes are WOW, just WOW. I’ll get to the recipe in a minute but will first fully admit that I swiped the top pancake off the stack and consumed it in about 3 bites flat after I was done taking photos. I mean, dang! So delicious.


As always this recipe is simple.
It requires 10 ingredients and 1 bowl.
Takes about 20 minutes from start to finish.
Is vegan and contains whole wheat flour.
Tastes JUST like a s’more, only in pancake form.
Would be perfect for kiddos, adults, foodies and non-foodies alike.
The only requirement for liking these pancakes is that you must like s’mores. Everybody on board? Good, let’s proceed.


The flavor of these cakes is AMAZING. Perfectly sweet with studs of melty chocolate and graham cracker throughout, and a crispy gooey marshmallow top. Not to mention, they have a light, cakey texture that makes the perfect vehicle for all of that chocolaty-mallow goodness.
Convinced yet? Seriously, go make these pancakes!

789,Vegan Dark Chocolate Cherry Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cherry Dark Chocolate Chip Muffins

Can we just talk for a moment about how delicious cherries are right now? They are a more expensive fruit at our markets in Kansas but once I eyed them and snagged a sample to test for ripeness/flavor, I knew it was on. To the kitchen I went, with chocolate and cherries in hand.


Chocolate-cherry muffins, that are vegan! Oh boy. I know chocolate-covered cherries are a thing – my mom LOVES them – but I’ve always thought they were kinda gross. Something about the slimy texture, weird flavor. BUT, when the cherries are fresh and the chocolate is dark and chopped in thick chunks, you know I’m all about it.


These muffins are so simple to throw together, requiring a limited number of ingredients and just one mixing bowl. Plus, they’re considerably healthy as far as muffins go.
Whole wheat pastry flour mixed with oat flour provides a hearty, whole-grain base; a touch of brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness; dark chocolate delivers plenty of antioxidants; and cherries provide loads of fiber, vitamin C and cancer-fighting flavonoids. Yep and yep.
Also, did I mention they’re delicious?


These muffins may be vegan but they don’t lack in flavor or texture. The’re cakey and light with a sweet, nutty flavor from the brown sugar and almond extract. The cherries are abundant and bursting with flavor, and the chocolate peeks through to give just the touch of decadence you crave.

Breakfast, dessert, snack time, we’ve got you covered with this one simple treat. Enjoy!

790,Corn and Cotija Cheese Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Summer Corn and Cotija Cheese Dip

Oh mah gosh. This dip? Where do I even start…
The star of this dip is beautiful yellow corn, which is perfect for summer. Corn is officially my muse at the moment.

Since making my creamy Brussels Sprout and Shallot dip last fall, I have been kind of smitten with the idea of mixing cheesy things with vegetable things in a cast iron skillet. That’s really how this dip came to be.

The ingredients are simple, as always: fresh corn, shallot, garlic, light cream cheese, sour cream (or Greek yogurt) and Mexican cotija cheese. From start to finish this dip takes about 30 minutes and requires just 1 bowl and a baking dish. Holy cow, this shouldn’t be that easy BUT IT IS.

How does it taste?
Creamy, cheesy, salty, and perfect on a tortilla chip, but somehow still light and summery. In other words, it is perfect.
We took this batch straight over to our friends’ house for dinner one night last week and I knew they would like it so much that I planned to leave all the leftovers. A few chip-fuls in and I knew I was right. In fact, it was nearly empty by the time we left.
Try this dip! We know you’ll love it. And if you do, share your picture with us on Instagram! We love to see how our recipes turn out in your kitchen. Then, we can be like Internet besties. How rad is that?

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Heat a cast iron or oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 of the olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written), and the shallot and garlic. Stir constantly to prevent burning.Add corn, sea salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 5 minutes until shallots appear softened and the corn is slightly darker in color. Then remove from heat.In a large bowl mix together sour cream, cream cheese, and cotija and stir. Add corn mixture to the bowl and stir until well combined.Use remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written) to lightly grease the cast iron so the dip doesn’t stick. Spoon dip back into the skillet and bake for 11-13 minutes or until hot and bubbly.Serve with veggies, tortilla chips, crackers or baguette bread. Tortilla chips were my favorite."
791,Mini Sopapilla Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mini Sopapilla Pancakes

You guys, get ready to party. Sopapilla style.

All of the sudden I had this idea to make mini cinnamon pancakes, and decided to execute last weekend. Pancakes + cinnamon = happiness, I was convinced.
I wanted to make them vegan, of course, and although I was half-tempted to make them gluten free, I was really really in the mood for something familiar, and fluffy. So out the window that idea went. I can only do so much accommodating in the pancake department. Breakfast is serious business, after all.

These cakes are dreamy. The batter is thick and light and they cook up all soft and fluffy, golden brown, and bursting with cinnamon aroma.
I was keeping my stack warm in the oven while the rest finished cooking and each time I opened the door I got hit with an intense cinnamon donut scent – just like a sopapilla! That’s when it dawned on me: These are no ordinary cinnamon pancakes, they are fluffy and sweet and doughy just like a sopapilla, begging to be doused in honey.
So that’s what I did. I don’t argue with the breakfast gods when they make such a clear request.


These pancakes are PHENOMENAL. I know I could say this every time I make pancakes, but these are seriously some of my favorite to date!
They’d be great for entertaining or brunch as they’re easy for guests to snag one or two of and pair with something more substantial. They’d also be fun for kids because they’re minis + totally ideal for eating with your hands. Not that I tried or anything…
But really, if it’s just you and you’re dying for a sopapilla but don’t want to fry anything, this will satisfy that craving. There’s practically no Mexican dessert desire that these little super fluffy cinnamon pancakes doused with butter + honey can’t fulfill.


What you need to know about these pancakes is they:
Aresuper easy to make.
Take less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
Require 1 bowl, 1 measuring cup + a whisk.
Have 8 ingredients.
Taste just like a sopapilla.
Are light, fluffy, and bursting with cinnamon flavor.
Pair perfectly with a hot cup of coffee.
What more do you need to know? Get to pancaking!



Note: These cakes are vegan friendly if you top with maple syrup instead of honey.
","Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl.Measure out milk in a large liquid measuring cup. Then add vanilla and melted butter and whisk.Add wet to dry and gently, slowly whisk until just combined. Small lumps are fine - don't overmix.Let set for 5 minutes while you preheat your griddle to medium-low heat. You want it warm but not screaming hot - definitely on the low-side of medium.Once hot scoop scant 1/4 cup measurements onto a griddle or pan lightly greased with non-stick spray. Should make ~10 pancakes (as original recipe is written). Flip when bubbles appear on top - 2-3 minutes. Cook for another 2 more minutes on the other side.Place on a large plate and keep warm in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven until ready for serving.Top with butter, cinnamon sugar, and a drizzle of warm maple syrup or honey. I went with honey because it's what I had on hand + it made it like a true sopapilla experience. But if vegan, agave or maple syrup will do fine.Store leftovers in an airtight container or bag in the fridge to keep fresh, or the freezer for longterm storage. However, these are best when fresh."

One of the best memories I’ve shared with my in-laws so far is sitting elbow-to-elbow around a crowded couch in their basement, soda cans and napkins sprawled all over the coffee table, everyone eating pizza. All 9 of us.
Yes, 9.
John has six siblings and he’s the oldest, and every time we get together with his family we joke that it’s like chasing a tornado. You don’t know where it’s headed and how long it will stay and everyone seems to be pulling to go their own direction at every turn. Thankfully they’re not the destructive tornado type, more the “come in make things a little messy and love on you” type. The kind I prefer.

One thing John’s family does very well is pizza. One of the best times I recall was on one of the kids’ birthdays. The birthday boy got to decide what was for lunch and he picked pizza – smart kid.
In true Shultz style we all made our own personal pans since the chances of 9 hungry bellies agreeing on one flavor was slim. I’m OK with that. I’m a “heavy on the sauce, pile on the veggies, light on the cheese” type. John loves pepperoni, lots of it. Abby prefers more adventurous types like BBQ chicken, and the other half of the group seems to be all about the cheese.
Clearly, personal pans were the best option.

So we all crowded into the kitchen, narrowly missing each other at each turn, flour covering the counters, each one pulverizing his or her own plot of dough. Sauce and spoons left red little dots everywhere and stray cheese and toppings looked like edible confetti exploded all over the floor.
Twenty minutes later our (very) personalized pizzas were out of the oven, onto plates and under the weight of swiftly-moving knifes and forks working feverishly to cut fresh slices before the cheese lost its elastic stretch.
Andy Griffith was on, eyes glued to the screen when not shoveling in steamy bites of pepperoni and veggies and crust. Amidst the chaos I couldn’t help but look around and feel thankful that I was a part of this little group, this family.
A lot of people complain about their in-laws, and maybe rightfully so, but I kind of have it good. Any family that does personal pan pizzas and soda on a Sunday afternoon is the kind of family for me.

Typically I prefer a very standard veggie pizza, but after buying some goat cheese and flat breads for another recipe I couldn’t help but do a little experimenting.
Crispy thin flatbreads smeared with creamy, tangy goat cheese and topped with piles of sweet caramelized onions. As is this pizza is stellar, but add a little balsamic drizzle and we achieve perfection. Don’t even get me started on when we add fresh basil…

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven. If using a pizza stone, place the stone in the oven as it preheats.Sauté onion in butter or olive oil over medium heat until soft, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep in the moisture if they begin to look dry – add a splash or two of water if they’re getting too brown. Set aside once cooked.Once oven is preheated, brush flatbread with olive oil and place on the pizza stone or a baking sheet and “pre-bake” to crisp for about 5 minutes.In the meantime, spoon goat cheese into a bowl and add a splash of milk or water to thin so it’s spreadable. Whisk until smooth.Remove flatbread from oven and spread with goat cheese and top with onions – I used all of the onions but use less and reserve the leftovers if you prefer.Place back in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges appear crisp and the onions and goat cheese have warmed through.Slice and serve with desired toppings. I opted for a balsamic reduction and fresh basil."
793,Noodle-Free Pad Thai | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Noodle-Free Tofu Pad Thai

We’ve been fans of pad Thai for a long time around here. Before I tried my hand at any homemade versions, we got some form of pad Thai for takeout most weeks when we were newlyweds.
One particular evening when John was still the manager at our apartment building in downtown Portland, we got spicy tofu pad Thai and veggie spring rolls and ate it out of brown boxes with chopsticks on the floor of a vacant suite on the top floor of our building. With sniffling noses and full bellies we looked out over downtown through the 20-foot windows and felt terribly blessed by the way our lives were turning out, even if just for shelter, marriage, and Thai takeout.

Thankfully I started experimenting with pad Thai about a year into our marriage mostly to save money and customize to our preferences. Since then I’ve mastered our favorite version – chicken or tofu, lots of fresh carrots for garnish, tons of peanut sauce and a ridiculous amount of sriracha.
John loves how filling and flavorful it is, and how it involves boatloads of peanut sauce on every bite. I like that it has lots of veggies, a sweet, savory, spicy marriage of flavors, and that it’s fairly healthy despite tasting completely indulgent.
One thing we don’t like about pad Thai, however, is that it requires a million dishes and always makes our kitchen look like a complete disaster by the time I’m finished cooking. This version is an attempt to remedy that problem be requiring fewer dishes, and incorporate even more veggies into the mix, completely nixing the need for noodles altogether.
And with that, I present you with noodle-free pad Thai.

This pad Thai uses thinly grated carrots and zucchini in place of traditional rice noodles, dressed in a simple savory-sweet marinade reminiscent of the traditional pad Thai sauce. Then I add fresh tofu, peanut sauce, sriracha, cilantro, and fresh peanuts.
The result is a fresher, less messy version that takes about 20 minutes to prepare and doesn’t require any heat, making it summertime approved.

If you’re not a tofu fan, sub chicken or just add more peanuts. If you’re peanut adverse, sub toasted almonds and almond butter for the peanut butter and crushed peanuts. And to make this super quick, omit the dressing altogether and simply slather with peanut sauce. You can never go wrong with more peanut sauce.

","Whisk dressing ingredients together and taste to adjust seasonings.Add carrots and zucchini and toss to combine. Let marinade for 5 minutes. Then add tofu and toss again.Divide between two serving plates (as original recipe is written) and top with peanut sauce, fresh cilantro, sriracha, and crushed peanuts."
794,2-Layer No-Bake Peanut Butter Brownie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"2-Layer No-Bake Peanut Butter Brownie Bars

Oh, hey there. Today I have one of my very favorite addictions for you – chocolate &amp; peanut butter. Is there anything better?

Ever since making my “raw” brownies + peanut butter pattie dough, I couldn’t help but wonder how the two would pair together. Just as I suspected, they make one seriously sweet couple. I mean look at ’em. Look at ’em, would ya?!
How could you go wrong when you start with a base that looks like this?!

This recipe, so simple. And so quick!
First make your brownie layer with 5 ingredients, then your PB layer with 4 ingredients. Smash one on top of the other, just like when you were a kid making mud pies in your backyard (am I the only one?) Next thing you know, bam! You have a 2-layer no-bake PB-chocolate dream on your hands.
I could cozy up next to these bars alllll night. Don’t even get me started on if they were crumbled over ice cream. Whoa mama.

The chocolate layer complements the peanut butter layer perfectly and they remain tender, soft and not too sweet. These make a lovely dessert, mid-afternoon snack or post-workout bite. I kept mine in the freezer by preference and nibbled on corners throughout the day. They go perfect alongside ice cold almond milk. Good thing we had new friends move into the neighborhood to share with or I’d have eaten these all by myself!
Serious yum.

","To make the brownie layer, pulse dates in the food processor until small bits remain. Remove from processor and set aside in a small bowl. Add walnuts, almonds, chocolate chips and cocoa powder in the processor and pulse until well combined. Then, while the processor is running, drop small bits of the dates in until a dough is formed. It should begin to ball up at some point. If it remains too dry, add a couple more whole (pitted) dates until a dough is achieved.Press into an 8×8 pan (or one of similar size // adjust if altering batch size) lined with parchment or plastic wrap. This makes it easier to lift out and cut.Press until flat using your hands or a spatula. Pop in the freezer.To make peanut butter layer, process dates until small bits remain. Remove and set aside in a bowl. Then add raw almonds and peanuts and pulse until small bits remain. Add back in peanut butter and the dates and process until well combined. Press on top of brownie layer until smooth. Using plastic wrap or parchment can help get it completely flat.Freeze for at least 15 minutes before removing from pan and cutting. Cut into about 20 squares (I cut mine too big and would prefer smaller bites // adjust if altering batch size). Store in an airtight container to keep fresh. I keep mine in the freezer so they stay fresh for weeks."
795,Watermelon Lime Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Watermelon Lime Margaritas

John and I have grown quite fond of homemade margaritas over the years. It’s no surprise considering we make Mexican food for dinner more often than we do laundry – and that’s saying a lot since we’re kind of clean freaks – and margaritas always seem to be our accompanying beverage of choice. Though we’ve mostly stuck to more traditional flavors, I couldn’t shake the idea of making a watermelon margarita this summer, so off to the porch we went to experiment one recent evening.
As it always happens, the one time you’re doing something somewhat “risque” like making cocktails on your front porch, someone notices. The neighbor’s grandkids just happened to be in town for a visit and decided to go off-season “trick or treating” for healthy snacks, and ended up on our porch…with the liquor. Us, large bottles of tequila and triple sec, and two innocent kids. Quick, hide the evidence!

John quickly hid the bottles before they could ask, “Hey Mr., what’s that?!” as I distracted them by asking the name of their dog. For the record, I don’t remember the name of the dog, but I did successfully divert their attention from the margarita magician shuffling bottles behind his curtain. Potentially awkward disaster averted. Phew.


I happily got the kids a banana almond meal muffin so they wouldn’t go away empty handed, and once they left we got back to business.
I’d already made watermelon juice and ice cubes earlier that day and all that was left for John to do was use his magic touch to combine the remaining ingredients: Tequila, triple sec and lime juice. Do yo’ thing, boy.

This recipe is super easy to throw together and simply perfect for summer gatherings.
We enjoyed generous sips of ours on the porch after dinner. The weather’s been so gorgeous here in Kansas that we can’t seem to get enough of evenings and afternoons spent outside. Good thing there’s things like fresh watermelon lime margaritas in the world to come to the rescue and cool us down.

Besides requiring little ingredients and time, these margaritas are extremely customizable.
If you don’t have watermelon juice, just throw your watermelon cubes in the blender with lime juice and make a frozen blended margarita.
If you don’t have watermelon cubes, sub regular ice cubes – there will still be plenty of flavor from the watermelon juice. You can also omit the alcohol altogether to make these virgin and I bet they’d still be delicious. Cheers to the perfect drink for summer!


","To make watermelon juice, scoop half a small watermelon into a blender and puree until well blended. Then strain through a fine mesh strainer and place juice in a jar. Refrigerate until ready for use.To make watermelon ice cubes, cube the other half of the watermelon into ice cube-sized pieces and place on a baking sheet. Make sure they're not touching of they'll stick together. Freeze for 4-5 hours or overnight or until very firm.To make margaritas, add watermelon juice, lime juice, tequila, and triple sec to a cocktail shaker or pitcher and shake vigorously or stir.Next, run the quarter of a lime around two serving glasses and then dip in margarita salt. Fill 3/4 of the way full with watermelon ice cubes (or regular ice cubes if preferred).Divide the margarita between glasses (2 as original recipe is written) and serve immediately. Garnish with an additional lime wedge."
796,Gluten-Free Pizza Crust | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Gluten-Free Pizza Crust + Sauce

This time last summer our friend Laura found out she had food allergies. Not the kind that can be cured with an enzyme pill or avoidance of cheese. The kind that require eliminating half your diet. She was heartbroken for it and we were, too. We ate together all the time and the allergies imparted all kinds of complications. But after rallying our spirits we ventured to explore new and better recipes together, namely ones free of gluten since it seemed to be the main culprit in her diet.
Laura’s family has always had homemade pizza on Sunday nights – a tradition she loved then resented after she couldn’t participate. She and I both searched for gluten-free crust alternatives but always ended up with doughy, bean-flavored, less-than-memorable results. Then Laura had the brilliant idea to try her mom’s traditional crust recipe, only subbing in a gluten free flour blend in place of all purpose to keep it allergen-free.
The result – oh man – no joke, the best gluten free pizza crust I’ve ever had. She even prefers it over restaurant versions now and I nearly prefer it over GLUTEN versions at regular pizzerias! It’s that good. If you have gluten free eaters in your life you simply must try this recipe. As Nacho Libre says, “It’s the baaayyyyysst.”

I convinced Laura to let me share her recipe and photograph her making it. So John and I joined her and her husband Ben at their place on a recent weeknight evening. We split a couple bottles of wine, made pizza and I took photos. Oh yes, and we laughed and joked. We always do. These guys are the best. Husbands watched on as the women worked. Typical ; )


We went with pepperoni for our main topping, boys’ request. The girls pizza had Daiya mozzarella shreds to keep it dairy-free, since Laura and I try to avoid dairy whenever possible. It was insanely delicious. This pizza is super, seriously. Insanely good. It’s so good, in fact, that just looking at it I want it again, RIGHT NOW.
The best part? Just 7 ingredients (with the gluten free flour blend) and about an hour from start to finish! The result? A crust that actually gets crisp on the outsides and stays a little tender on the inside. It is a bit delicate as most gluten free breads are, but certainly nothing one can’t master. I’ve watched Laura make it dozens of times now and she’s getting quite good at it. She doesn’t even need the recipe and eyeballs when something looks off.
As Shauna Niequist shares in her new book “Bread and Wine,” try a recipe once and follow it to a “t.” Try it a second time and make your own tweaks. Try it a third time by memory and it’s yours. Enjoy.

What are you waiting for? Make. This. Pizza!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).In a small bowl, combine yeast and 3/4 cup warm water (180 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)  - about 110 degrees F (43 C). Too hot and it will kill the yeast! Let set for 5 minutes to activate. Sprinkle in 1 Tbsp of the sugar (12 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) a few minutes in.In a separate bowl, combine gluten free flour blend, salt, baking powder and remaining 2 Tbsp sugar (25 g // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Whisk until well combined.Make a well in the dry mixture and add the yeast mixture. Add the olive oil and additional 1/2 cup warm water (120 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) before stirring. Then stir it all together until well combined, using a wooden spoon (see photo).Lightly coat a baking sheet or pizza stone with non-stick spray and plop your dough down. Using your hands and a little brown rice flour if it gets too sticky, work from the middle and push to spread/flatten the dough out to the edge (see pictures). You want it to be pretty thin - less than 1/4 inch.Put the pizza in the oven to pre-bake for roughly 25-30 minutes, or until it begins to look dry. Cracks may appear, but that's normal and totally OK.Remove from oven and spread generously with your favorite pizza sauce, cheese and desired toppings. We went with Daiya to keep ours dairy-free. Pop back in oven for another 20-25 minutes, or until the crust edge looks golden brown and the toppings are warm and bubbly.Cut immediately and serve. Reheats well the next day in the oven or microwave."
797,Copycat SQ Blizzards + 1-Year Anniversary! | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Copycat Dairy Queen Cupcakes + 1 Year Blogging Anniversary!

You guys, it’s been a year. One whole year. Happy birthday, Minimalist Baker! The cutest baby I’ve ever had (so far).
John and I are currently off celebrating the completion of his law degree and this wonderful, wonderful life we have with a trip to South Korea and Bali. We have friends there we’d been dying to visit and who agreed to be our obligatory tour guides while we shack up in bungalows and learn how to surf during our 20+ day island- and country-hopping tour.
Lots of inspiration – both food and cultural – to be shared once we get back. But until then, let’s talk ice cream, minimalism and how this humble site began.

Minimalist Baker was an afterthought. I’d already been food blogging for a couple years on another site when the idea for a new food blog suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks.
Minimalist Baker was born at Chipotle, so to speak. One evening, as John and I were chatting over steak and veggie bowls, respectively, I told him I had an idea for a new site I’d been thinking of. I wanted to call it Minimalist Baker, and it would be entirely focused on simple, healthy recipes with minimal ingredients and equipment – an exact reflection of how I approach cooking.
I’ve always loved food blogs and have followed them for years. But I always found that when a recipe – no matter how tempting it may be – required more than 7 or so ingredients, I bolted, never to consider it again. So the idea behind this new blog would be to keep things simple, focused and entirely minimalist, not only for my benefit but for yours, too.

I knew John thought it was a great idea because his eyes got really big as I was sharing. Like clockwork.
We threw some ideas back and forth and the framework came to be right there over our corn salsa, gauc and chips. Days later John had finished the framework and I got to work on our first recipe – Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes– which is still our most popular post on Minimalist Baker.
You guys, that post has 621,000 pins to date! We did it, and yes I mean WE. This site wouldn’t be what it is today without your feedback and tweets and pins and love. So thank you for helping us making this site flourish.

In one year we have done a lot. Since our first post we’ve:

Published a FREE7 Ingredients Or Less E-Cookbook.
Collaborated to create a FREE 1 Cup Water E-Cookbook,which raised $1,000 for Charity:Water.
Published a Detox Guide with 12 healthy recipes to help you hit the “reset” button on your diet.
Created an entire Food Photography E-Coursefor $19.99 – a product to help you start taking better food photos today.
Created an entire Blog Resources page to help you start a food blog, grow it, and improve your blogging skills (more to come on that front soon!)
Published an E-Book outlining 5 Ways to Make Your Photos Go Further (Faster).


So what’s next? Well, for one we’re celebrating with a vegan version of our favorite Dairy Queen childhood treat: A copycat Dairy Queen Cupcake. See how it all went down on Instagram and Vine. Our version is made with coconut milk chocolate ice cream, Oreos, vegan hot fudge, coconut milk vanilla ice cream and coconut whipped cream.
Yep, it’s all in there: 5 sexy layers of dairy-free goodness. My cupcakes were so good I could’ve eaten both, with two spoons AT THE SAME TIME. Maybe I did. Who can recount such details…?
Make these cupcakes to enjoy this summer, and in the meantime just know that we love that you’re here and want you to stick around probably forever. Or at least until the internet dies. If this next year is anything like our first year, we know it will be a friggin’ blast. Cheers!

798,Pretzel Frozen Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pretzel Frozen Hot Chocolate

I have dreams. Big dreams of going to New York City at Christmas time with John, getting all bundled up in winter coats and hats and scarves, standing in awe before the Rockefeller Christmas tree in Times Square. Of going out for an overpriced steak dinner. Of visiting vegan bakery after Greek yogurt bar after New York style pizza shop. Of gawking at strangers and taking in a new city.
This dream also includes frozen hot chocolate. I’ve heard Serendipity has the best, but in the meantime this salty, sexier version will have to do. I think I’m (more than) OK with that.

The base is mocha coconut ice cubes. Full-fat coconut milk stirred with cocoa powder and frozen into ice cubes. Then add almond milk, chocolate syrup, a little sweetener to taste, and a big handful of crushed pretzels. The icing on the proverbial cake is homemade coconut (or dairy) whipped cream, more chocolate sauce and salty pretzel sticks.
Serendipity who?


This is kind of the frozen hot chocolate of my dreams, and it’s vegan! Coconut and almond milk keep it so, and chocolate syrup makes it sappy, chocolatey sweet. I love salty-sweet combinations, so pretzels were a natural fit. I think I’m in love, and the feeling isn’t going away any time soon. Wanna make it mutual? I really think you do…

This hot chocolate is thick, creamy, chocolaty, and milky. Perfectly sweet with a kick of salt from the pretzels. Lick it slurp it gulp it. Do what you will. I did all three, shamelessly and I think you should, too. It’s hot outside; let’s all cool down with some pretzel frozen hot chocolate, shall we?
Yeah, let’s do that.


Hubba hubba.

","Add chocolate coconut ice cubes, ice cubes, almond milk and 4 Tbsp chocolate syrup to start to blender and blend until smooth, adding more almond milk as needed.Taste and add more chocolate syrup OR sweetener if needed. I added one half packet of non-bitter stevia, but agave or additional chocolate syrup will do just fine.Pour into two serving glasses and top with desired toppings. I went with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, crushed pretzels, and two pretzel sticks."
799,Loaded Black Bean Sweet Potato Boats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Loaded Black Bean Sweet Potato Boats

My obsession with sweet potatoes is getting real. I’ve made soups, muffins, gratins, chips, desserts. You name it, I’ve tried it. But I think after all that experimenting I’ve come back around to loving them in one of their purest forms: Soft, sweet and baked.

I was inspired to make these little bites after wanting to make a “nacho-like” dish starring twice-baked sweet potatoes. The idea to add black beans was natural. The two pair together like PB&amp;J. Then I just had to do some elegant dressing: Green onions, salsa, manchego cheese, and avocado crema.

These little bites are so simple to throw together.
Just bake until soft, split open, scoop out the insides, and then load them up with black beans or a protein of your choice and sprinkle with cheese. Pop them back in the oven to warm through and bam – you have an easy appetizer or vegetarian entree to share with friends…or hog all for yourself. Your call.
To make these vegan, simply use non-dairy substitutions for sour cream and cheese (such as Daiya products), sub just guacamole, or omit altogether.

These loaded “boats” are sweet, savory and so satisfying. I had just a couple for lunch along with some chips and salsa and was full for hours.
They’d make a great take-along dish to barbecues, especially for vegan/gluten-free/vegetarian friends. I just love that they’re healthy, loaded with flavor and super simple. But the fact that they’re portable doesn’t hurt either. Happy munching!

","Bake sweet potatoes in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven directly on the baking rack for 40-45 minutes or until tender to the touch.In the meantime, make avocado crema by mixing 1/2 a ripe avocado, 1/4 cup light sour cream and a bit of lime juice until creamy and smooth (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Refrigerate until potato boats are ready to serve.Remove from oven to cool to the touch, but leave oven on.Carefully cut sweet potatoes in half and scoop out insides to make “boats.” Leave ~ 1/4 – 1/2 inch of flesh so they don’t become too fragile and difficult to handle.Reserve leftover sweet potato for sweet potato almond butter muffins, or another recipe of your choice.Place sweet potato boats face up on a baking sheet and fill with black beans and top evenly with grated cheese.Pop back in oven to warm through and remove when cheese is melted and bubbly.Remove from oven and arrange on a serving platter. Top with salsa, avocado crema, chopped green onion and fresh cilantro. Additional toppings might include guacamole, hot sauce and lettuce.Will reheat well the next day or two in the microwave or oven."
800,Black Bean Green Chili Enchiladas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Black Bean, Green Chili, &amp; Manchego Enchiladas

Have you ever accidentally met a new best friend? I have. Many times over.
My teacher hippie friend Heather and I – who has the most voluminous messy blonde hair you’ll ever hate not having – met at a summer camp in Northern California in 2006 when she took the job as a stand-in lifeguard and I was a 9- and 10-year-old girls counselor. It was her first day and I hated seeing her so alone not knowing anyone, so I walked over and introduced myself. After a spattering of exchanges we quickly bonded over a love for exercise, big hair and blueberries and oatmeal for breakfast. The rest is history.
Though we only spent two full months together that summer, we were like sisters by the time I flew back to Kansas in August. And it was one of the most bittersweet days of my young adult life.

Another new best friend story I’ve been loving to tell lately is one that happened just recently. John and I were still in the market for a new rental about a month ago. We’d called on a place and made a 3:30 appointment and got there right on the dot. We walked up and were greeted by the realtor…and another couple who’d also been promised a 3:30 showing.
You’d think the whole situation would’ve been painfully awkward but one joke from John suggesting the place was big enough to “go splitsies on,” and we were laughing it up like longtime friends.

As I tell it now, we totally “hit it off” and have been hanging out ever since. They may not be our “best friends” yet, but I’m working on it. I can only make so much bonding magic happen in a matter of 4 weeks.

Our new friends moved here from Ohio and ended up buying a big house right down the street from our new duplex. Upon their arrival they literally had no dishes, furniture or food, so John had the brilliant idea to take them dinner. Why didn’t I, in all of my hostess-y food blogging glory think of that?
I decided to attempt enchiladas: Simple, transportable, affordable, and great for pleasing a large crowd. To keep the filling vegetarian, I went with black beans, sour cream, green chilis, and Manchego cheese. And to avoid gluten, I opted for corn tortillas – a first for me, so this was a bit of an experiment.
Though they turned out a little bit soggy because I didn’t drench them in hot oil before rolling up – a process I’d read about that sounded complicated and excessive to me – they were super flavorful and filling. This can avoided by simply opting for flour tortillas (see my notes below). I served ours with grilled fajita peppers and onions and a touch more sour cream, and they were simply delicious. John even got seconds, and that’s saying a lot since he’s usually a one serving and out kind of guy.
On paper plates in a near-empty living room with wine in Dixie cups, we dined. And we dined well. Chips, salsa, wine and these savory beauties. I hope our friends felt welcomed; we sure hope they do now that they are thousands of miles from “home.” Considering their first-time success, I recommend makingthese enchiladas and sharing with friends – new and old – I have a feeling they’ll kind of love you for it. Promise.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and position a baking rack in the middle of the oven.Combine black beans, green chilies, sour cream and manchego cheese in a mixing bowl. Taste and add salt and pepper if desired. Cumin may also be a good addition, but fine without. Set aside.Warm 3/4 of the enchilada sauce in a large shallow pan over low-medium heat.Pour a small amount of enchilada sauce to lightly coat the bottom of a 9x13 dish (adjust pan size if altering batch size).Transfer one tortilla at a time to the baking dish, scoop in 2 Tbsp of the black bean filling and roll up. Place seam side down and continue until the pan is filled – should be about 10-12 enchiladas (as original recipe is written).Top enchiladas with a bit more enchilada sauce down the middle (adding too much sauce can make these soggy).Top with a bit more cheese and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly.Serve with toppings such as avocado, guacamole, salsa, fajita veggies, sour cream, green onion, cilantro or lettuce.Will keep in the fridge for a couple days.

801,Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes (Vegan + Gluten-Free)

Let’s get one thing straight. These pancakes may be healthier than they actually appear, but they aren’t health food. So put away your calorie rulers and speculative eye and let’s get on with this dang thing.

What we have here is peanut butter cup-inspired pancakes. Then we put an actual homemade peanut butter cup on top and eat the whole stack, because life is short and we love chocolate, peanut butter and breakfast. What more explanation do you need?


This recipe is gluten free and vegan but can be customized to suit your needs and preferences. Oat flour and my go-to GF flour blend keep the gluten devils at bay, but I honestly think all purpose or whole wheat pastry would make these a tad bit fluffier.
If you don’t want a flax egg, don’t know what it is, or simply don’t believe in it (like John), omit it and use a chicken egg instead. This is your pancake arena. Rule it how you will.

Now, onto more important things: what do they taste like?
The pancakes themselves aren’t overly sweet but have the perfect hint of chocolate and peanut butter. The outer ring is infused with cocoa powder, and the inner ring is all about the peanut butter.
Because these are gluten free they don’t take on that traditional “fluffy” pancake texture, but if you’ve been around here long enough you know I’m OK with that. In fact, I almost prefer a thick, dense, fudgy pancake. There’s a time and a place for fluffy pancakes. This is not it.


Can we just talk about how insanely sexy these pancakes are!? You MUST, and I mean must top them with an actual peanut butter cup. It 100%makes it.
I made mine following Sprouted Kitchen’s famous dark chocolate almond butter cups, only subbed peanut butter, and I highly recommend you do the same. They’re so, so good and get all melty, steamy and gooey on top of the cakes. It’s like frosting on a pancake. Who doesn’t want frosting on a pancake, really?
You, raising your hand, get out of here.More pancakes for the rest of us! Enjoy.

","Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 350 degrees F / 176 C), or a large skillet on the stove stop. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot – oil shouldn’t smoke when it makes contact with the surface.To a large mixing bowl add flaxseed and water and let set for a minute or two. Then add melted coconut oil, agave nectar (or honey/maple syrup), baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract and whisk to combine. Add almond milk (starting with lesser end of range and adding a touch more if needed) and whisk again until well combined.Next add oat and gluten free flour and stir until just combined. Taste and see if it needs more agave. I added a bit more.Divide batter in half and add cocoa powder to one bowl and peanut butter to the other. Mix until just combined. Add more almond milk if PB made it too thick. You want a pourable batter that's not ""gloppy.""Once the griddle is hot, lightly grease and spoon on scant 1/4 cup measure of chocolate batter, then scant 1/4 cup of peanut butter in the center. Cook until the edges appear dry and bubbles form on top, then carefully flip. Cook for another 2-ish minutes on the other side. Will make 5-6 pancakes.Divide between serving plates and top with a peanut butter cup split in half or a Tbsp or two dark chocolate chips.Dig in and enjoy. Will reheat fine in the microwave the next day."
802,S'mores Rice Krispie Treats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"S’mores Rice Krispie Treats

Oh yes, we’re going there.


I was at Noodles and Co. for the first time a few weeks ago with John and our cellist/runner friend, Arleigh. After scanning the menu and coming to our respective conclusions about what was thee best noodle dish, we approached the cashier and delivered our verdicts.
John – penne marinara.
Me – pad Thai with tofu.
Arleigh, pad Thai without tofu. (side note: Arleigh later tried to steal my tofu because she sub consciously wanted it but forgot to order it. Don’t worry, DIDN’T HAPPEN. Mama needs her tofus.)


Anyway, after placing our orders Arleigh’s eyes got all big when she spotted the basket of desserts, which included rice krispie treats – her fave. “Let’s get the biggest one and split it,” she said, and without waiting for our response she snagged the biggest krispie in the bunch.Off we went to the drink station.
The water/soda machine was fancy, digital, not like our familiar Chipotle’s. Arleigh went first as the Noodles and Co. veteran to show us the proper way, selecting the water button first before putting her cup below the spout.
John walked up next and, with a smirk looked back at me and said, “I got this.” He then leaned in very close to the machine and yelled “WATER,” and then put his cup under the spout and filled it up to the brim. At that point I felt all the drink station jokes had been used up so I just filled up my water and proceeded to our table for 8 where we gladly parked our three hungry white butts.

The tofu thing happened. I slapped Arleigh’s fork away. We all agreed Noodles and Co. would be a terrible place for a first date. An adorable family of 5 at the table next to us kept us well entertained. And at the end of the meal it was time for the krispie, which we ruggedly split three ways with the dullest butter knife we could find. Marshmallow strings ensued. We were a happy bunch.
As I bit into my portion I offered up a rice krispie recipe idea I’d had to add toasted marshmallows instead of regular ones, to give them more of a s’mores feel. Looking at Arleigh you’d think I’d have just proclaimed women shouldn’t have the right to vote or own property. She is a rice krispie purist if I’ve ever met one. Butter, marshmallow, rice cereal. THEY DON’T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

One week later I was still determined to attempt my s’mores krispie and was so stinking pleased with the results that I had to share. With you all, of course, but also with friends; namely Arleigh.
Two bites in and she agreed it wasn’t such a bad idea after all. I seriously doubt I impressed her so much that she’d request a s’mores over an original, but I did prove that originals can be tweaked and improved and made more fun. So there.


Friends, these krispies were made for summer. For cookouts. For camping trips. For messy picnic style dessert. For hot days, rainy days, lake days. They are light and crispy with hints of graham cracker and toasted mallows. The dark chocolate on top gives them a whole new level of decadence. If you make anything from this site this summer – any one thing – make these krispies. You will be the envy of the neighborhood block party for sure. Bottoms up!


","Butter a 9x13 dish and set aside (adjust pan size if altering batch size).Preheat oven to hi-broil and position oven rack on the very top.Pour marshmallows onto one or two lightly greased baking sheets (use fewer or more if adjusting batch size), depending on their size, being careful not to lose any mallows if they're not rimmed. Place under broiler and watch closely as they'll toast up quickly. Remove when they're dark brown. Set aside.In a large pot over medium-low heat, quickly melt the butter and then add the marshmallows, scraping them off the pan with a rubber spatula - a little bit will stick but that's OK. Just get as much as you can.Stir and cook for a minute or two until melted and well combined. Then add the rice cereal and graham crackers and stir until well combined. Transfer immediately to the baking dish.After 5 or so minutes of cooling, add the chocolate bars and press so they stick to the tops of the rice krispies. I waited a little too long and they didn't quite stick, so use your best judgement - you want them still a tad warm but not hot.Cut into about 15 squares (as original recipe is written) and serve immediately! Will keep covered for a few days."
803,Perfect Grilled Corn Salsa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Perfect Grilled Corn Salsa

Summer = grilled corn. It’s as simple as that.At least that’s how we do summertime in the Midwest.
Come for a visit and you’ll see. We’ll feed you lots of grilled corn, bbq chicken, and hard apple cider. It’s what we live on come May – August.

Make this grilled corn salsa and you’ll understand what we’re obsessing over. Sweet, slightly charred grilled corn, fresh tomatoes, onion and cilantro, lime juice and a little heat from serrano pepper. Heaven in a dip, I say.Your summer’s about to get a little more legit.

There’s seemingly a hundred different ways to grill corn and everyone’s got their own trick. Well, we’re no exception. John and I have grilled tons of corn during our three years of marriage and we’ve gotten pretty darn good at it. Not to brag, but we know what we’re doing when it comes to grilled corn.
The trick? Leave the husk on and grill it first, then once it gets a char remove the husk and strings and put it back on for a little color. Two-three minutes later and you have grilled corn perfection on your hands.

This salsa is everything I love – sweet, savory, spicy, crunchy, and fresh. It’s perfect with chips, on top of tacos, tostadas, or enchiladas, inside quesadillas and atop Mexican pizzas. Perfect any way you serve it – you really can’t go wrong.

What are you waiting for? Get a chip and dig in!
*mad props to @gnarleighjen for being my bodacious hand model. babe alert.

","To grill corn (preferably over charcoal for best flavor), leave the husk on and grill it first until charred. Then remove the husk and strings and put it back on the grill for a little color – 2-3 minutes – rolling to heat all sides.Once grilled, slice corn off of the cob and add to bowl with remaining ingredients and stir.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt, pepper, or lime juice for added flavor.Serve immediately. Will keep covered in the fridge for several days, but is best when fresh."
804,Gluten-Free Vegan Banana Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banana Almond Meal Muffins (Gluten-Free + Vegan)

My love for muffins has been going strong for 26 years now and has no intention of slowing. It all started with the crumb-top blueberry muffins my grandma would make for the grandkids.
I’d wake up early in a messy-haired daze and eagerly round the corner to the kitchen to always find a plate of fresh baked muffins on the counter. My grandma is the best at food, period. I’d heat up two jumbo-sized gems and slather them in butter. Breakfast of champions, I tell you.

The only bad thing about muffins – besides the fact that you always want two or three – is that they can often be carb- and sugar-heavy.
In recent years, though, I’ve experimented a ton with making these breakfast stars a bit healthier, and I succeeded with recipes like my vegan banana nut muffins for 2, and sweet potato almond butter muffins, among others.
This banana almond meal variety is certainly on the healthier side, too, but full of flavor and nutty texture.

Besides being gluten-free and vegan, these muffins are also extremely low in sugar with just a few tablespoons of natural sweetener – such as agave or maple syrup. Gluten-free “flours” like oat flour and almond meal keep these GF-friendly. And they’re insanely moist and flavorful thanks to the mashed banana. Kind of perfect in the muffin world, if you ask me. Plus, just 1 bowl required? Party on.

Straight out of the oven these are PERFECTION slathered in a little almond butter and sliced banana. (Honey for non-vegans is a must).
They aren’t overwhelmingly heavy or sweet, making them a great post-workout snack or light breakfast to get your metabolism churning first thing in the morning. I enjoyed mine as an afternoon snack to tide me over between meals. They’d even make a great after-dinner “dessert.” These muffins can do no wrong.

But seriously, the almond butter, banana, honey suggestion? DO IIIIITTTTT.

NOTE: Recipe updated January 8, 2016 to include: increased baking time, emphasis on cooling, as well as emphasis on using almond meal ground from raw almonds (not pre-ground store-bought). Also, these muffins are meant to retain their moisture even after cooling. If you’re looking for a more crumbly muffin, check out these Vegan GF Banana Muffins!
","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a muffin tin with 8 paper liners (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).In a large bowl, prepare flax egg by mixing flaxseed + water and letting rest for a few minutes.Next add bananas and mash. Add agave, baking powder, vanilla, almond milk and stir.Add almond meal and oat flour and stir once more. Taste to see if it needs more sweetener. I added a touch more because I prefer sweeter muffins.Bake for 30-40 (+) minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and they become somewhat firm to the touch with a little give. They should appear golden brown on top.Remove and let rest in pan for 5 minutes. Then let cool completely on a cooling rack. They can be tender when they're warm. (I even found that they are better after cooling overnight.)Store in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for several days. Freeze for longer storage."
805,Curry Roasted Carrots with Peanut Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curry Roasted Carrots with Peanut Sauce

These aren’t your mom’s carrots. No offense to your mom or her maple glazed carrot sticks, but these are a whole different ball game.

Besides peas, corn and canned pears, the only whole food my mom could get me to eat was carrots.She’d always cook them in pot roasts and they’d get so soft and sweet that I thought they were candy.

These roasted carrots take on a similar softness but are slightly more savory than sweet. That’s because I doused them in curry powder, one of my new favorite spice blends. The sweet comes from the carrot’s natural sweetness and homemade peanut sauce. Such a brilliant combination.

I attempted to make coconut millet for this recipe but it totally failed. So I tried it again using vegetable stock. Much tastier, much less sticky, much…better. If anyone masters the art of making coconut millet let me know. I certainly have not found the “trick” yet.

These carrots would make a lovely side to any entree, especially spicy grilled chicken or even baked lentils. I kind of love carrots on their own so I was content to just have them over the millet with a little peanut sauce, which I found plenty filling. But feel free to treat this recipe as inspiration and make it your own. That has me thinking a curried carrot peanut soup would be amazing….maybe next time.


","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Place carrots on baking sheet and toss with oil, salt, pepper and curry powder.Roast for 20-25 minutes or until tender and brown, tossing once halfway through.In the meantime prepare peanut sauce (see link above).Once carrots are roasted, place over 3/4 cup millet and top with peanut sauce. Other toppings might include sriracha, fresh herbs, crushed peanuts, or lime juice."
806,Rainbow Chard Hummus Wraps | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Rainbow Chard Hummus Wraps

Say hello to rainbow chard appearance number TWO. The first time sweet, this time savory. I don’t know which I’m more excited about. Think I’ll have to eat both.

Rainbow chard is so beautiful I could just stare at it all day. I mean look at those color contrasts and the hot pink vein! Get outta here. One of nature’s most perfect works of art, for sure.
But eventually I want to eat it. Contrary to what some may think it’s not bitter at all. Quite the opposite actually – tender, sweet and mild – making it the perfect vessel for creamy garlicky hummus (and peanut butter, banana + basil).


I used my favorite hummus but if you’re short on time or just prefer store bought, go ahead! I’m all about saving time and hassle. I just make a batch of my own every couple weeks to have on hand for snacks and quick lunches.

This concept is so simple and customizable. Simply smear your favorite spread onto the chard and top with tons of veggies. I kept mine simple with cucumber, tomato and onion, but you could also easily add herbs, a grainy mustard or even fruit.

This wrap makes the perfect bite to take on the go, such as for work lunches, picnics or beach outings. I suspect they’d taste better on the beach than in an office cubicle, but it’s just a hunch. Food tastes better in nature if you ask me.

","Rinse and dry your swiss chard, chop off the stem, and shave the bottom thicker part of the stem so it will roll up easier.Then, top the center with hummus and veggies, wrap up and enjoy. You can also secure it with toothpicks or wrap it in parchment to take on the go."
807,Frozen Blended Vegan White Russian | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Frozen Blended Vegan White Russian

Things are about to get sexy up in here, White Russian style.

Back in my naive, just turned 21 days, I didn’t know a thing about ordering a cocktail. Long lists of complicated drink names only confused me, and after one too many well-intentioned friends tried to “initiate” me with a Jägerbomb, I nearly signed off liquor altogether.
Then came the White Russian.

A White Russian is so creamy, sweet, delicious and secretly potent. I didn’t figure out the potent part until I downed three within one hour and was then found running laps in a nearby parking lot just for fun. Hmmm, glad I’m not 21.5 anymore.
While a traditional White Russian is comprised of vodka, Kahlua and cream, I wanted to keep mine vegan so I opted for full fat coconut milk instead. Freeze those babies into cubes and you have the base for one seriously sensational frozen cocktail.

The coffee gets everything going in your blender and adds another element of coffee goodness to this drink. I could’ve slurped the whole batch down, but then I would’ve been running laps around our backyard and John would’ve have that. Thankfully I’m 26 now and just a tad wiser than my 21-year-old self. THANK GOODNESS.


This beverage is a D-R-E-A-M. Creamy, coffee-infused, plenty boozy and only slightly coconutty. Topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce and it’s pure sin. Oh lordy, we’re going all in. Wanna join?

","To make coconut ice cubes, simply shake and stir a can of full fat coconut milk (or use light coconut milk OR unsweetened almond milk, though it won't be as creamy) and pour it into an ice cube mold. Freeze until completely hardened - 5-7 hours or overnight.Add coconut ice cubes, coffee, vodka and Kahlua to a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust sweetness if needed, adding agave nectar, stevia or honey (if not vegan) if desired.Pour into 2 tall or 4 short serving glasses (as original recipe is written) and top with chocolate sauce and/or coconut whipped cream."
808,Thai Sweet Potato Stacks with Peanut Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Thai Sweet Potato Stacks with Peanut Sauce

You know it. That first moment you discover a flavor combination so unimaginably perfect that you simply must have it again and again and again. Such was the case with peanut butter and basil for me. Since then, I’ve been cramming the duo into dishes and desserts like there’s no tomorrow.
My new obsession is more of a trio: Peanut butter, sweet potato + cilantro.

Being that I’m such a huge lover of Thai food – John and I eat it most weeks – it seemed natural to fuse it into other types of cuisines and foods I love. One such food is sweet potatoes.
They’re so versatile in both sweet and savory settings, and I could eat one every day and never tire of them. So it was only a matter of time before I slapped vegetables and peanut sauce on them and called it a meal. Plus, I loved the Mexican-inspired version so much I had to recreate it again.

The concept for this dish is simple: roasted sweet potato rounds, sauteed greens with soy sauce + garlic, peanut sauce, fresh carrots + cilantro all stacked together in one Thai-inspired dish. Perfect for lunch, a snack or a light dinner. These would even make a great small bite preceding a bigger meal. Oh the possibilities.

The sweet potatoes are perfectly complemented by the crunchy greens. The carrots and cilantro add a fresh, flavorful crunch. And the peanut sauce is the liquid gold that holds it all together. The only way it could be improved is by adding some sriracha over top, which I highly highly recommend. Peanut sauce and sriracha were meant to be together, I’m telling you.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray or brush with oil. Add sweet potatoes and toss with half of  sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Line in a single layer and cook for 20-25 minutes or until softened and slightly browned.In the meantime, prepare peanut sauce (follow link for instructions), and saute garlic, green onions and baby bok choy in remaining sesame oil + the soy sauce, until soft. Set aside.Once sweet potatoes are ready, remove from oven and begin stacking them with a small amount of vegetables and peanut sauce between each layer. Alternatively, just make a mound of sweet potatoes and top with veggies and sauce “nacho” style. You will have leftover peanut sauce, which keeps covered in the fridge for up to a week.Top with chopped carrots, cilantro, sriracha and enjoy. Reheats nicely the next day."
809,Butter-Less Alfredo with Peas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butter-Less Alfredo with Peas

A funny thing happens when you break your blender: You have to figure out how to live without it. Waaaaaaaah.

My favorite alfredo sauce requires a little blending as it tends to get lumpy in spots if I’m not vigilant. But when my faithful G&amp;E blender of 7+ years busted on me last week and we’d promised friends who are new parents a pasta meal later that evening, I was forced to improvise.
Luckily I was able to make a few adjustments and even managed to IMPROVE my original alfredo recipe! Love it when that happens. This calls for new recipe sharing time.

My alfredo is based with olive oil instead of butter and requires simple ingredients you likely have on handright now. Pesto, parmesan cheese, milk, flour, garlic, veggie or chicken stock. That’s it! And it’s so creamy and delicious you wouldn’t believe it’s actually healthy.

This version was inspired by springtime.
The trees are lush, the flowers are in bloom, and the scent of freshly cut grass is in the air. About this, I couldn’t be more excited.My way of celebrating is by making a simple, light pasta with green peas – one of the only green things I’d eat as a kid. Sorry mom.

This sauce is thick and creamy with tons of parmesan-pesto flavor, yet remains light. The veggie stock adds a nice savory boost that pairs perfectly with any pasta. I chose linguine as it’s my favorite canoodle, but any shape will do.
How is there no blending or pureeing required? I add the flour and whisk it with the olive oil and garlic BEFORE I add any liquid. Then a spatula helps mash everything together so I can forgo any blending.
Hooray for simplicity, no?

While peas remain the primary addition to this pasta, you can also add some grilled chicken for more protein, or even some toasted walnuts or pine nuts for a little vegetarian staying power.
I served mine with extra parmesan on top, a little garlic bread and the leftover peas, which I steamed and lightly seasoned. If this isn’t the perfect spring/summertime meal, I don’t know what is.

","Cook pasta according to package instructions.Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and garlic, stirring quickly to ensure it doesn’t burn.Next, reduce heat slightly and add flour (starting with lower end of range // 2 Tbsp as original recipe is written) and whisk to combine. Cook for about a minute and then add veggie stock and milk and use a flat spatula to mash the flour into the liquid.Add salt, pepper, pesto, grated parmesan cheese and stir. Cook on medium heat until it bubbles, and then reduce heat to low-medium heat and cook until thickened. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed – I usually add a bit more salt and pepper toward the end.If you notice the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk or broth. If too thin, add a little more flour and whisk to combine. Alternatively, you can thicken with more parmesan cheese.Once sauce is ready, add the peas and stir. Then add the drained cooked pasta and toss to combine, adding more salt and pepper if needed. Serve immediately with additional parmesan cheese on top. Garlic bread and steamed broccoli or peas are excellent additions to this simple dish."
810,Lemon Blueberry Waffles (V+GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lemon Blueberry Waffles {Vegan + Gluten-Free}

When I set off to create a gluten-free waffle that satisfied my my pickiest of waffle cravings, I succeeded with my recipe forGF vegan waffles. You guys loved them too as I’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback! Whoop whoop. Let’s keep this waffle train rollin’.


From that basic concept I altered the recipe to explore new flavors and a slightly different flour combination.
They still remain totally vegan and gluten free and supah healthy. And they taste like a lemon blueberry muffin. Yeah, you’re gonna want to jot this recipe down and try it this weekend. I’ll wait while you get your pen and pad….


Lemon blueberry (vegan + gluten-free) waffles! These little guys are a gem. I made my first batch last week and am already down to one waffle. Clearly I didn’t do a good job of rationing my supply.


These waffles are SO easy to prepare, coming together in about 30 minutes and requiring a minimal amount of equipment. Plus, they’re extremely customizable.
If you aren’t gluten-free, just use all-purpose, wheat or another variety of flour you have on hand.
If you aren’t vegan, use real eggs.
If you lack blueberries, swap in another berry instead. I have my eyes on blackberries next – so stoked.

What do they taste like?
A dream. Softer than the original version, but still slightly crispy on the outside. They’re loaded with lemon flavor and each bite is dotted with warm blueberries.


I’ve been enjoying mine in the morning with extra blueberries, a little almond butter, sliced banana, and maple syrup.
Because they freeze well, they’re the perfect quick healthy breakfast option to grab, toast, eat and go. I also love that they’re special enough for a lazy weekend meal and simple enough for rushed weekday mornings. What more could you ask for from a waffle? Not much, I think. Enjoyyyyyy.

","Preheat waffle iron to desired level of heat - I prefer mine crispy.Combine almond milk and vinegar in a large liquid measuring cup or small mixing bowl and let set for a few minutes to curdle/activate. Then add melted butter, vanilla extract, lemon juice and zest, and agave nectar or maple syrup and whisk. Set aside.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Fold in blueberries.Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or vegan butter and pour on about ⅓ cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a baking rack in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm. Do not stack - keep them in a single layer to keep crispy.Serve immediately with desired toppings. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results. Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple months, although they’re best when eaten within the first couple weeks.Suggested toppings: almond butter or vegan butter, flaxseed, bananas, blueberries, maple syrup."
811,5-Ingredient Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy 5-Ingredient Granola Bars

John and I kind of have a thing for granola bars. It started when we discovered the glory that is Trader Joe’s Apple (Pie) Bars. Then, we got into more basic versions with rolled oats. But somewhere along the line we got suspicious of the ingredients – namely high fructose corn devil – and strayed away from them altogether.
However, sometimes you really just need a snack that has some serious staying power. And being that this is Minimalist Baker, you know I wanted something simple. Enter: The 5-Ingredient (No-Bake) Granola Bar. Things are getting seriously minimalist right now.




The base for these bars is dates – the natural sweetener supah powah. Then we add almonds, oats, peanut butter, and honey (or maple syrup) and mix it all together!
That’s it. Just 5 ingredients, no baking involved (unless you want to toast the oats and almonds) and they’ll keep in the freezer for-ever (that is, if you can resist them for that long).


If you can’t jive with peanut butter simply swap in almond, sunflower or another nut/seed butter. To keep these vegan, stick with maple syrup or agave instead of honey. And to keep them gluten-free, use GF oats. Simple, customizable, delicious.


Speaking of delicious, these little guys are dreamy.
Simple flavors, wholesome ingredients, salty-sweet and lots of crunch. I made a batch last week and am already down to one-quarter of ONE bar. How I exercised the self control to save one quarter of a bar is beyond me. But by tomorrow it likely won’t be there, if I know myself at all.

These really are the perfect bar for a hearty snack because they keep you full for hours and don’t provide a sugar overload. Plus, they pack in plenty of healthy fats from the almonds and peanut butter, and lots of fiber from the oats. Afternoon and mid-morning snack, solved.



September 23, 2016: Video added and recipe updated to include slightly more dates so the bars stick together more easily.
","Process dates in a food processor until small bits remain (about 1 minute). It should form a ""dough"" like consistency. (Mine rolled into a ball.)Optional step: Toast your oats (and almonds if raw) in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 10-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Otherwise, leave them raw - I prefer the toasted flavor.Place oats, almonds and dates in a large mixing bowl - set aside.Warm honey and peanut butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir and pour over oat mixture and then mix, breaking up the dates to disperse throughout.Once thoroughly mixed, transfer to an 8x8-inch baking dish or other small pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily. (A loaf pan might work, but will yield thicker bars // adjust size of pan if altering batch size).Press down firmly until uniformly flattened - I use something flat, like a drinking glass, to press down and really pack the bars, which helps them hold together better.Cover with parchment or plastic wrap, and let firm up in fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes.Remove bars from pan and chop into 10 even bars (or 9 squares // as original recipe is written). Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. I kept mine in the freezer to keep them extra fresh, but it isn't necessary."
812,Stoplight Mango Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Stoplight Mango Green Smoothie

I made this smoothie because, well, sometimes you need to break out of the mundane and turn your breakfast into something fun like a stoplight. Or a cookie. Or a muff-cake. See? Who said breakfast should ever be mundane…

The inspiration for this smoothie is none other than my favorite fruit at the moment: MANGO. The base is frozen mango – I bought mine fresh, chopped them up and froze them – then with each layer you introduce a new flavor. In this case it’s strawberry and spinach. But overall, the mango is the dominant flavor. Hooray!
Also, hooray for super cute straws I found at Target (while not shopping for straws – whoops)! Hooray!

As to how you get that layered effect, simply blend your mango base and pour half in the glass; then add strawberries, blend and pour it on top, and lastly add a handful of spinach, blend and pour it on top. BOOM. Yellow, red, green! Stoplight smoothie for the win.

Breakfast? Yes. Lunch? Yes. Snack? Totally. Go wild friends. Go wild with breakfast again. I give you permission.

","Place mango into a blender with milk or water and blend until smooth, adding more mango to thicken and more water or milk to thin.Pour 2/3 of the smoothie into a serving container and then add strawberries to the blender. Blend until smooth, adding a bit more water or almond milk if needed. Taste to see if it needs to be sweetened. I added 1/2 a small frozen banana at this point.Pour 3/4 of the smoothie into the serving glass on top of the mango layer.Lastly, add spinach to the blender and blend until smooth. Pour into the serving glass, making three distinct layers.Sip and enjoy, or freeze for later."
813,Gluten-Free Breakfast Tostadas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Breakfast Tostadas

When testing my recipe for Vegan Dessert Nachosa while back,my friend Laura let me borrow a few of her gluten-free brown rice tortillas to try out along with my whole wheat tortillas. I didn’t expect it, but the gluten-free ones were much better than the whole wheat! Since then, as I’ve been trying to minimize gluten in my diet, I’ve opted for g-free options when I can.
These tortillas are my new go-to for wraps and the like, and make a perfect tostada base when toasted up and seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper.


They become so roasty, crisp, and flavorful when you bake them on high heat for just a few minutes. They’re absolutely lovely tossed in cinnamon sugar for dessert nachos, but when seasoned with savory flavors they’re equally delicious.
Top them with a couple of over-easy eggs, salsa, veggies, and a little sour cream and cheese and you have a legit breakfast tostada on your hands.

While you can easily sub corn tortillas here to keep these gluten-free, I feel the brown rice tortillas are more nutritious and add a distinct crunch and flavor profile that the corn variety somehow lacks. They stay sturdy beneath the runny egg and salsa, making it possible to pick the whole thing up and eat it sans fork if you want! Don’t worry, I wouldn’t judge. I’d totally do it with you if you wanted.


These would make a fantastic weekend breakfast or brunch item, or even a quick and fairly simple lunch. From start to finish it took me about 15-20 minutes including oven preheat and all. Plus, the flavors are totally customizable. I went with radish, shredded kale, fresh salsa, and a little cheese + sour cream. But you could easily keep these dairy-free and go with avocado or guacamole instead.
They’re also a great break from tacos and taco salads, which I tend to make a bit too often. Plus, it feels indulgent since it’s crispy. But not to worry as these are 100% baked. Breakfast has been remade once again.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and place tortillas on a baking sheet. Brush both sides with olive, avocado or refined coconut oil and then sprinkle generously with sea salt, pepper and garlic powder.If your tortillas are too large, cut them into smaller circles with a pizza cutter and cut the smaller scraps into ""chips"" to bake alongside the tostada circles.Bake for 5-10 minutes or until brown and crispy on both sides. Watch them closely as they turn quickly.In the meantime, cook eggs as desired and set aside.Remove tostadas from oven and top with eggs and desired toppings."

Remember that date-sweetened horchata we made last week? Yeah, you’re gonna wanna snag that from your fridge again. I have something boozy for you today.

As with our vodka root beer floats, a little taste testing was necessary to determine which liquor best suits the flavors and texture of horchata. Because horchata is a bit thinner and has a distinct, sweet taste, rum and Kahlua (coffee + rum liqueur) were the top pairings. Either will work here, it just depends on if you like coffee. If a boozy, coffee-infused drink sounds good to you, go for Kahlua all the way. If not, stick with any dark rum.


This cocktail is incredibly easy to throw together. It consists of just three ingredients: Horchata + a little extra almond milk for creaminess + a shot of rum. A shaker isn’t necessary, I just wanted to give the photo a “pour” effect. It really works fine to just drop in your rum and give it a swirl. Cinco de Mayo or not, this cocktail is perfect for summertime gatherings and Mexican-inspired meals alike. Enjoy!

","Either add all ingredients to a shaker to combine, or simply divide horchata, almond milk, and rum between serving glasses, stir, and then add ice cubes.To sweeten, add a drizzle of honey or agave nectar. To thicken, add almond milk. Easy peasy!"
815,Peanut Butter Banana Basil Chard Wrap | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Banana Basil Rainbow Chard Wrap

So here’s the thing. I went to our local farmers market last weekend – the first time it’s been warm enough to go – and scored some totally awesome finds. Awesome for Wichita, that is.
You see, I used to live in Portland, Oregon, where farmers markets took up entire college campuses and housed hundreds of vendors, 5 of which sold nothing but strawberries. I had choices people, I had options. I was in produce heaven.

In Kansas, we’re in the heart of the Midwest where farming is supposed to be our gig, but for some reason farmers markets aren’t as abundant. It’s typically more of a picked-over tomato and homemade knickknack type of scene. To score some amazing looking carrots or fresh herbs or gorgeous heaps of kale is rare. Our markets simply don’t compare to coastal contenders.
But, but, at the recommendation of local friends I went to a market on the west side of town that boasted some of the freshest and biggest variety of produce I’ve ever seen in Kansas. I was so pleasantly surprised that I swiped up nearly $20 worth of organic goods and I’ve dedicated two entire recipes to my finds!
The first of which being this hippie-looking breakfast roll-up I’ve been digging that was originally inspired by my lovely friend Aubrey.

While on my Conscious Cleanse,gluten was out of the picture, so I turned to green alternatives instead. At the market I scored some amazingly gorgeous rainbow swiss chard from the sweetest mother and daughter – along witha handful of kale – and immediately went home to make a hearty yet clean breakfast roll-up.
The concept is simple. Simply rinse and dry a large leaf of rainbow chard, carve the vein down a bit if it’s too thick (or remove it altogether), slather on a nut butter – I went with salty natural peanut butter – top it with other additions, such as flax, basil and a banana, and roll the whole thing up!
I call it breakfast, my co-workers call it “that weird thing I was eating.” I’m convinced they’re the ones missing out.

You know I’ve loved the flavors of peanut butter and basil for a while now, and this wrap takes it to a whole new level. The rainbow chard is slightly sweet and crisp, the peanut butter-banana meld together like a dream, the flax adds a bit of earthiness and the basil gives it a distinct almost minty flavor.
I could eat this wrap over a stack of pancakes all day long. Don’t get me wrong, pancakes are great. But sometimes a girl just needs her greens.

","Flatten your rainbow chard and, with a knife, shave the stem down so it’s easier to roll up. Alternatively, cut out the bottom portion that tends to be more rigid.Starting at the bottom about 1/4 of the way up (see photos) smear on peanut butter, add flaxseed, banana and basil and roll the whole thing up like a regular wrap, tucking the sides in as you near the top. If your banana isn’t ripe/sweet enough, add a drizzle of honey or agave to sweeten.Secure with a tooth pick and cut in half. Or, simply grasp in your hands and enjoy immediately! I ate half at breakfast and carried the other half in a baggy for a snack later on. It was just as delicious a few hours later."
816,Vegan Brownie Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Brownie Chocolate Ice Cream

Oh dearly lordy dear kitchen in a hat basket I’ve done it again. This time, with chocolate.


You didn’t think I’d let my coconut ice cream obsession escape me without delving into the world chocolate, did you? Good, because if so I was going to have to start questioning our friendship, you and I.

This recipe is so so easy there’s no excuse for you not to try it as warmer temps arrive. The base is coconut and almond milk, cocoa powder brings a rich, chocolaty flavor, vanilla adds balance, and chunks of my vegan GF brownies bring it to a whole other dimension.

Just ask John how delicious it was. He caught me doing more “sampling” than taking photos and nearly had to take the spoon away as I was hovering over the container with crazy wolverine eyes. This stuff is that good and it doesn’t taste healthy, vegan, or gluten-free one bit! So, so pleased.


","Place coconut and almond milk, xanthan gum, cocoa powder, vanilla, and sugar in a blender and blend until well combined. Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate until chilled through - at least a couple hours.Once chilled, pour into pre-chilled ice cream maker and use according to directions. (Alternatively, pour into a freezer-safe container, cover and freeze, taking out to stir every couple hours to aerate.)Once the ice cream is at soft-serve consistency, add in brownie chunks. You can either do this at the end of the ice cream maker's churning process, or once you pour it into a container. Smooth the top with a spoon, cover, and freeze until firm. Or eat immediately though it will be quite soft."
817,Date-Sweetened Horchata | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Date-Sweetened Horchata

It’s almost Cinco de Mayo! Yahoooooooooo!

Did you ever celebrate Cinco de Mayo growing up? Though I’m nearly full German and part Swedish,I did have the pleasure of celebrating this super fun holiday in many a Spanish class throughout my high school and college years. While I never fully understood some of the traditional cultural practices surrounding holidays like Dia de los Muertos, I totally got behind the celebration of Mexican heritage on May 5th. Plus, it was a great excuse to overindulge in horchata, pastries and grilled corn on a stick! Ay ay!


The thing about horchata is, it’s incredibly sweet and usually loaded with sweetened condensed milk and refined sugar. But, health nuts should rejoice because you can still indulge in this refreshing summer beverage without going into a sugar coma thanks to one little healthy ingredient: dates.



This horchata is very simple to make and requires just 5 ingredients, in true minimalist style. Not including the time it takes the rice to soak, it comes together in less than 20 minutes tops. And the result makes it so worth the effort. Creamy, 100% vegan horchata with hints of cinnamon and vanilla, and perfectly refreshing on a hot day.

I enjoyed my first glass over ice but fully intend on making a horchata cocktail out of the remaining batch. Watch out – boozy horchata inspirations are on their way! In the meantime, Happy Cinco de Mayo!

","Soak rice in 2 cups very hot (not boiling water) for 2 hours (amount as original recipe is written // use 1/3 of the total water if altering batch size). The rice should be soft but still very raw - you should be able to snap a piece in half with your fingernail without much effort. Drain and add to a blender.Add 4 cups water (amount as original recipe is written // use 2/3 of the total water if altering batch size), dates, vanilla, and the cinnamon stick, top with lid and cover with a towel to ensure it doesn't splash. Blend for about 1 minute until the date specks are very small and the mixture seems well combined. It doesn't have to be 100% pulverized.Scoop out a small sample with a spoon to test sweetness. If it's not sweet enough, add more dates (or honey if not vegan).In two batches, pour the mixture over a bowl or pitcher covered with cheesecloth, a nut milk bag, very thin towel, or a clean t-shirt or clean pair of panty hose (a tip I learned from My New Roots). I wrapped a rubberband around my bowl to ensure it didn't come loose, but this isn't necessary.Strain the mixture until only pulp remains in the cloth, squeezing to get every last drop out. It will take a little effort depending on how pulverized your pulp is. Rinse out cloth and set aside for washing.Next, stir in almond milk (optional), whisk and transfer to mason jars or a large beverage container with a lid. Chill and serve over ice. Will keep in the fridge for several days."
818,Date-Sweetened Apple Pie Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Date-Sweetened Apple Pie Oatmeal

Sometimes I get in breakfast ruts, making the same smoothie or pancakes over and over and over again. These last two weeks it’s been this date-sweetened apple pie oatmeal. Remind me again why ruts are a bad thing?



I am so incredibly smitten with dates. Have you tried them? I love how they’ve replaced my need for brown sugar in oatmeal. They’re sticky, sweet, and so satisfying. Cut up into steamy oats and they add the perfect amount of sweetness my sugar-loving palate needs.

The apple pie version actually came about by accident. I’d grown quite fond of making a berry compote version but ran out of berries. In my desperation I turned to apples. Honesty, because I was in a hurry the first time I sliced up my apple and microwaved it for convenience (I can almost hear people slinging enzyme-laced insults at me from afar). But you could also saute your apples to keep this process au naturel.
In this recipe I baked them. But if you’re short on time make modifications as you see fit (like the microwave). Just don’t tell the enzyme fairies.

I love, love, love this bowl. It’s thick, creamy, warm and full of apple-cinnamon flavor. I usually top mine with toasted pecans, which I highly recommend. But in a pinch I used walnuts instead. Just one serving is so satisfying and always keeps me full ’til lunch with plenty of fiber and protein. You could even add a dollop of almond butter or other nut butter for extra protein, if you wish.
I enjoy my oatmeal on weekday mornings since it’s become part of my daily routine. But it would also be a lovely breakfast to make for guests or lazy weekend mornings – the best kind of mornings in the history of weekends.
Sub out other seasonal fruits as well! I love strawberry, mixed berry andblueberry versions as well.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and toss apples with lemon juice, cinnamon and honey. Bake for 5 minutes then roll over parchment paper and tuck it in so they're in a ""pocket"" to trap in moisture. Cook for 10-15 minutes more (20 minutes total) until soft. Set aside.In a small saucepan over high heat, add oats, pinch salt, water and almond milk and stir. When it comes to a boil, reduce to low-medium heat and cook until thick and creamy. Add the chopped dates a few minutes after you reduce the heat so they can soften and sweeten the oats.Once thick, remove from stove top. Add a little almond milk if it's too thick for your liking.Arrange 1/3 cup baked apples in bottom of a serving bowl and top with oats. Other toppings may include, nuts, nut butter, flaxseed, honey, maple syrup, or cinnamon. I prefer mine with a few toasted pecans and flaxseed."
819,Fudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake

I remember watching the movie Matilda as a child and being both jealous of and disgusted by the little boy who was forced to eat chocolate cake as punishment for a petty crime he didn’t commit. The glory was raised up on a pedestal – so thick, decadent and fudgy. I wanted to be right there along with him, fork in hand, shoveling in bite after bite as the crowd cheered “Bruce, Bruce, Bruce!” (and Dana, Dana, Dana). But we don’t get everything we want as a child, just like I never got that fancy notebook Penny always carried around in Inspector Gadget. I had a rough childhood, clearly.

But when you grow up you realize many things, like kids really don’t get punished in real life with chocolate cake, it will feel better when it stops hurting (so said my late grandfather), and eating mass amounts of cake will get you nowhere good (so says my mother). But the funny thing is, despite having this realization, the craving for chocolate cake (and lots of it) doesn’t go away. It’s simply accompanied by a guilt fairy that flutters around your head saying “Fatty McFatterson Two Face,” as you shovel in colossal bites.

My solution? Make the cake healthy with things like banana, avocado, honey and oat flour.Then you can flick the fairy away and say “Nuh uh, stupid face. It’s health food.” Problem rectified. Ugh, I hate bossy fairies.



This cake is the fudgiest chocolate cake you’ll ever have and I don’t say that lightly. The first bite in I thought, ‘Did I cook it long enough?’ But then as the texture and flavors rolled across my tongue I knew I’d done something right. Twelve feverish bites later I knew I’d done something very right. This gluten free chocolate cake will fool even the pickiest eaters into thinking it’s loaded with sugar, butter, flour, and eggs.


The texture of this cake is so, so fudgy thanks to the banana and avocado, whose flavors go completely undetected. Honey adds just enough sweetness, and oat flour and gluten-free flour make it slightly spongy and light. We all know what cocoa powder does – it makes it taste like fudge. Hence the name “Fudgy Chocolate Cake.” Oh good glory.

I contemplated frosting but one bite in and I knew it was like frosting and cake in one! Trust me – just a dusting of cocoa powder is all you need…unless you want to add a scoop of vanilla bean or coffee ice cream. That, I suppose, would be acceptable.



","Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and butter an 8 inch round baking pan (or 8x8 rectangular pan // adjust pan size if altering batch size) with vegan butter. Toss with some white rice flour (or other GF flour) to coat the edges and remove excess. Set aside.Add avocado and banana to a large mixing bowl and mash.Add honey (or maple syrup or agave), vanilla, coconut oil and stir. Measure out almond milk and toss in the vinegar. Let set for a minute or two then add to the mixture and whisk.Next add baking soda and powder and mix vigorously to combine.Add cocoa powder, salt, gluten-free flour blend, and coconut flour to a sifter (reserving oat flour since it's more coarse) and sift over wet ingredients. Whisk vigorously to combine.Last, add oat flour and stir once more. Taste a bit to see if it needs more honey. Then pour into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.Bake for 40-48 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cracks on the top are fine and actually good. The edges should be pulling away from the sides just slightly.Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 1 hour. Then, loosen the sides with a knife and place a plate on top and gently flip over. Repeat with another serving plate so it's right-side up. Dust with cocoa powder (optional) and serve immediately. Refrigerate if keeping longer than a few days. Freeze for even longer storage. Frosting is really not necessary. It's very rich and fudgy on its own."
820,Green Tea Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Green Tea Coconut Ice Cream

So I’ve been on this cleanse that doesn’t allow me to have sugar, dairy, or gluten (among other things.) You know I have a sweet tooth – hence the name minimalist BAKER? Well, to say the least, it’s been a STRUGGLE. A fruitful, eye opening struggle, but a struggle nonetheless. So what’s a cleansing girl to do when she has a mean ice cream craving? Make a super healthy substitute that’s perfectly acceptable in moderation. Still trying to get the whole ‘moderation’ part down, but I’ll give you an update after my next ice cream recipe (next week!).

This recipe turned out far better than I expected, considering that it contains no dairy or refined sugar. Rich, full-fat coconut milk and unsweetened almond milk marry together to create a thick, creamy base. Honey and dates add a natural sweetness. And green tea provides both vibrant color and flavor.

This recipe is customizable if you don’t have dates or prefer not to use honey, if you’re vegan. You can sub raw sugar, and you can omit the dates altogether and replace them with honey. You can also cut the sweeteners back for a less-sweet, more vibrant green tea flavor. The cool thing is the batter contains no eggs so you can dip your finger in and taste it as you go. Also, no heating required – just a blender or food processor. Simple simple simple. But you must – MUST – use high quality coconut milk, not the generic kind that’s $1 cheaper. It won’t be nearly as ice creamy. I went for an organic brand and you can tell it’s high quality when you open the can because a thick almost 3-inch layer of coconut cream has settled over the milk portion. That’s when you know it’s the good stuff.

I loved how present the green tea flavor was, almost earthy and grassy at moments. It reminded me of a recent trip to a sushi restaurant when they brought out fried green ice cream for dessert, only mine is healthier. Sorry, but it is.

","Place coconut milk, almond milk, matcha, dates, and honey in a blender and blend until well combined. Add xanthan gum and mix again. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more green tea powder, dates, or honey.Transfer to a mixing bowl and let chill for at least a few hours. Then pour into a pre-chilled ice cream maker and operate according to manufacturer's instructions.Once finished churning you can either eat it as soft serve or transfer it to a freezer-safe container and let harden for 4-6 hours.Be sure to set out 20-30 minutes before serving to allow to soften.If you don't have an ice cream maker, simply pour the ""batter"" into a freezer-safe container, cover, freeze, and stir/whisk every hour or so to aerate.Will keep in the freezer for a week or so. Best when consumed fresh. I'm sure it would be lovely with pomegranates, fruit compote, or cacao nibs."
821,Better-Than-Restaurant Falafel (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Better-Than-Restaurant Falafel (Vegan &amp; Gluten-Free)

I’ve been waiting patiently to share this recipe with you guys and I can’t take it any longer. On a total whim, I somehow crafted a falafel recipe that’s better than any version you’ve likely had at a restaurant. Unless it was in Greece, then I’ll give you a pass. But the best part? It’s vegan, gluten free, and chock full of healthy ingredients.

I started with collard greens, a green I was completely unfamiliar with prior to this recipe. Next I added in chickpeas, sea salt, pepper, garlic, fresh lemon juice and tahini. The funny thing is, I was aiming for more of a “veggie fritter” but one bite in and I knew it was falafel heaven all the way.

As always, ingredients are simple and to the point and minimal equipment is required: a food processor and 1 pan. They also come together in about 30 minutes. Hello easy, healthy weeknight meal.

I made up one big batch last week and I’ve been having one or two here and there as a quick snack or easy lunch. I’m gluten-free right now for a cleanse I’m doing(a story for another day), but these would go fabulous tucked inside fluffy pita with lettuce, tomato, and a creamy garlic sauce. I just know it. Otherwise, they’re fantastic on their own with just a spot of hummus.

These little guys are amazing, andI don’t use that word lightly! I am so surprised at how healthy and simple they are, yet how packed with flavor they are. They are crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender on the inside, and loaded with bursts of lemon, garlic, and tahini in each bite. I highly recommend serving these with freshly made hummus – my favorite homemade recipe – or they’re delicious on their own. Simply don’t pass up this recipe! It’s one of my most proud kitchen accomplishments to date.

","Add collard greens, chickpeas, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper to a food processor and mix to combine (see photo).Once well incorporated, transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in oat flour 1 Tbsp at a time until the mixture is thick enough to handle – about 3-4 Tbsp (as original recipe is written).Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added more salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and a touch more tahini.Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil at a time. Swirl to coat pan.Add 4 falafel (or however many will fit very comfortably) to the pan at a time.Check at the 1-2 minute mark to ensure they’re not browning too quickly. If they are, slightly reduce heat. Flip once deep golden brown – about 3-4 minutes.Cook until the underside is golden brown as well.Serve immediately with hummus and paprika or inside a pita with garlic sauce or hummus.Will store in the fridge, layered with parchment paper in an airtight container for 4-5 days. Freeze up to 1 month."

Oh hey there. How has your week been? If the answer is good, bad or ugly, I bet you’d still take a drink, no? If so, you’re in the right place. John makes a great bartender.

I have just the cocktail for you. It’s one that John made me a few weeks back on a random Saturday afternoon at the request of “something grapefruity and lime-ish,” and I’ve been pining after it ever since. Freshly squeezed grapefruit and lime juice, two types of booze, and a touch of tonic water for a bubbly effect. Mmm, bubbles.


Simple cocktail perfection is what I like to call it. Or, you could call it a grapefruit lime spritzer. Your call. The grapefruit adds plenty of sweetness while the tart lime offsets it perfectly, and I don’t say that loosely. PER-FECT-LY. The booze doesn’t hurt, either. Just sayin’.

Magazine reading, TV watching, dinner party, evening in for one (or two). These are are just a few occasions this drink would be perfect for. Personally, I preferred the magazine reading, but do what you will. I won’t judge.

","Add grapefruit juice, lime juice, vodka, triple sec, and ice cubes to a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously to combine.Add ice to serving glasses and then add a Tablespoon or two of tonic water, so the alcohol doesn't settle at the bottom.Next, pour the cocktail mixture evenly into the glasses, leaving a little room on top for more tonic water. Top off with tonic and garnish with fresh slices of grapefruit and lime. Serve immediately. Yum."
823,Gluten-Free Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins

The other night we had a new friend over and I wanted to make something outside of my weekly rotations. This lovely salad from How Sweet It Is caught my eye so I knew it had to be on the menu. While I could comfortably just have a salad for dinner, I didn’t want our guest – or John – to be left wondering ‘what else is there?’ So, cornbread muffins it was. Naturally.

This recipe is adapted from a version Iowa Girl Eats made that I’ve been eyeing for months. In fact, although it’s been in my “bookmarks,” I have neglected to make it until now. I decided to make these gluten-free because I’ve been playing around more with GF recipes lately and was up for the challenge. Go me.

This recipe is super simple and comes together in about 30 minutes. It also requires just one bowl and is healthier than your average cornbread, all things considered.
While there’s still a touch of butter, there’s no box mixes involved, half the sugar is replaced with honey, and it includes a full serving of fruit. (I used pumpkin puree but the recipe calls for applesauce – either will work.) Plus, there’s two jalapeños in there, which I’m told is good for your metabolism. I’ll take what I can get.

I was super pleased with the way these little guys turned out. The texture is super moist, they weren’t too crumbly, and the sweet cornbread-spicy jalapeño pairing was spot on.I actually tried reducing the amount of sugar by half but wasn’t as pleased with the end result. So in that case, I recommend sticking with the 1/4 cup for the best results.
Also, butter and honey on top (while still warm) is an absolute MUST.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C), and line a muffin tin with 12 paper liners OR lightly grease them with non-stick spray or butter (as original recipe is written // adjust number of muffins if altering batch size).Melt butter in a large mixing bowl.Add pumpkin puree (or applesauce), sugar, honey, eggs and whisk to combine.Next add salt, baking soda, 1/2 of the jalapeños (diced, seeds removed // 1 jalapeño as original recipe is written) and stir.Add buttermilk or almond milk and stir again until combined.Last, add cornmeal and gluten free flour blend and stir until combined. If it looks too thin, add a touch more flour. If it looks to thick, add more buttermilk.Pour evenly into 12 muffin tins (as original recipe is written) and top each with a slice of jalapeño (optional), seeds removed.Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let rest in the pan for a few minutes. Then transfer to a plate or bowl for serving.

824,Apple Carrot Beet Ginger Juice | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Juice Without a Juicer: Apple Carrot Beet Ginger Juice

By now I’m sure you’ve heard all the cool kids are juicing. Joy the Baker does it. Shutterbean does it. And so doesEdible Perspective. Pretty much all my favorite blogging buddies. Although I don’t have a juicer myself, I’d still like to think I’m a cool kid, too.

Juicing is basically a quick way to get loads of nutrients into your body at once. Hooray for health! The catch, though, is that the juicing mechanisms themselves can be super pricey and take up a lot of room in your kitchen. Because we try tokeep our kitchen equipment to a minimum, both for space and cost purposes, I don’t see us investing in a juicer any time soon. But that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy fresh juice in the meantime.

To make this super tasty apple, beet, carrot, ginger juice, I simply blended it all up in a blender and then pressed it through a fine mesh strainer until I got all of the juice out. Then, I discarded the pulp and enjoyed my juicy juice.
This may sound like a bit of work, but it’s really quite simple. It doesn’t take much more effort than it does to rinse say quinoa or fresh fruit. Plus, not buying a juicer saves you money and a bit of space in your kitchen. Not to mention, I hear juicers are a headache to clean after using. See? Things are working out for us already.


This juice is slightly sweet and perfectly balanced, with some serious kick from the ginger. If you’re not a ginger person I’d recommend either scaling it back or omitting it altogether. I, however, enjoy ginger both for its zing andhealth benefits, so I used a good amount. But play with the ingredients to get a taste you prefer; that’s part of the fun anyway.
Besides being delicious, this juice is also incredibly healthy with Vitamins A, K and beta carotene from the carrots, vitamin C and polyphenols from the apples, antioxidants and folate from the beets, and anti-inflammatory benefits from the ginger (among others). Some of the nutrients remain in the pulp, but all in all it’s a super healthy beverage that’s much better and fresher than store bought.
This was my first try and I intend to experiment with more flavors. Have any suggestions? I’d love to know.

","Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, adding a splash of apple juice if needed to get it moving. I probably added about 1/4 cup (amount as original recipe is written).Then, place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the juice over. Use a rubber spatula to press the pulp down and squeeze all of the juice out. Let stand for 5 minutes so you get most of the juice.Discard pulp and pour your juice into a serving glass. Drink immediately or chill for a bit. Will keep in the fridge for a day or so, but will taste best when fresh."
825,Vegan Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins for 2

Sometimes, you need a whole pan of lasagna for dinner guests. Other times, you need just one square of chocolate for a solo indulgence. And sometimes, you needtwo muffins – one for you, and one for another (_______ &lt;- insert: husband, friend, boyfriend, guy it’s complicated with, random neighbor, landlord still waiting on your rent, teacher who doesn’t like you. You get the idea). These muffins are for just that.


I’m not an expert on gluten-free baking (yet), but I’m getting there! I relied on a gluten-free flour blend my friend shared with me and it performed quite nicely. However, if you aren’t gluten-free, simply sub all-purpose or whole-wheat pastry for an equally stellar muffin.(In case you’re dying to know, it’s3/4 cup brown rice flour, 1/4 cup potato starch, 2 Tbsp tapioca flour, 2 Tbsp white rice flour.)


These muffins are made of simple ingredients and require just one bowl (thanks to a little trick I share). From start to finish they take a little more than 30 minutes, and are ready to eat right away. I could hardly stand letting mine cool before digging in.

These babies are moist, sweet and very blueberry-y. I will disclaim that the gluten-free flour gives these a slightly crumbly texture, as it doesn’t absorb liquid like all-purpose. But, if you’re a gluten-free eater, I’m sure you’re more than familiar with this concern. With that being said, I’d recommend loading these babies up with as many blueberries as possible so you get an equal muffin:blueberry ratio. That’ll clear that crumbly texture issue right up.

I absolutely adored how simple this recipe was, how big and flavorful the muffins were, and how I didn’t have tons of leftover muffins to pass out. I don’t do well with leftovers; something I’m working on.
Plus, it makes the perfect romantic breakfast treat for 2, something us empty-nesters appreciate in this season of life. If you’ve got more mouths to feed, simply double or triple the recipe. It’ll work just the same.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and lightly butter two small ramekins with non-dairy butter.In a liquid measuring cup, add flaxseed and water and set aside.In a large bowl combine flour blend, brown sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk.To the liquid measuring cup, add almond milk, vanilla, melted butter and stir. Add to dry ingredients and stir until combined. If batter appears a bit too thin, add another Tbsp or so of flour.Toss the blueberries in 1-2 Tbsp of the gluten-free flour blend so they don't settle to the bottom when baking (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then fold them in to combine.Divide batter evenly into the two ramekins – about 1/2 to 3/4 full – and sprinkle with a few more blueberries. If using a standard muffin tin, it will likely make 3 or 4 (amount as original recipe is written).Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick or knife inserted comes out clean.Let cool for a few minutes, then remove from ramekins and serve warm. A little vegan butter would make the perfect addition, but not necessary. Will keep in an airtight container for a couple days. Freeze to keep longer."

It seems ludicrous to make your favorite recipes just once, but when you’re a food blogger sometimes you don’t have time for repeats!But, after making asimilar version of these black bean brownies a couple years ago I couldn’t help but try them again. They’re fudgy, sweet, and still one of the best brownies I’ve had to date. Never mind they’re loaded with fiber, omega-3s and tons of other good-for-you ingredients.


Just last week I attempted a vegan gluten free brownie recipe that was a total flop. They didn’t set at all and sort of remained “soup” in the pan. So disappointing. The worst part? I’d wasted an entire bar and a half of my favorite dark chocolate and a descent amount of Earth Balance in the process. Not cheap, not cheap, not cool.
Then I thought, “Why would I make unhealthy brownies if I could make healthy ones that I know I love?” See, I do reason sometimes, especially when it comes to dessert.


These brownies are ridiculously simple to make. They require a handful of ingredients you likely have on hand, and all you need is a food processor (or a blender) and a muffin tin. Does clean up get much easier than that? Let me answer that, NO.



Besides being simple they’re insanely delicious. The edges have a slight crispness and the inside is all fudgy, chocolaty goodness. Plus, you don’t have to dirty a knife cutting into them – they’re already baked into bite-size deliciousness. How convenient!

Enjoy these plain, with some vegan ice cream, dunked in almond milk, slathered with peanut butter or topped with fresh berries (credit to my smart friend Arleigh for the berry idea).
Better yet, I have another idea for these beauties coming up next week. Wish me luck! In the meantime, bake these brownies and tell no one what’s inside…until they’re three bites in and begging for the recipe. Hooray for healthy deception!

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Lightly grease a 12-slot standard size muffin pan (not mini // adjust pan size if altering batch size). Make sure you've rinsed and thoroughly drained your black beans at this point.Prepare flax egg by combining flax and water in the bowl of the food processor. Pulse a couple times and then let rest for a few minutes.Add remaining ingredients (besides walnuts or other toppings) and puree - about 3 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. You want it pretty smooth.If the batter appears too thick, add a Tbsp or two of water and pulse again. It should be slightly less thick than chocolate frosting but nowhere close to runny.Evenly distribute the batter into the muffin tin and smooth the tops with a spoon or your finger.Optional: Sprinkle with crushed walnuts, pecans or chocolate chips.Bake for 20-26 minutes or until the tops are dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides. I found mine took about 25.Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes before removing from pan. They will be tender, so remove gently with a fork. The insides are meant to be very fudgy, so don't be concerned if they seem too moist - that's the point. Plus, they're vegan so it doesn't really matter.Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. Refrigerate to keep longer."
827,Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes and Gravy | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes with Mushroom Gravy

Creamy mushroom gravy.

Fluffy cauliflower mashed potatoes.

The two together make the perfect pair.

I’ve always loved mashed potatoes and gravy but the kind that I like are surely artery clogging. Not so with this recipe. It’s completely vegan, heart healthy, and packs three servings of vegetables. Plus, it’s so easy to throw together, requiring about 30 minutes total, that it’s perfect for fancy weeknight meals and special occasions alike. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, this would be great alongside grilled corn and perhaps a lentil or tofu-based entree. I preferred mine with grilled chicken. But really, it would pair well with just about anything mashed potatoes do.

What do they taste like? The mashed potatoes with cauliflower are light and fluffy, and the mushroom gravy is the hearty, flavorful sauce that melds it all together. I think I’m in veggie heaven.

","In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a low boil and cook until a knife inserted slides off easily.In the meantime, add the cauliflower to a strainer or veggie steamer and place on top of the potatoes in the saucepan to cook at the same time. Cover with a lid to steam.Once both are soft and cooked through, transfer to a bowl and mash with a potato masher, adding salt and pepper and 1 Tbsp of vegan butter to season (amount as original recipe is written // use 1/3 total amount of butter if altering batch size). Set aside and cover to keep warm.In a skillet over medium to medium-high heat, melt the remaining vegan butter (2 Tbsp as original recipe is written). Add the shallot and mushroom and cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Cook until the mushrooms are soft and brown, and most of their liquid is evaporated.Stir in the flour with a whisk and reduce heat to medium. Cook for another minute or two.Slowly add veggie broth while whisking to reduce clumps. Then add in the thyme and whisk again.Reduce heat to simmer and continue to stir until it reaches desired thickness – about 5-10 minutes. If it appears too thin, add a touch more flour and whisk. If it’s too thick, add more broth.Season with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Serve over cauliflower mashed potatoes. Store leftovers in the fridge in an air-tight container for up to a few days."
828,Orange Thyme Jam (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Orange Thyme Jam

Some mornings call for nothing less than a biscuit, loads of butter and homemade jam. I believe I have just the jam for such an occasion.


This jam was inspired by the rustic jams I buy for John and me to use on toast, sandwiches, and such. I’ve wanted to make homemade jam for a while but was always intimidated by the process. Some require fancy jarring equipment – perhaps an investment I’ll make in the future – others pectin, and I just wanted something simple, as usual.


The ingredients list is modest and affordable, and there’s only 1 bowl (or pot, in this case) required. And though it’s a bit more time intensive at about an hour, it’s well worth the effort. The result is a refreshingly light, “springy” jam that’s perfect for warmer weather and all of the delicious food it brings with it. I’ve already slathered mine on waffles, fresh baked bread and on top of cream cheese toast – the latter being my absolute favorite. Somehow the tanginess of the cream cheese pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the jam. I think I’m in love.

Of course, if you’re not an orange person, simply sub another fruit. Strawberries, persimmons, blueberries, blackberries, and apricots would work lovely here and perform similarly as far as preparation and consistency. I have a feeling I’ll be making a lot more homemade jams come summer. I simply can.not.wait.



","Bring oranges, orange juice, lemon juice and sugar to a low boil in a large saucepan over medium to medium-high heat, stirring frequently to combine.Once it reaches a low boil, reduce heat to medium low and add a pinch of salt and stir. Simmer for about 30 minutes and then add thyme and orange zest.Continue cooking until the mixture is reduced by about a third. It should be thick and syrupy - be patient as the whole process may take up to an hour. Add a bit more sugar to help it thicken even more.Once thickened, remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to clean jars and store in the fridge. Will keep for a couple of weeks. To store in freezer, make sure to use freezer-safe canning jars to avoid cracking."
829,Bleu Cheese Bites with Balsamic Reduction | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whipped Bleu Cheese Bites with Balsamic Reduction

Hey! I made a super simple appetizer that will trick all your friends into thinking you’re a gourmet chef – seriously.
I’m sharing the recipe hereand over atIowa Girl Eats this week! Check out Kristin’s post for the full story behind the recipe and lots more photos. Plus, I share a bit about how Minimalist Baker came to be, so if you’re new to our siteventure over to get to know us better. We’d love that.

This recipe falls in the minimalist category for its 10-item ingredient list and 30-minute preparation time. Super simple, super delicious, super perfect for springtime patio parties. Enjoy!

830,My Favorite Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Favorite Green Smoothie

There are a lot of green smoothie recipes out there, and I’m sure they’re all awesome in their own right. But this? This recipe is my absolute favorite and one I drink almost daily.

I know I share a lot of dessert recipes around these parts, but I do, for the most part, eat a very clean diet. I try and incorporate fruits and vegetables into every meal. Things like meat, refined grains, heavy sauces, and cheese are consumed in moderation. Dark chocolate is my only daily indulgence. And if I haven’t had leafy greens in more than 12 hours, I kind of start to hyperventilate. In other words, I love a raw brownie every once in a while, but for the most part, whole foods are where it’s at.

Enter this green smoothie. The ingredients are simple and affordable: almond milk, peanut butter, banana, mixed berries, flaxseed and spinach. And it literally takes 2 minutes to prepare. I love that it sends me out the door with up to 3 full servings of fruit and veg in the mornings, leaving me less pressure to consume two huge salads for lunch and dinner to get my veggie count in. Plus, I love all the fiber it contains, how it has a salty-sweet balance, and how it keeps me full ’til lunch. Really, it doesn’t get much better to me than having a giant green smoothie for breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack.

Though I’ve tried other varieties, this one is my favorite because I can stuff as much spinach in there without affecting the flavor one bit – which, for the record, tastes like a creamy peanut butter banana shake. Hello dream smoothie.
Play around and make this smoothie your own. Sub almond butter for peanut butter, try coconut milk instead of almond, all blueberries instead of mixed, another leafy green in place of spinach. But do try the original just once and see if you don’t fall in love it like I have. I won’t be offended if my favorite becomes your favorite, too. In fact, I’d be elated. Here’s to health! (And regularity ;) )

","Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until creamy, adding more almond milk or frozen berries (or bananas) to thin/thicken, respectively. Serve immediately or freeze to enjoy later. Although it is best when fresh."
831,Boozy Pecan Pie Bars with Sea Salt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Boozy Pecan Pie Bars with Sea Salt

pecan pie + booze = better pecan pie. it’s science.

I’m at it again with raw desserts. I really can’t get enough. Why would I have butter- and sugar-laden desserts when I can have one with 5 wholesome ingredients that makes 10 minutes to make and it tastes just as good? My thoughts exactly.

These pecan pie bars are ridiculously easy to make. Simply soak your dates in a little bourbon, then whirl them up with some raw almonds and pecans. Vanilla extract adds a caramel-y sweetness, which balances out the savory bite the sea salt provides.

Ooey-gooey, caramel-y pecan pie bites with a hint of sea salt and a serious kick of bourbon. This is a “healthy dessert” I can get behind.

For those who would prefer a less boozy bar, I’ve included a variation sans bourbon as well. You know, for the morning hour, post workouts, children and the like. They’re honestly both fantastic, so don’t feel like you need the bourbon to enjoy this flavor bomb of a dessert.

","If making with bourbon, start by soaking your pitted dates in bourbon. I recommended 1/3 cup (as original recipe is written), but just use enough to cover your dates when pressed down firmly into a shallow bowl. Set aside and soak for 15 minutes.In the meantime, add your almonds and pecans to the food processor and blitz until only small bits remain – nearly a fine meal.Add in vanilla extract and a healthy pinch sea salt and pulse a few times more to disperse throughout.Next, turn onto mix and drop in dates one at a time until a dough forms. It should take all of the dates. In the case that it doesn’t you can simply transfer the dough to a parchment lined 8×8 dish, place the remaining dates in the food processor and pulse into small pieces, and add them into the dough.Press pecan pie dough down until uniformly flat, using another piece of parchment paper to flatten if needed. Top with another pinch of sea salt.Pop in the freezer for 15 minutes to set, then remove and cut into 12 equal squares (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for up to a week. I prefer mine in the freezer and pull them out 15 minutes before serving.To make the version without bourbon, simply add your dates to the food processor and process until small bites remain. Then add in almonds, pecans, sea salt and vanilla extract and mix until a dough forms, adding more dates if too dry. Transfer to a parchment lined loaf pan and press down until flat. Top with another sprinkle of sea salt. Pop in freezer to harden for 15 minutes, then cut into 6 equal squares (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Store in fridge or freezer for optimum freshness."
832,Sweet Potatoes + Warm Spinach Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dill Roasted Sweet Potatoes + Warm Spinach Salad

I’m all about sweet potatoes. Sweet potato fries, chips, pancakes, waffles, muffins.You name it I’ve tried it and probably loved it. But when my brilliant friend Alina had John and I over for dinner a few weeks back she served us sweet potatoes like I’d never had before: roasted in fresh dill. Friends, I’m never going back to plain again.

This recipe is so simple yet lends itself to a number of different serving options. You could serve it at a side, add a protein during the roasting process such as chicken thighs, whip it up for breakfast alongside eggs, or use it as a frittata “crust.” The options are endless, and all delicious.

The recipe is also quick and easy. Simply dice up sweet potatoes with skin on, as well as some white onions and then toss it all together with olive oil, whole garlic gloves, a crack of salt and pepper and a load of fresh dill. Let it get roasty toasty for about 40 minutes or so and then do with it what you will.

I opted to toss mine over a bed of spinach and added a handful of toasted walnuts and bleu cheese. I was in warm salad heaven.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Lightly spray with non-stick spray.Rinse and scrub sweet potatoes and remove any dark spots. Then dice into 1-inch cubes and add to a large mixing bowl.Dice onion into rings and add to the bowl as well, along with the garlic cloves. Add olive oil and toss. Then season with salt, pepper and dill and toss again until well coated. Add to baking sheet in a single layer (use more baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size).Bake for 35-45 minutes or until soft and potatoes slide off a knife or fork with ease. Remove from oven and serve immediately. I added mine over a bed of fresh spinach and topped it with bleu cheese and toasted walnuts for a comforting warm salad. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for several days, or in the freezer for a month."
833,Peanut Butter Eggs (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Eggs

I may have lost my mind with all of this chocolate peanut butter business lately, but I haven’t forgotten that it’s almost Easter. And what better way to celebrate than with chocolate (and peanut butter)? See! I do know what’s going on! Tell John; he’s concerned…


After making thePeanut Buter M&amp;Ms last week (by the way, a MUST try) I couldn’t resist testing a recipe for peanut butter eggs. Growing up my sister and I always had candy on hand during Easter, making it one of the holidays most prone to sugar highs. (Thanks, Ma!) And everyone knows peanut butter eggs are where it’s at. I mean, seriously. Cadbury who?
However, I’d like to think I’ve turned a new leaf and no longer indulge in “cheap candy.”Instead, I make my own and must say it’s way better than the super processed junk both in flavor, freshness and health. Make a batch of these PB eggs and see for yourself. I bet you a giant chocolate Easter bunny that you’ll never go back to the original again (OK not really, but, you catch my drift. These eggies are bomb).


These eggs are so luxurious and the perfect way to celebrate Easter (or unwind after a long, stressful day like some of us *ahem* do). The center is perfectly salty and moist and the dark chocolate shell envelopes the PB center perfectly. The two together? Too satisfying for words and crazy addicting, which probably explains why they’re all gone and it’s not even Easter yet. Boo-hooooo.
Guess it’s off to make some more! Weeeeee!

","Add dates to a food processor and process until only small bits remain. Next add almonds and peanuts to the food processor and mix until they turn to meal – a few small chunks are OK.Next add peanut butter in 1 Tbsp at a time (8 Tbsp total as original recipe is written) until the mixture forms a loose dough. If it seems too wet to handle, add more peanuts. If it seems too dry, add more peanut butter. Refrigerate for 5 minutes so it's easier to shape.Scoop out large rounds of dough - heaping 1 Tbsp - and form into an ""egg"" shape. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and pop in the freezer to harden for about 20 minutes.In the meantime, melt your dark chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave in 30 second increments. Then work in small batches to coat the ""eggs."" Take just 1 egg out of the freezer at a time for dipping - otherwise they'll get too soft to dip well.To dip, drop eggs one at a time into the chocolate, flip once, pick up with a fork and gently tap on the rim of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. A little excess is OK. Place back on the parchment-lined baking sheet and pop back in the freezer to set.Repeat until all eggs are dipped, re-warming chocolate as needed.For optimum freshness, store eggs in an air-tight container in the freezer or fridge until serving."
834,Vegan Gluten-Free Oatmeal Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Oatmeal Waffles

It’s the end of our spring break here and we had big ambitions to go on a fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants trip to the Grand Canyon last weekend with two other couple friends. But, as the date approached life happened as it does and nobody planned, so we ended up calling the whole thing off.Instead, we opted for a casual brunch at our flat last Saturday morning. Honestly, it was perfect: Relaxing, delicious, connecting – just what we all needed. The Grand Canyon will have to wait for another day, and that’s OK with me. Sometimes brunch trumps road trips.

It isn’t brunch without waffles. Don’t ask questions.
We have two friends who are gluten-free and I wanted everyone to feel included and well fed, so I scoured around for a GF waffle recipe. It was a total test that ended up a success. However, they didn’t really have any flavor, whole grains or tenderness. So, after brunch ended I made it my personal mission to come up a recipe better than the original. I believe I’ve done just that. Even John approved, and he’s a waffle hater! ( &lt;—- eewww.)



Look at that stack of glory! The recipe is simple, as always: One bowl and under 30 minutes. It does include a few gluten free flours but I found mine easily and affordably at a local market and can almost guarantee you can, too. If you’re a GF eater, you likely already have these on hand. And if not, just sub in the same amount of all-purpose or whole wheat flour for a similar result (although some modifications may have to be made for consistency sake).


What do they taste like? Awesome in the mouth.
Tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, and lightly sweet with a hint of vanilla. Plus, they have plenty of good-for-you ingredients like flaxseed, rolled oats and agave nectar. They were delicious right off the waffle press, and almost more delicious frozen and re-heated the next day in the toaster. The perfect kind of waffle, if you ask me.


Let’s be real, it isn’t a waffle without toppings. I went with a little vegan butter, strawberries, banana, and maple syrup. But these would also be excellent plain, with a few chocolate chips, or with peanut or almond butter. Long live the brunch waffle!

","Combine almond milk and vinegar in a large liquid measuring cup and let set for a few minutes to curdle/activate. Then add melted butter, vanilla extract and agave nectar and whisk. Set aside.Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. Let set for 10-15 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. (I set mine to 4 out of 5 for a crispier waffle, but adjust yours according to preference.)Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or vegan butter and pour on about 1/3 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions and then remove and place on a baking rack in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm. Do not stack and instead keep them in a single layer to ensure crispiness remains.Serve immediately with desired toppings. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results. Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple months, although they're freshest within the first couple weeks."

So, you remember those peanut butter stuffed no-bake bites we made? OK.
Do you remember how we had leftover PB dough from the batch? OK.
Well, we’re gonna need that now soo ahead and get it. I’ll wait…


OK seriously, how have I not done this before? I did make peanut butter patties and this is a very similar concept, only you roll the peanut butter dough up all teeny tiny and dip it in chocolate! Whoopeeee! Fresh Peanut Butter M&amp;Ms are way better than the packaged kind.

If you didn’t make the no-bake bites and don’t have any of the PB dough on hand, worry not! It’s so simple to throw together. You simply need oats, dates, peanut butter, raw almonds, and roasted peanuts. Then comes melted chocolate – a VERY important element, clearly.


These M&amp;Ms were SO so so so delicious. I offered them up at a recent party with friends and they got snatched up before the fancy dark chocolate squares did. They’re also no doubt healthier than their candy-coated counterparts and arguably better. The only problem? What’s a serving size? I mean really…who eats just FIVE M&amp;Ms? If that’s you. Get out of here. This recipe isn’t for you ; )
I’m more of a1015 M&amp;M girl myself.

836,No-Bake Cookie Dough Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Cookie Dough Blizzard

Remember those Peanut Butter Stuffed No-Bake Cookie Bites we made last week? Yeah, we’re gonna need those again.

I have been a blizzard fan for as long as I can remember. Who isn’t, really? But I still recall the day I learned that my favorite blizzard – the banana cream pie topped with mounds of whipped cream – had 60 grams of sugar in a small. A small! That news caused me to steer toward a “mini” from then on.
Since goingmostly dairy-free at the beginning of the year, I’ve been having major blizzard cravings that I just can’t shake.Enter: the No Bake Cookie blizzard that just happens to be vegan and gluten free. Oh joy.


This little masterpiece is quite simple to throw together. You just need two ripe, frozen bananas, a healthy scoop of peanut butter, a splash of non-dairy milk and you have your base. Next, drop in a no bake cookie bite or two, give it a few more pulses, and you have bits of no bake cookie “dough” throughout a creamy peanut butter banana “blizzard.” Sound good? Yeahtrustmeitis.

This baby is legit. It’s:
Smooth, creamy, and perfectly sweet from the banana
Slightly salty from the natural peanut butter
Fudgy from the bits of no-bake cookie dough dispersed throughout
&amp; Completely vegan and gluten-free
It kind of goes without saying, but it’s practically health food. Yipee!

","Add your bananas, peanut butter, and non-dairy milk to the blender and blend until thick, creamy and smooth. Start out with less milk to ensure you achieve a thick texture. Then add more to ensure that it all blends evenly.Once blended, drop in two no-bake cookie bites and give it two more pulses to loosely mix.Pour into serving glasses, and top with another crumbled no-bake cookie bite (optional). Serve immediately."

Remember my 4-Ingredient No-Bake Cookie Bars? Yeah, they’ve been revived and made into a PB-stuffed truffle. Sound good? Trust me, they are.


The concept for this recipe came after a serious craving for no-bake cookies, and I decided to make a batch of my no-bake cookie bars and roll them into balls. After a taste, I decided they needed a bit more saltiness, so I dipped them in peanut butter.
Enter thought: oh my goodness they need a PB center. The rest is history.


Despite looking somewhat complex, this recipe is actually quite easy to make. I simply whipped up a batch of my peanut butter pattie dough and a batch of my no-bake cookie bars and then rolled the two together!


The result was a no bake cookie truffle with a salty peanut butter center. These could certainly pass as a healthier dessert, snack or pre- or post-workout bite as they have the perfect balance of carbs, protein, and sweet.
Also, I have one more idea for how you could consume these, but you’ll have to wait until the next post to see what it is…

","To make the PB centers, add your oats to the food processor and mix until small pieces remain. Then add dates and process again until only small bits remain.

Then add dates and oats back in and process until the mixture forms a loose dough. If it seems too wet to handle, add more oats. If it seems too dry, add a few more dates.Scoop out small handfuls of dough and form into small balls - about 1 tsp. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and pop in the freezer to harden for 15 minutes.In the meantime, prepare your ""no bake cookie"" shell by pulsing dates in a food processor until only small pieces remain; about 15 generous pulses.Add oats, chocolate chips and peanut butter and mix until well combined. You want there to be consistently small pieces but not overly processed.Fetch a few of your PB centers from the freezer at a time and scoop out enough no bake shell to cover them - about 1 Tbsp. Flatten the no bake cookie dough and then drop a PB center on top (see picture). Then carefully form the no bake shell around the pb center, adding more no bake layer as needed. Slightly wet your hands to help them stick and form into a ball. You will have leftover PB center.Place back on cookie sheet and pop back in the freezer for 15 minutes to set.

Hey, guess what? There’s cauliflower in there (underneath all the cheesy, onion-y goodness). Health food for the win!

I’ve been wanting to experiment with cauliflower for a long time but it’s always scared me with its funky appearance and distinct texture and flavor. So until I figure out how to eat cauliflower on its own, I shall pair it with potatoes. Not a bad combo if you ask me.

These twice baked potatoes have about 1/3 of a cauliflower inside, but you really can’t tell. The texture remains the same as a traditional twice baked potato, with just a slight taste of fresh, steamed cauliflower.

What you need to know about this recipe:
– It’s super simple, requiring just 7 ingredients.
– It can be made dairy-free by using dairy alternatives to butter, sour cream and cheese.
– It makes a seriously satisfying side dish, or with the addition of chili on top, could be a complete meal.
– It’s cheesy, dense and extremely flavorful.
– Although I have no subjects to test on (yet), I bet kids would love these.

I served mine alongside some grilled chicken and steamed broccoli and carrots, but they would also go well alongside hearty soups, meat entrees or dinner salads. And, they reheat really well, so make a few ahead of time and then snack on them throughout the week.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Wash and scrub your potatoes. Then dry and lightly coat with oil. Place directly on the top or middle rack and bake for 1 hour, 15 minutes, or until they’re golden brown and have a bit of “give” to them when lightly squeezed.Remove from oven and let cool until they’re comfortable to handle.In the meantime, steam your cauliflower over a double boiler (or in the microwave) for about 15 minutes or until tender.When your potatoes are cooled, cut them in half and gently scoop out the insides with a spoon, leaving about a 1/4 inch rim. Add the potato and steamed cauliflower to a large mixing bowl, along with the butter, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sour cream and combine with either a potato masher or hand-held mixer. Be careful not to overmix or the potatoes can become sticky. Add a splash of milk if it appears too thick.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Scoop the filling back into your potatoes and place in a baking dish. Top with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese (optional) and bake for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are warmed through.Serve immediately, topping with chives or green onion (optional). Cover and store in the fridge for up to a few days."

I’ve been wanting to experiment more with gluten-free recipes since I have a few friends that eat gluten-free, and I am wanting to shy more away from it myself. These cookies are a result of that desire, and although they were kind of an experiment, they turned out so good I simply could not stop eating them (as in “6 cookies in 1 day” kind of good).

My ingredients are simple: Peanut butter, banana, coconut oil, agave nectar, almonds, and flaxseed. To keep them gluten-free, I opted for GF oats, oat flour, and almond meal. And what kind of cookie would they be without chocolate chips? That’s what I said…


These cookies have some of the heartiest ingredients I know and love, making them more like a healthy snack than a true cookie. But I’m really not much of a butter-and-brown-sugar type of cookie girl anyway, so these suited my fancy much more.


What you need to know about this recipe:
-It requires just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes
-It’s refined-sugar- and butter-free
-It’s vegan and gluten-free
-It’s makes the perfect take-along breakfast or snack
-They’re seriously addicting… Temember my 6-in-1-day comment?
Yeah, ridiculously tasty.


I loved that these cookies were delicious right out of the oven and seemed to become even more delicious after they’d cooled. They became a bit more soft and banana bread-like. Even John had a few, and he’s not much into health food hippie cookies. Success!

840,Sweet Potato Almond Butter Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Almond Butter Muffins

If you haven’t learned by now that I’m into crazy flavor combinations, see items a, b, and c. Convinced? OK, let’s move onto the flavor bomb that is sweet potato-almond butter. Huzzah!

I first discovered my love for sweet potato and almond butter after seeing a fellow blogger slather peanut butter on her baked sweet potato. I tried it and loved it, then tried it again with almond butter and just a dab of honey. I was kind of blown away and have been addicted ever since. The salty, sweet plays so well together andit makes a surprisingly satisfying and healthy meal (super simple lunch, anyone?).
These muffins and these flavors were just meant to be together, there’s no getting around it.

I made sure to keep the ingredients list as slim as possible, as well as the cooking time and equipment required. From start to finish these beauties take about 35 minutes and require just one bowl. All of this equals less time and less mess in the kitchen. Double win.
So how do they taste? Awesome. They’re incredibly moist – almost bread pudding-like in the center. And they’re quite hearty, salty and sweet with just a hint of sweet potato and a fleck of almond butter in every bite.
I’ve been heating mine up in the mornings alongside a veggie omelet, or grabbing one for a quick snack in the afternoon. I didn’t share any of these with friends but am somehow already down to one. ONE, lonely guy. Looks like I’ll have to get back out my one mixing bowl and do this whole laborious (wink, wink) process over again. Wanna join? Please say yes; I love baking with friends. Please, please, please, please…..

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line muffin tin with paper liners.Prepare flax egg in a large mixing bowl and let set for a few minutes.Add sweet potato puree, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla extract and mix. Then add almond milk and stir once more.Carefully place whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon into a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Then add oat flour on its own (as it does not sift well in my experience) and stir until just combined.Spoon batter into muffin tins until filled almost to the top. Then drop about 1 tsp almond butter onto the center of each muffin and gently swirl around with a toothpick or knife.Bake for 20-22 minutes (or more) until golden brown and a toothpick in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and let rest in tins for 5 minutes. Then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool completely.Cool completely or they will not come off the wrapper well. Store in an air-tight container and refrigerate to ensure freshness. Will keep in the freezer for up to a few weeks."
841,Vegan Dessert Nachos with Coffee Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Dessert Nachos with Coffee Ice Cream

Rarely does a dessert get me so giddy that I can’t stop blurting out “epic!” while taking photos. Well, somewhat rare. Desserts do get me all sorts of excited.
So you remember how I made coconut coffee ice cream a while back? Well I had just a few scoops leftover, but I knew I wanted to do something awesome with them. Then a recent Food Network show I’d seen a while back flashed across my mind and I thought “Dessert Nachos!” My plan was set. Now I just needed to gather my materials and execute – hard.
Imade my tortilla strips looks like Battlestar Galactica! Kinda… Clearly I was having fun.

Important tip though: I tried TWO kinds of tortilla chips – one whole grain and one gluten free.
It turned out the gluten-free ones worked better! But if you really want to throw caution to the wind, white tortillas would be best because they’re so fluffy and buttery. But I did like how the gluten-free tortillas got crispy and shiny and became the perfect vehicle for scooping up coffee coconut ice cream. Oooooh mama.

These nachos are so decadent and delicious. Reminds me of sitting down at a Mexican restaurant and devouring fried ice cream.Crispy, cinnamon sugar-coated tortilla chips make a bed for hefty scoops of coffee ice cream and a stream of chocolate syrup.

Wait a minute or two until the ice cream gets all melty and then start digging in, using the chips to scoop up bites of ice cream and chocolate sauce. And don’t forget a strawberry (or cherry) on top – desserts need dressing up too, you know?

This would make the perfect dessert to share with your sweetheart or a group of friends. Just add more chips and ice cream to compensate for more mouths.

","Turn your oven to low broil and position a rack in the top 1/3 of your oven.Cut tortillas in triangles, place on two lightly greased baking sheets and lightly coat with avocado oil (or other oil).Add cinnamon sugar and toss again to coat, adding more cinnamon sugar as needed.Arrange tortillas in a single layer on baking sheet and broil for 1-3 minutes on each side, being careful not to burn as they turn from crisp to burnt quickly. They should take about 2 minutes each side.Remove from oven and arrange on a large plate. Top with coffee ice cream, drizzle with chocolate sauce and top with strawberry or cherry. Serve immediately."
842,Vegan Banana Nut Muffin Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Banana Nut Muffin Pancakes

Oh yes. It’s a banana nut muffin inside a pancake. Don’t ask me how I did it. I’m still a little unsure.
First, I started with a mashed banana. Mash, mash, mash. Isn’t this fun?

Then we added some wholesome partners in crime including flax seed, walnuts, almond milk, and whole-wheat pastry flour. Although those eating gluten-free could substitute a gluten-free blend or oat flour and likely achieve similar results. I also added a bit of streusel because the blueberry muffin pancakes(seriously, best ever)performed so swimmingly with the addition. Ooh, la la.
Also, these cakes are vegan, come together in about 20 minutes, and require only 1 bowl. Huzzah!

The result?
A wholesome, hearty vegan pancake with no added sugar besides a dash of raw sugar in the streusel mix.
They aren’t the fluffiest pancakes I’ve ever made but that’s OK, because they taste just like a banana walnut muffin.
Woohoo! Friends, we have officially re-entered breakfast heaven.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Prepare streusel by combining sugar and flour in a small mixing bowl and then cutting in Earth Balance until well combined. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes or until it turns light brown. Remove from oven and set aside. You will have leftover streusel.Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 350 degrees F), or a large skillet on the stove top. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot – oil shouldn’t smoke when it makes contact with the surface.To the same large mixing bowl you used earlier, add mashed banana, baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, flaxseed and water and whisk until well combined. Let set for a couple minutes.Add melted Earth Balance and almond milk and stir.Next add flour and stir until just combined. If your batter appears too thin, add a bit more flour, or if too thick, add almond milk. Let better rest for 5 minutes.Lightly grease your griddle and pour 1/4-cup measurements of the batter onto the griddle.Top with a sprinkle of streusel and walnuts and flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges turn slightly dry.Cook for 1-2 minutes more on the other side and then top with an additional sprinkle of streusel, walnuts and a drizzle of maple syrup (optional)."

844,Sweet Potato Coconut Curry Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Coconut Curry Soup

I don’t know why but curry has always scared me. Where do I buy it? How do I use it? What does it taste like? Is it going to spice my face off?
Sadly, these questions were all too accurate. That is, until I tried a few curry dishes and started doing some down and dirty curry research. I quickly discovered there’s nothing to be scared of with this colorful spice. And I now plan to use it abundantly.

Curry is typically a blend of spices that comes in a variety of colors and flavors and even consistencies. You can buy curry paste, curry powder, red, yellow and green curry, just to name a few. And each seems to be best suited for a certain type of dish. Yellow tends to be the mildest of the curries and green the spiciest. Yellow curries get their bright yellow hue from turmeric, green from cilantro and coriander rot, and red from red chilis.
With all of these considerations, curries can be made more spicy or mild, depending on the curry base and how much heat is added in the form of chilies and peppers.

Now that we have a basic understanding of what curry is, how do we use it?
Curries are most heavily employed in Thai and Indian cooking, and this soup is a fusion of the two, relying on yellow curry powder (Indian influence) and coconut milk (Thai influence. I prefer spicy dishes, so I added some chipotle powder to this soup. But I think cayenne would work well here, too (used in moderation). I didn’t have access to red chili at the time or I likely would’ve tried adding it to the mix.Next time. There will certainly be a next time.

Let’s talk soup.
This soup is luxuriously creamy.
Comes together in about 35-40 minutes, and requires just 1 pot ( + 1 bowl and baking sheet is making chickpeas).
Is naturally sweet from the sweet potatoes and coconut milk.
Spicy from the garlic and chipotle powder.
And surprisingly filling, thanks to the addition of crunchy, spicy baked chickpeas.
The flavor also comes in waves, first savory, then sweet, then “whoa, this is spicy.” If you prefer it less spicy, simply add less chipotle (or cayenne) powder, or omit it entirely. I just felt that it needed some heat to balance out the sweet potato and coconut milk.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Then start the soup by sweating the onions in a large pot over medium heat in 1/2 Tbsp coconut (or olive/avocado) oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Cook for a few minutes and then add garlic and stir.Season with 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper and stir (amount salt/pepper as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add sweet potatoes, curry powder, chipotle (or cayenne) and stir.Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.Add 1/4 tsp more salt and pepper and the coconut milk (amount salt/pepper as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then cover.Bring to a simmer and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 25 minutes more.In the meantime, prep your chickpeas by tossing them in olive oil and spices and spreading evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. Remove and set aside for serving.At the end of 25 minutes, taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added about 1/4 tsp more salt and a pinch more chipotle (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then puree using an immersion blender, food processor or blender. Transfer back to the pot if needed and keep heat on low until ready to serve.Will keep in the fridge for several days and the freezer for a month or so."
845,Toasted Coconut Mocha Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Toasted Coconut Mocha Frappuccino

I remember going grocery shopping with my friend Lisa once and we pulled over to the in-house Starbucks to grab a drink before the hot and heavy produce picking commenced. Lisa is one to indulge when she’s earned it, eating a plate of alfredo pasta if she made it to her morning spin class. Effort = reward; I like it.

On this particular day she ordered a luxurious looking coconut mocha frappuccino with piles of whipped cream, toasted coconut and chocolate syrup dripping down the side. I jealously watched her slurp it down and she must’ve caught on because she offered me a few sips, saying she couldn’t finish it all by herself (though I believe she probably could’ve). How generous.
Oh my, it was heavenly.Consider this my healthier homage.

This beverage is so simple to throw together. Simply freeze coconut milk into ice cubes, toast up your coconut flake, then add it all to a blender with a little chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and strong brewed coffee. Oh dear. Takes me right back to the grocery store, only this time it’s all mine.

","The night before making, pour your (well-shaken) coconut milk (about 1 can as original recipe is written) into an ice cube tray. You'll need 8-10 cubes for one drink, and one can yields about one full tray. Save the leftover cubes for another drink.In the morning, toast your coconut by spreading 1/4 on a baking sheet and baking for 3-5 minutes in a 350-degree F (190 C) oven.Next place all ingredients in a blender and mix until smooth and well combined.To thicken, add more coconut ice cubes. To thin, add more coffee or chocolate syrup.Serve immediately, or freeze for later. Top with coconut whipped cream, more toasted coconut and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, if desired. Nutrition does not reflect toppings."
846,Roasted Beet Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Beet Hummus

Isn’t health beautiful? Why yes, it is.
After my first go with beets last month for my fudgy beet cupcakes, I had a couple of extra roasted beets I was hungry to use up in my fridge. I was also making a batch of hummus that week. Clearly the solution was beet hummus.

I was a bit afraid of taking my first bite, now knowing it the beet would be too overpowering or altogether gross. But it was stupid delicious. The lemon, garlic and olive oil helped temper the flavor of the beet perfectly.
It wasn’t just me who liked it. I shared it with John and several friends and they all agreed it was spot on. Friends, behold – Roasted Beet Hummus.

What you need to know about this here hummus: It’s:
HOT pink.
Lemony with a kick of garlic.
Super creamy and flavorful.
Full of vitamins and minerals.
&amp; Perfect with pita or veggies or as a spread.
It’s also very simple to make. Once you have a roasted beet it’s a matter of throwing everything into a food processor or blender and whisking away. It also keeps for about a week in the fridge, making it the perfect weekday lunch solution or take-along snack.

","See roasting instructions here.Once your beet is cooled and peeled, quarter it and place it in your food processor. Blend until only small bits remain.Add remaining ingredients except for olive oil and blend until smooth.Drizzle in olive oil as the hummus is mixing.Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt, lemon juice, or olive oil if needed. If it’s too thick, add a bit of water.Will keep in the fridge for up to a week."
847,Chipotle Sweet Potato Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Sweet Potato Chips

Here’s the deal. I like spicy. I like sweet. Marry the two together and I about flip my lid. That’s what happened when I took a bite of these here chips.


I’ve loved making sweet potato chips so much that this is my third go at it. First, I did plain, then I did DARK CHOCOLATE (what? so good), and now we’re turning up the heat with chipotle powder. Can I just say sweet potatoes and chipotle pepper were made for each other? Ooh, what if we threw dark chocolate in the mix? Don’t even get me started…

These chips are super simple to throw together. You just chop up your sweet potato, toss it in olive oil, sea salt, chipotle pepper and a bit of brown sugar and bake away. Depending on how crispy you like they should only take about 30 minutes. I like mine a little on the crispier a.k.a. charred side. I know, char causes cancer, so said my college Cancer Perspectives and Controversies professor. But I don’t care none. Mama likes her char. Plus he gave me a C+ in that class, so I don’t give him much authority in my life anyway. Char for life!
I tried dipping my chips in almond butter and ohmygosh it was delicious! But they’re honestly great just on their own, like, for a snack. P.S. follow me on instagram if you want to see my lunch, and stuff. You won’t regret it, probably.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Wash and scrub sweet potatoes. Then, thinly chop with a knife getting them as uniform as possible. The thinner and more consistent they are the more evenly/quickly they’ll cook.Place potato slices in a large bowl and toss with olive oil. Then add salt, chipotle, and brown sugar and toss again until well coated.Transfer potatoes to two lightly greased baking sheets (or more // use even more sheets if increasing batch size) and arrange in a single layer.Bake for 30-45 minutes, flipping once around the 20-minute mark. You’ll know they’re done when they’re browned and crispy. Be careful not to burn as they turn pretty quickly.Leave out to cool completely, even overnight. And do not bag until then. Otherwise, they can lose their crisp."
848,Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches

It’s raining today. I made an early trip to the grocery store this morning before things got damp then made myself breakfast: eggs, toast, and fruit.
John poured me coffee and I settled into my familiar dent in the couch to soak in the wisdom and wit of Anne Lamott. Her book “Traveling Mercies: Thoughts on Faith,” is one of my favorites to date.

One of her best lines came in a chapter on parenting when she found herself struggling to let her then 7-year-old son go paragliding off a big mountain. Tofly like “a baby eagle” as she put it. In her indecision she reflected on prayer.
“Here are the two best prayers I know: ‘Help me, help me, help me,’ and ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you.’ A woman I know says for her morning prayer, ‘Whatever.’ And then for the evening, ‘Oh well.'”
I love this. What more can you do besides be open to whatever comes in the morning and then be OK with whatever happened at night?

I’m still sitting here, sipping on the coffee as the rain ticks on our big, east-facing windows. Feels like a true Saturday to me, the type you can savor and smile at.
I got John to eat chia seeds this morning over his fruit salad. It’s the little victories. He said they looked like “ants” on his oranges and apples, but in the end he didn’t mind.
What does this have to do with ice cream sandwiches? Not a lot, but I did read “Traveling Mercies” this morning and I ate an ice cream sandwich last night. Does that count? Also, I ate one a few nights ago while watching “The Biggest Loser.” I’d have felt worse if these weren’t borderline health food.I suppose these just make good lazy activity snacks.


What you need to know about this recipe:
They’re vegan, creamy, cappuccino mocha-y.
The chocolate “cakies” are made with oat flour, coconut oil and raw sugar.
I shared the coconut coffee ice cream earlier in the previous post.
They make excellent late night “snacks.”
You need to let them melt a little bit before eating. Otherwise, the flavors aren’t as present. (microwave for 20 if you must)
They would be delectable dunked in dark chocolate. (why didn’t I do that?)
They’re overall very simple to make.


","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and lightly coat a baking sheet with non-stick spray.Prepare flax egg by mixing flax and water in a large bowl. Set aside.Measure out almond milk in a liquid measuring cup and add vinegar. Let set for a few minutes.Add the sugar, melted coconut oil and vanilla to the flax egg and beat.Add almond milk and beat again.Add remaining dry ingredients to a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Beat until well combined.Add chocolate chips and fold in until just combined.Spoon 1 Tbsp measurements of batter onto the greased baking sheet (leaving a small space in between cakies) and spread around and flatten a bit - you don't want mounds, but rather discs.Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, let set on tray for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Once cooled, pop cakies in the freezer to harden so they're easier to work with.In the meantime, set your ice cream out so it begins to soften - about 15 minutes.Once soft, use an ice cream scoop to scoop out 8 large balls of ice cream onto squares of plastic wrap (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Fold the plastic wrap around the balls and squash them into thick discs. Twist off tops to cover and place back in the freezer to harden - about 30 minutes.Once frozen, remove chocolate cakies and the ice cream discs from the freezer and carefully plop the ice cream on the top of one cakey (face down) and then top it with another cakey (face up). (SAVE the plastic wrap).Use both hands to carefully press the cakies together around the ice cream, then place in a baking dish, re-wrap with squares of plastic wrap, cover with a lid and pop back in freezer.Will stay fresh for up to a week."
849,Coffee Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coffee Coconut Ice Cream

So the no-dairy thingis going OK. I’m feeling better each time I opt for dairy-free alternatives, and I’m actually starting to crave my swig of almond milk in the mornings after my obligatory almond butter, banana toast.
I still cannot believe I haven’t had ice cream since December 2012. This is unheard of. But thankfully with options like cinnamon toast ice cream and now this coffee variety, my sanity is still intact, I haven’t strangled anyone, and my sweet tooth is somehow satisfied. Thank the Lerrrd.
This recipe is incredibly simple to throw together, requiring just four ingredients and very little hands-on prep time. I snagged my friend’s ice cream maker again, but it’s not necessary (though it makes it oh so creamy and fluffy). I’ve shared a few tips below if you’re sans-ice cream maker.

The texture of this ice cream is so creamy, the vanilla adds a lovely cappuccino flavor, the bold coffee is offset by the sweetness of the coconut milk, and it’s only slightly sweet thanks to a reduced amount of raw sugar. You can, of course, add more sugar if you like, but I prefer my coffee ice cream like I prefer my coffee – as close to black as possible. Modify as you see fit.

I almost added chocolate chunks or a fudge swirl to this recipe, but I figured I’d be a purist with this first coffee test batch. Watch out, though. More adventurous concoctions are sure to come soon, especially as the weather warms up.

","Combine coconut milk, coffee, and raw sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk until well combined - about 5 minutes.Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla. Transfer to a bowl to let cool completely in the fridge - at least 6 hours, overnight being preferable.Transfer to ice cream maker and prepare according to manufacturer instructions. Once done either eat immediately or transfer to a freezer-safe container and let harden for several hours. Should keep for 1 week in the freezer. Let stand for 15 minutes at room temperature before serving."
850,Vegan Berry Pop-Tarts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Berry Pop-Tarts

If I were to speculate, I’ve probably eaten around 250 Pop-Tarts in my lifetime. And not the kind with the baby zebra on the box with no sugar added, whole fruit, wheat crust, and no frosting. WHO EATS A POP-TART SANS FROSTING? That’s what I wanna know.
No, the kind I consumed were of the brown sugar cinnamon, strawberry, cherry, or wild berry variety with the purple frosting with blue swishes across the front. My mom would toast two up, slather them in I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, and carry them downstairs to me, where I’d inhale bites between strokes of mascara and lip gloss before school. Now THAT’S how you eat a Pop-Tart, kids.
That is, unless you’ve turned a new leaf and no longer consume high fructose corn syrup, blue lake dye, andhydrogenatedoils. See where I’m going with this?

Yes, healthy Pop-Tarts. That’s what we have here.


I’ve tried to make Pop-Tarts before with Greek yogurt or whole wheat flour in the crust to slash calories, but let’s be honest: They tasted like sand.
So this time, I wised up. I used Earth Balance and whole-wheat pastry flour and kept my fillings as simple as can be – pure fruit compote.
Friends, we have a winner.


These glories are vegan and fairly simple to throw together, requiring just 7 ingredients and about 45 minutes of your precious, precious time. After all, who would actually make Pop-Tarts if they took 5 hours to prepare? Not I, and neither should you. You deserve better than that. We deserve better than that.

You will love these Pop-Tarts.
The crust is flaky and buttery (despite using vegan butter).
The filling is tender, fruity and naturally sweet.
The raw sugar on top provides a delightful crunch.
And the optional vegan vanilla glaze sends me straight back to my childhood, sans GMOs.
Gah, life is good again, thanks to healthified Pop-Tarts.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Prepare the compote by placing berries in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes with a lid on, stirring occasionally and smashing down with a spoon. Add a few teaspoons of sugar to sweeten if desired. I added 1 tsp. raw sugar (amount as original recipe is written). Transfer to a bowl to cool.To prepare crust, mix flour and salt in a large bowl, then cut in butter with a fork or pastry cutter until well combined.Using a tablespoon, drizzle cold water over the mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until it starts to form a dough. I added 2-3 Tbsp - you may need to add up to 5 Tbsp (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). It should be moist enough to form into a ball, but not too sticky to knead. Add more flour if it gets too wet.Turn onto a floured surface, shape into a disc, and then use a rolling pin to roll into a large rectangle. I find it helpful to place a sheet of plastic wrap over the dough while rolling to reduce cracking.Cut into 12 equal squares (not rectangles) and carefully transfer each to the baking sheet (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Place about 1 Tbsp of filling onto half of the squares (6 as original recipe is written), leaving a 1/4 inch border to seal the edges. Then use your finger to dot water around the edges so the two squares stick together. Top the squares with their matching halves and then seal lightly with a fork.Poke a few holes in the top of each, rub a tiny bit of vegan butter on top of each, sprinkle with raw sugar, and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.Let cool for a few minutes. Then top with glaze if desired. Not necessary, but recommended for sweeter Pop-Tarts."
851,Peanut Butter Flaxseed Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Flaxseed Pancakes

I love pancakes. But I don’t love how they can sometimes leave me feeling like I just ate an entire loaf of bread. Do you ever feel that way? This must be a symptom of getting old(er). But we can fix that.
One grain that doesn’t leave me feeling sluggish is oats! That’s why I’ve based this pancake with oat flour instead of all purpose, because it’s healthier.

For starters, 1/2 cup of oat flour has 80 fewer calories and 20 fewer grams carbohydrates than 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. They’re also high in iron, magnesium and fiber, and contain the amino acid lysine, which promotes replenishment of body tissues like muscles and nerves – this makes them an excellent food staple for fitness junkies. Oats can also help lower cholesterol levels and help us feel fuller longer. Seriously, super power food in the house.
To make oat flour you simply process oats in a coffee grinder until a fine powder remains. You can also buy it at the grocery store (gluten-free optional) or make a big batch at home and store it in your pantry for quick mornings breakfasts like these pancakes.


These pancakes are so simple to make: Just 1 bowl and 15 minutes required. You could even make them with other nut butters if you have a peanut allergy.
More importantly they’re fluffy, filled with good-for-you ingredients, and packed with some serious peanut butter flavor. I topped mine with a little peanut butter sauce (just peanut butter whisked with very hot water) and a little maple syrup. But they’d also be great with sliced bananas, honey or jam (hello PB&amp;J).

These will definitely be my new go-to pancakes since I always have the ingredients on hand and they’re perfect even for busy weekday mornings. So excited to share these lovely cakes with you. Hope you enjoy.


","Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 350 degrees F / 176 C), or a large skillet on the stovetop. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot – oil shouldn’t smoke when it makes contact with the surface.To a large mixing bowl add flaxseed and water and let set for a minute or two. Then add melted Earth Balance, agave nectar, peanut butter, baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract and whisk to combine. Add almond milk and whisk again until well combined.Next add oat and whole wheat pastry flour and stir until just combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.Lightly grease your griddle and pour scant 1/4 cup measurements of the batter onto the griddle. There should be 6 pancakes (as original recipe is written). Flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges turn slightly dry, being careful not to burn.Cook for 1-2 minutes more on the other side and then top with Earth Balance or more peanut butter and a light drizzle of maple syrup, or whatever else you please.Will reheat well the next day in the microwave."

Hey, hey, hey it’s tomato soup! With its buddy roasted red pepper. Oh, they’re going to hit it off so well, I just know it.


I’d never made tomato soup before – I know. What the heck? But I fixed that this week.
In the midst of some chilly winter weather I had serious a craving for grilled cheese and tomato soup, so I got to work. The recipe is inspired by one I found in the Sprouted Kitchen cookbook, only it’s a vegan version with the addition of roasted red pepper.

10 ingredients and simple seasonings – you likely have everything you need on hand right now. If you’ve never taken the leap and made your own tomato soup, now is the perfect time to do it. Besides, you already have a grilled cheese to use as a spoon. A big, cheesy, delicious spoon.
This soup can be made as intensely flavorful as you wish by simply adding more garlic, salt and pepper, fresh herbs and/or additional tomato paste. It can also be made more rich by adding real cream. I opted for almond milk to keep it dairy free, but I can imagine the real stuff would send it over the top.
I loved how filling and satisfying it was and am excited that I now have a go-to tomato soup recipe as it’s one of my favorite winter dishes. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Cut tomatoes and onions into wedges and remove some of the tomato seeds with your fingers. Remove seeds from red pepper and cut into even slices.Place all of the veggies, including the garlic, on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, a generous pinch of sea salt and black pepper and toss. Roast for 40-45 minutes, or until the veggies are tender, lightly browned and close to half their original size. Remove from oven and set aside.In a large pot over medium to medium-high heat, add canned tomatoes, veggie broth, tomato paste, the slightly-drained vine-ripened tomatoes and the roasted veggies. Add another pinch of salt and pepper, stir and bring to a low boil.Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Then use an immersion blender, food processor or blender to puree your soup (leave some whole veggies if you prefer more texture).Return to pot and add plain almond milk (and more broth if it’s too thick for your liking). You can also sub cream or regular milk.Cook for 5-10 minutes more on medium to medium-low heat and serve warm.Optional garnishes: pesto, oregano, parsley, roasted red pepper flake, vegan parmesan cheese, basil, garlic croutons. Will keep in the fridge for several days."
853,Fudgy Vegan Beet Cupcakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Beet Cupcakes

Before you say anything bad about these cupcakes, have you tried my chocolate covered sweet potato chips yet? Because if you have then you know I know a thing or two aboutdesserts– just sayin’.


I’ve been wanting to put beets in my dessert for a while now, seeing as they pair so well with chocolate. But none of the recipes I’d seen before were vegan, so I knew experimenting was a must. If you haven’t been previously warned about beets, consider this your official warning. They, are, messy.

After a roast in the oven beets get all soft and juicy and perfect for adding to things like cupcakes because they don’t have a particularly offensive flavor and add a ton of nutrients and moisture to baked goods.
Beets may be unsightly – and stain your hands pink – but they’re extremely healthy for you. Loaded with vitamins A, B and C, they’re also high in fiber, manganese, folate and are a rare source of phytonutrients called betalains, which have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification qualities (find out more here).
All of that goodness inside these cupcakes? Who would’ve thought?


Now of course, that doesn’t meant you should eat cupcakes instead of beets. That just means you should eat beets and have an occasional cupcake. Trust me, I tried to reverse this information but the health food gods didn’t seem to want to budge. I’ll keep trying on both of our behalf, though.

What you need to know about these cupcakes:

They require one bowl
They’re vegan
They really don’t need frosting
They’re rich, moist and cakey
They are fudgy and addictive
They don’t taste like beets
Not one bit

Satisfied? I hope so. Now let’s get to baking.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C), remove the stem and most of the root from your beets, and scrub and wash them underwater until clean.Wrap beet(s) in foil, drizzle on a bit of olive or avocado oil, wrap tightly, and roast for one hour or until a knife inserted falls out without resistance. They should be tender. Set in the fridge (in a bowl to catch juice) to cool to room temperature.Once cooled, either finely grate or puree beets in a small blender (adding orange juice or water to encourage mixing). Measure out 1/2 cup and set aside (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Reserve the rest for things like beet hummus!Line a muffin pan with paper liners.Whisk together the almond milk and vinegar in a large bowl, and set aside for a few minutes to curdle. Add the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup beets (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and beat until foamy.Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to a sifter and slowly sift it into the wet ingredients while mixing with a hand-held or standing mixer. Beat until no large lumps remain.Pour batter into liners, filling 3/4 of the way full. Bake 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely. Do not try and unwrap them or they'll stick to the wrapper.Once cooled, dust with cocoa powder and store in an airtight container to keep fresh."
854,Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard

When you’ve been an ice cream addict like me for 26 years, giving the stuff up is rough. I’d rather endure weaning all over again than try and shake my double scoop habit.
Thankfully though, I’ve found something that satisfies my deepest, darkest most intense ice cream cravings – this Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard that doesn’t contain one lick of dairy.
Oh me oh my. oh.


The base is a spin off of my creamy chocolate breakfast shake, and the brownie should look familiar from earlier this week: my 5-minute espresso walnut brownies. Marry the two together and we have one insanely rich spoonable beverage on our hands.
Dare I say, worthy of the title “blizzard”? Yes, I do.

Just looking at the pictures again I already want another. The base is rich with chocolate flavor and you can’t detect the strawberries one bit. The banana flavor is ever-so-subtle so even if you’re a banana hater I’d still suggest you give it a try.
The no-bake brownie bits melt into the shake seamlessly and get all fudgy and creamy and every bite seems better than the last.
The best part? It really is healthy enough to be breakfast. Sure, there’s a lot of sugar but it’s from all natural sources and there’s no gluten, dairy or unhealthy fats. See, told you it’s perfect for breakfast. Cheers!


","Place all ingredients EXCEPT brownies in a blender and blend until smooth.If you prefer a sweeter shake, add more stevia or agave. If you prefer it thinner, add less ice OR more almond milk.Divide between serving glasses (two as original recipe is written) and layer with brownie crumbles. Serve immediately or freeze, covered for later."
855,5-Minute Espresso Walnut Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Espresso Walnut Brownies

I learned something this week: Cocoa powder isn’t raw, it’s cooked. Therefore, just because a brownie isn’t baked like these fudgy beauties doesn’t mean they’re truly raw. This is good to know.

You see I’ve been learning a lot about whole foods lately. It all started with my stumbling upon Sprouted Kitchenwhere whole foods are tasty, and thenordering the Sprouted Kitchen cookbook.Since then I’ve been treating the thing like it’s my new foodie bible, because it is.
After that profound discovery came My New Roots, which I could rattle on about for hours. But for the sake of being concise, Sarah Britton is a whole foods genius and I want to shrink down to pocket size so I can ride around in her chef coat pocket and learn everything she knows about holistic cooking.
Think she’d mind? (OK, raise your hand if you think riding around in a little pocket would be super fun?!)

Sarah’s taught me a lot about food recently. How medjool dates are best, organic is worth budging for, and cocoa powder is not the same thing as cacao powder, just to name a few.
AsSarahexplains, COCOA (koe-koe) powder is cooked which strips it of 90-some percent of its nutrients. However, raw CACAO (kuh-cow) powder is rife with health benefits like calcium, iron, and beta carotene. And it’s one of the top sources of magnesium found in nature.
So you see, cocoa and cacao are very different things, which is important to know if you’re shooting for optimum health like I am (trying to) these days.

Unfortunately I was not able to get my hands on raw cacao powder before making these no-bake fudgy brownies, so they are not technically raw. But I have just placed an Amazon order for a bag today so the next time raw brownies appear on this blog they will be so healthy they’ll boast too many health benefits to count.
Oh goody.
But in the meantime, if you don’t have cacao powder you can make these brownies. And if you DO have cacao powder you can make them, too. Yours will just be healthier. But don’t go rubbing it in our faces or we’ll come and eat all your brownies. And how would you like that? Well, that’s what you get for gloating…

These brownies may not contain any butter, sugar, or flour, but they are some of the best I’ve had. They are moist, rich, dense, full of intense chocolate flavor and a hint of espresso. The walnut chunks make it, in my opinion, but if they’re not your thing leave them out.
I’ve already eaten half the batch since making them last week and have another healthy recipe utilizing them coming up later in the week so stay tuned. You don’t want to miss this ooey-gooey chocolaty treat.

","Place 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup almonds in food processor and process until finely ground (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Add the cocoa powder or cacao, espresso powder and sea salt. Pulse to combine and then transfer to bowl and set aside.Add the dates to the food processor and process until small bits remain. Remove from bowl and set aside.Add nut and cocoa mixture back into food processor and while processing, drop small handfuls of the date pieces down into the food processor spout. Process until a dough consistency is achieved, adding more dates if the mixture does not hold together when squeezed in your hand.Add the brownie mixture to a small parchment lined cake pan or loaf pan and add remaining roughly chopped walnuts (1/2 cup as original recipe is written). Toss to combine and evenly distribute, and then press down with you hands until it is flat and firm.Place in freezer or fridge to chill before cutting. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh. Will keep in the fridge for at least 2 weeks and in the freezer for at least 2 months."
856,Raw Peanut Butter Patties | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Peanut Butter Patties

Six weeks ago, I was in full-fledged holiday baking mode and my mom joined me one evening for some girl time, Baileys, and coffee and a semi-professional cookie decorating contest. She won, I think, on account of finishing all of her Baileys and half of mine. Touche, Mom. Touche.
Over the course of a few hours we dipped pretzels in chocolate, sprinkled peppermint on chocolate bark and crowned peanut butter blossoms with a Hershey’s kiss. And you know what happened next? I practically ate a dozen of everything.
I think this is the part where I say, “Hi, my name’s Dana and I have…a cookie problem.”

Good news, though. Since then I haven’t inhaled a tin of chocolate bark, licked gobs of frosting off my fingers or made a game of seeing how many white chocolate pretzel sticks I can stick in my mouth at one time (although, now that I mention it, that sounds like an awesome idea).
And it’s not because I’ve had a deep look inside myself and wrestled the will to take control of my raging sweet tooth. It’s because I haven’t had the junk in in my house. It’s that simple. Junk food makes me feel terrible and I’ve been having an increasingly difficult time ignoring my conscience anytime I’m tempted to put something less-than-wholesome in my mouth. (Is this what they call becoming an adult?)
After all, we only get so many meals in a day and I want to make sure all of mine count, for good.

Lucky for me these cookies are full-on wholesome. They’re vegan, gluten free and contain no added sugar. Just dates, peanuts, oats, almonds and dark chocolate. They also match the likeness of a popular Girl Scout Cookie, only without all the partially hydrogenated what have yous and high fructose devil syrups.

This is pure hippie dessert heaven. The centers are tender, peanut-y and slightly salty thanks to salted, natural peanut butter (I made mine from scratch), and have just a hint of sweetness from a handful of dates. You could certainly leave them as is for a healthy snack, or you could cover them in dark chocolate to elevate them to dessert status.


Besides being simple to make, these little guys stay forever in the freezer so you can pop one out any time you want for an occasional treat. Alternatively, they’d make great gifts wrapped up all pretty – Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, after all.


","Add your oats to the food processor and mix until small pieces remain. Then add dates and process again until only small bits remain. Remove from processor and set aside.Next add almonds and peanuts to the food processor and mix until they turn to meal - a few small chunks are OK.Next add peanut butter to the nut meal and pulse until well combined. Then add dates and oats and process until the mixture forms a loose dough. If it seems too wet to handle, add more oats. If it seems too dry, add a few more dates.Scoop out small handfuls of dough and form into small discs. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet and pop in the freezer to harden for 30 minutes.Around the 25-minute mark, melt your dark chocolate over a double boiler. Then work in small batches to coat the cookies. Take only 5 cookies out of the freezer at a time for dipping.To dip, drop cookies one at a time into the chocolate, flip once, pick up with a fork and tap on the rim of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place back on a parchment-lined baking sheet and pop back in the freezer to set.Repeat until all cookies are dipped, re-warming chocolate as needed.For optimum freshness, store cookies in an air-tight container in the fridge or freezer until serving."

I’m sure at this point you’re thinking I’ve totally lost my mind. Well in that case, fair enough. But if I could just reach through the screen and hand you one of these chips, one bite in you’d be singing a different tune. These chips are nothing short of a flavor masterpiece.

Ironically, these chips almost didn’t happen. I was dipping other things in chocolate this week – a recipe you’ll find on Saturday – and at the same moment I was pulling some sweet potato rounds out of the oven for a different recipe. But instead of going ahead with my plan of drenching them in almond butter and honey, I decided to dunk them in the dark chocolate instead.
WIN. One bite, whoa – we’re goin’ all in.


The chips have the perfect amount of crunch thanks to plenty of time spent roasting in the oven, and a touch of saltiness to offset the sweetness of both the potato and the chocolate.
I’m a firm believer in the idea that anything dipped in chocolate is generally a good idea, especially peanut butter things. But sweet potatoes take chocolate dipping to a whole new level. This is one of my best discoveries yet.
Friends, behold the new face of chocolate-covered dessert.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (176 C).Wash and scrub your sweet potatoes clean, removing any areas that are bruised. Thinly slice your sweet potatoes with a knife or mandolin. I don't own a mandolin, so I opted for a large knife. You don't necessarily want your chips paper thin, but rather closer to the width of a quarter or slightly more. If they're too thick they take longer to crisp up in the oven.In a large bowl or on a slightly greased baking sheet, toss your sweet potatoes in oil and then add in sea salt and ground cinnamon. Toss to coat.Arrange your sweet potatoes in a single layer on multiple baking sheets and cook for 30-45 minutes, flipping once or twice to ensure even cooking. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of your chips and how evenly your oven cooks.Twenty five minutes into your cooking time, melt your chocolate over a double boiler or in 20-30 second increments in the microwave. Turn heat to low to keep warm until chips are ready, or re-microwave if it hardens.Once your chips are crisp, remove from oven and immediately dip into chocolate. Set on a parchment-lined surface or a cooled baking sheet to cool.These are best eaten fresh. To store, let cool completely and then place in a bag or container slightly sealed. Putting them in the fridge will cause them to get soggy."
858,Vegan Ginger Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Ginger Hot Chocolate

At first I didn’t think we were going to have a winter this year, which for the record is totally fine with me. I’m more of the sweat over shiver type, even though bundling up in hats and mittens and scarves on top of scarves is one of my favorite pastimes.
But then, one day last week,winter did come and I’m still feeling a bit of a chill because of it. Though it only stayed for a brief moment and it’s already back in the 50s, it was still rough. So rough, in fact, that it required a new hot cocoa recipe. One of the ginger variety as you might’ve guessed.

I have this friend named Lacy who loves ginger candies so much she can eat a whole bag before realizing what happened. She also runs marathons a lot. This is why I think she’s crazy.
Ginger candy. Honestly, I don’t get it. I popped a giant ginger square in my mouth after hearing Lacy loved it so much and I haven’t stopped regretting it since. Ginger has such a strong, spicy flavor, which is why I prefer it as a complementary flavor, not the main squeeze.
After some experimenting I found the perfect role for ginger to play: Ground ginger (or you could sub fresh) went into the hot cocoa itself and a ginger candy was used to line the rim of the serving mug. How perfect. That way every sip has a hint of ginger without being too overwhelming. The result, i think, was quite perfect.

This hot chocolate has a lovely warmth. It’s sweet, creamy and chocolatey and not-too-spicy due to a conservative amount of ginger. But, if you love the stuff like Lacy then by all means, pop a few ginger candies in your mouth while you’re making a batch and throw in a whole teaspoon of ginger instead of half. Go wild, I don’t make the ginger rules, I merely twist them to suit my taste.
I do, on the other hand, write the breakfast rules. Don’t, mess, with my breakfast. You have been warned.

","Heat the milk and water in a medium saucepan. Once it comes to a simmer, reduce heat slightly and whisk in cocoa powder, sea salt and ginger. Whisk vigorously to incorporate.Once the cocoa is hot enough for your liking (about 3-5 minutes), remove from heat and add vanilla extract. Stir once more.Take your ginger candies and rub them along the rims of your serving glasses or mugs. Eat or discard; they get mushy when added to the beverage.Pour in hot cocoa and top with coconut cream, whipped cream or marshmallows - whatever you like."

{In a deep, sexy baritone}
Hey, you.
Yeah, you.
Why don’t you come over here and enjoy a vodka root beer float with me? Sit down, get to know me, ya know?
I know, you’re asking, “why theintroduction?” Andprobably“how do you have such a sexy voice?”
To answer the latter first, born with it.
Responding to the former, well, my name is John. And John doesn’t usually write the minimalist baker posts. In fact, this is my first one.
Usually you get toexperiencethe literary expertise of Dana.
Perhaps regretfully, today’s post willforce-feedyou my tone of voice. Or you can just skip to the bottom to read the recipe. That’s what I’d do.

We like dessert, but we try not to overindulge. What’s that mean? It means when we do dessert, we do it right.
We rarely drink soda, we stopped eating ice cream often, and it’s a special treat to make a cocktail. Solution? MIX ALL OF THEM.
Introducing: Vodka Root Beer Floats!
Since we didn’t want to produce something disgusting, we knew testing would be required.
And test we did. After hours ofpainstaking labor, we founda flavor combination that was pleasing for any palette.
Translation: We mixed liquor with root beer! Hooray for testing!

Our conclusive resultsreturnedthe following:
1) Kahlua – Good, sweet, but fearful it would over power the ice cream flavor.
2) Spiced rum – Extremely good as just a sitting drink, but again, would distract from the sweetness of the ice cream.
3) White rum – Bad idea. Flat out, bad idea.
4) Vodka – BINGO! A subtle, tasty liquor that waltzed with the root beer on my tongue.

Next, we had to locate our ice cream.
Thankfully, earlier this week we made dairy-free cinnamon toast ice cream. Haven’t made it yet? It’s worth it. Get the ingredients, find a friend, and make an afternoon out of it.

These were good. Although they were root beer floats, they were also a cocktail.
Dana delights in anything sweet. She devoured this. The spoon didn’t leave her hand until it finishedscrapingthe bottom of the glass.
I, on the other hand, had the determination to consume the entire drink through my straw. I do the same thing with strawberry milkshakes. The only reward I find is a sore mouth and a two hour eating event. I think it is a pride thing. Regardless, I survived. For you. You’re welcome.
In conclusion: Try our delicious, sweet,cocktailroot beerfloats. We are fans. Big fans.

","Split a can of soda between two large glasses and then add a shot of vodka to each.Carefully drop two scoops of dairy-free ice cream into each glass (we used our cinnamon toast coconut ice cream), and then top off with remaining can of root beer.Slurp, scoop, and enjoy."
860,Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream (Dairy-Free) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream (Dairy-Free)

Waking up at grandma’s house was always slow. My sister and I would be jostled in the sheets next to each other in the hideaway bed in the living room while my mom and grandma carried on quiet conversation in the kitchen.
The sun would start to stream in and we could smell the scent of mediocre coffee with too much cream and equal. When we finally came to we’d take turns in the bathroom doing damage control on our hair and face creases before shuffling into the kitchen. My sister was most often less chipper than I was…I’m a morning person by nature. But grandma’s cinnamon sugar toast always seemed to bring out the morning person in all of us, even the night owls.


After deciding to try a dairy free diet out on January 1, I knew it would be difficult if only for the fact that I would miss ice cream. Whether planned or sporadic, John and I had gotten into the habit of visiting our local dairy/ice creamery at least once every couple weeks to pick up eggs, milk and a double scoop.
It’s now been nearly three weeks since I’ve had ice cream and I was starting to fall off my rocker a little bit, so a dairy-free recipe was a must. I’ve experimented with no-churn recipes before and while they’re great for simplicity’s sake, I knew consistency would be key in a non-dairy version. So I ran downstairs and borrowed my friend Laura’s ice cream maker and two cans of coconut milk later I was in business. The cinnamon sugar toast came inspired by my grandma’s favorite breakfast item and one that I often still crave.


I took a tip from the coconut ice cream queen, Oh, Ladycakes on this recipe and kept it very simple. The result was just what I’d hoped for. Though it did taste like coconut, it was rich and creamy and sweet just like regular ice cream. And I adored how the cinnamon sugar and actual toast flecks gave it a whole new flavor dimension. This isn’t a 1-for-1 trade up, but it certainly did the trick in satisfying my ice cream longings.


","Add coconut milk to a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stir, and bring to a boil. Continue whisking for 1-2 minutes.Remove mixture from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, cinnamon and xanthan gum (optional). Whisk to combine.Transfer to a glass bowl and refrigerate until cooled. I left mine in the refrigerator for 6-8 hours and covered it with plastic wrap once it was no longer steaming hot.Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, transfer it into the bowl of your ice cream machine and mix according to the manufacturer's instructions.Once the ice cream is nearly done - mine took about 35-40 minutes - sprinkle in half of the cinnamon sugar and toast flecks.When the ice cream machine stops, transfer to a freezer-safe container and sprinkle in the rest of the cinnamon sugar and toast flecks, swirling with a knife to slightly incorporate.At this point you can either consume it soft, which was insanely creamy and delicious, or pop it in the freezer to harden. It should keep fresh for about a week. Thaw for 10-15 minutes before serving."

I know what you’re thinking. Is that a pancake in a muffin, a muffin in a pancake? Wha-wha-whaa-what do you call that, a paffin? A muffcake?
Honestly, I don’t know what to officially call these beauties but I do know they are seriously the best pancake I’ve ever created. A fluffy, sweet vegan pancake that tastes exactly like a blueberry muffin. Not lying.
The basis of this recipe is simple. A basic vegan pancake batter with plump blueberries and a lightly toasted streusel topping. From start to finish, they take about 30 minutes, and it’ll be one of the best half-hour investments in the kitchen you’ve ever made.


When I say they taste exactly like a blueberry streusel muffin, I mean exactly. John can back me up on this one.
What’s more? He doesn’t like pancakes – as in nearly detests them – and he ate the entire stack. I gave him a sample bite, and the next thing I knew, he’d run off with them.

These would make a lovely brunch or weekend breakfast item, or something special during the week to lure your kids out of bed with. In writing this post and oogling at the photos once more, I’ve decided to make them again tomorrow. Yes, muffin pancakes for breakfast on a Wednesday – sounds like a brilliant plan to me.


Nutritionally speaking these are a bit on the indulgent side, but if you split the stack in two it’s plenty to satisfy a sweet tooth. I’ve included the nutritional estimate for the whole stack below. Do with that information (and these pancakes) what you will. I’m not judging one bit.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Prepare streusel by combining sugar and flour in a small mixing bowl and then cutting in Earth Balance until well combined. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes or until it turns light brown. Remove from oven and set aside. You will have leftover streusel.Preheat electric griddle to medium heat (or about 350 degrees F), or a large skillet on the stovetop. You want the surface to be hot but not screaming hot - oil shouldn't smoke when it makes contact with the surface. Catch my drift?To the same large mixing bowl add flaxseed and water and let set for a minute or two. Then add melted Earth Balance, agave nectar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, almond milk, vanilla extract and whisk until well combined.Next add flour and stir until just combined. Add blueberries next and lightly fold to incorporate. Let better rest for 5-10 minutes.Lightly grease your griddle and pour 1/4 cup measurements of the batter onto the griddle. Top with a sprinkle of streusel and flip when bubbles appear in the middle and the edges turn slightly dry. Cook for 1-2 minutes more on the other side and then top with Earth Balance, an additional sprinkle of streusel and a drizzle of maple syrup."
862,Ginger Cookies with Orange Buttercream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Ginger Cookie Sandwiches with Orange Buttercream

In the land of cookie sandwiches there are three distinct sizes: the Little Debbie, the tea time, and the fat kid. These, my friends, are the fat kid.

This recipe combines two of my favorite things: Chewy ginger cookies and sweet citrus frosting. Thought they don’t fit my current dairy-free bill, I made them a while back for a party I attended and were mostly devoured by fellow guests. I made some with modest amounts of frosting and others with obscene amounts. Guess which ones went first? OBSCENE. Fat kids are popular, what can I say?

Not only are these cookie sandwiches fun to look at, they’re also quite delectable. Fluffy orange-flavored buttercream makes the perfect glue between two chewy ginger cookies. The flavor combo just works. Plus, they’re quite simple to throw together, requiring just one bowl and about 30 minutes to prepare. This is a the kind of party favor I can get behind.

If you’re not a fan of the cookie sandwich, simply top each single cookie with a touch of the frosting. Or, if frosting makes you gag, simply opt out of it altogether (who ARE you?). The cookies themselves are pure perfection on their own.


","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). In a bowl, cream butter. Then add sugar and egg and mix again. Add molasses and mix until well combined.Add flour, salt, baking soda and spices to a sifter and gradually sift over wet ingredients while mixing. Beat until well combined, scraping sides as needed.Chill dough for 10-15 minutes while oven continues to preheat.Scoop rounded 1 Tablespoon balls of dough onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet – press down slightly with your finger to flatten. (Rolling in sugar is optional, but not necessary.)Bake for 9-11 minutes, being careful not to over bake. Cook completely on a cooling rack and then prepare buttercream by creaming butter and zest, then adding in powdered sugar in 1/2 cup measurements. Thin out to desired consistency with orange juice. Mix until well combined and fluffy, scraping down sides as needed.Once cookies are cooled, place a generous amount of buttercream on the bottom of half the cookies and top with the other half (you will have leftover frosting). Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. However, they’re best when served fresh."
863,Peanut Butter and Jelly Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Date Smoothie

Dairy-free, dairy-free, dairy-free – I can do this. If I say it enough times, will it work? I hope so – my digestive health depends on it.

Most of the smoothies I’ve made in the past have contained some form of whey protein powder or yogurt, making them a no-go for me while I’m on my dairy-free test run. This recipe was an experiment of sorts. One recent morning I fumbled around the kitchen in my jammers to see if I could get a creamy texture without any dairy and it was a total score. I think the jammies helped.

PB&amp;J has always been one of my favorite flavor combinations, ever since I was a kiddo eating a triangle cut sandwich with eyes locked on a TV playing Woody the Woodpecker. And this smoothie is a a refreshing presentation of that. Dates and bananas provide natural sweetness, blueberries plenty of of antioxidants, peanut butter protein and healthy fat, and flaxseed fiber and omega 3s. The almond milk adds virtually zero calories and a dreamy amount of creaminess. One sip in and I knew it was a win. I see this smoothie happening many more mornings in 2013. After all, if I can have a PB&amp;J twice in one day, why wouldn’t I? Psh, that’s what I thought.

",Add all ingredients to a blender and mix until well combined. Add more frozen blueberries or banana to make it thicker or more almond milk to thin it out.

My dad used to hate buying Lactaid milk for me as a kid. He only told me that recently, but I found it quite humorous, especially considering he never confronted me on the issue as a kindergartner.
Of our small family of four, I was the only lactose-intolerant schmuck while the rest of the group was fine with 2%, seemingly ruining the party for all dairy-loving members. “Ice cream, everyone? Well, almost everyone…?” My digestive tract simply hated me, and my special needs didn’t stop there.

I was also severely allergic to cats and everything outdoors. I required allergy shots, medications and endless doctors visits where I’d sit in the waiting room and get my hands locked in a Chinese finger trap, more than once. I couldn’t swallow pills so my mom had to budge for more expensive liquids – another event my dad detested. I had the worst teeth of anyone ever – each tooth proudly facing its own unique direction – which required retainers on top of braces on top of retainers just to make me an acceptable member of society again. I also cried every day in the 4th grade because I missed my mom and hated my new school in the middle of nowhere rural America, far from my familiar New Mexican surroundings.
Oh, and I had asthma, but let’s not even go down that road. There was a lot of wheezing, inhalers, breathing chambers, and treatments; rather a sad sight from anyone’s perspective.

Somewhere between braces, freshman basketball and community college I dropped the lactose intolerant bit, almost like how I stopped wearing glasses in 2009 to force my eyes to get better. My eyes obeyed, my stomach did not, and it’s been fighting with me on dairy quite angrily for a couple years now.
I was intolerant of my very own intolerance and, like moldy cheese in the back of your fridge,it came back to bite me. I should’ve been tending to this years ago, but I’m fixing that now; or at least trying. Better late than never, I suppose.

In 2013, I’m resolving to listen to my body more, feed it foods it agrees with and leave things like dairy by the wayside, at least temporarily. This recipe may not be the equivalent of a salad in terms of health, but it is dairy-free and healthier than your average pie. Those are two things my stomach can get behind at the moment.

Breakfast pizzas are typically savory but I prefer them sweet. This one consists of a simple pizza dough (store bought or homemade; I include a recipe below), baked apples, a raw-sugar streusel and dairy-free vanilla glaze.
John and I snacked on these one lazy afternoon this week and couldn’t help but liken them to the dessert pizzas you’ll find in any American pizza stand, only way better. They’re fresher, more wholesome and embarrassingly simple to make. These would make an excellent weekend treat, brunch item or late-afternoon or after-dinner dessert. I prefer them any time of the day, like most things covered in glaze and baked apples.

So here’s to a New Year. Here’s to resolutions both small and grand. Here’s to health and happiness in 2013. And here’s to another delicious and simple recipe that’s certainly worth sharing. At the risk of sounding cliche, cheers!


","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Arrange apples on the baking sheet and sprinkle with lemon juice, cinnamon, brown sugar, corn starch and toss. Then speckle tiny dots of Earth Balance over the top. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until soft and fragrant, tossing once halfway through. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.Raise oven temperature to 450 degrees F (232 C) and divide your pizza dough into three even portions (as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Roll out on a lightly floured surface until the crust is quite thin.Transfer pizzas to lightly greased baking sheets and top with apples. Prepare streusel by combining raw sugar and flour and then cutting in butter until well combined. Sprinkle over the top of the apples.Bake pizzas for 10-12 minutes or until the edges appear lightly brown and the toppings are bubbly.Meanwhile, prepare glaze by combining powdered sugar with vanilla and melted butter and whisking in almond milk until desired consistency is reached – thin enough to drizzle. You will have leftover glaze.Remove pizzas from oven and drizzle with vanilla glaze, cut however you please and serve warm. These store well in an airtight container refrigerated for up to 2 or 3 days. Simply reheat in the oven or microwave before serving."
865,Almond Joy Nut Butter (GF & V) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Joy Butter

Of all of the candy bars in candy bar land Almond Joys may be my least favorite, but hear me out. The flavor combination of chocolate, coconut and almond is simply delectable – it just doesn’t belong in a terribly processed sugar bomb (no offense, candy makers). No, it was meant for better things, so it was a no-brainier to turn it into a creamy, dreamy, buttery spread. The candy bar, though? I’ll definitely still pass.



Ever since I learned how to make almond butter at home it’s been one of the main staples in my diet. I probably make a batch every 2-3 weeks to keep my supply well stocked and while the traditional roasted, salted varieties are lovely, I was ready for some variety. Being that chocolate and coconut are two of my most favorite flavors, the two just collided with almonds in one beautiful sloppy, sweet, savory mess. Friends, I think I’m in love.


This recipe is so simple to throw together, requiring less than 30 minutes, 5 ingredients and 1 spoon (or spatula). Less mess, more time to do what you please – that’s my philosophy.
Beyond being easy to make, this spread is incredibly versatile. I lather it on my toast in the mornings, serve it alongside my carrots and apples, and even eat it right out of the jar. I can only imagine how sensational it would be atop pancakes or inside the little squares of a well-crafted waffle. *shudder* – I’m getting weak just thinking about it.

","Place almonds on a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 12-15 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes.In the meantime place coconut in a food processor and process until it turns into butter, scraping down sides as needed (10 minutes). Scoop into a dish and set aside.Place cooled almonds in the food processor and process until it turns into butter, scraping down the sides as needed (about 8-10 minutes). Then add in the coconut (reserving some if you prefer a less pronounced coconut flavor). Process to combine, add sea salt and vanilla and process once more.The mixture will be warm at this point so you can add in the chocolate to let it melt and fully combine, or you can wait until the spread cools to keep a chunkier chocolate texture.Stir chocolate to combine and then place in glass jar or Tupperware for storing. Store at room temperature so it does not solidify. However, if storing for more than 2 weeks, store in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before use."
866,Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Bites
Well hello! I thought I’d drop in and share a little treat to keep the New Year’s good health juju going. Let’s be honest, we can all use as much help as we can get and this recipe is one designed to please the masses (unless you’re my sister who hates bananas – how are we even related?). I love banana bread, you love banana bread, everyone loves chocolate, and we could all use another healthy snack in our rotation, right? See, things are working out in the New Year after all. Told you, naysayers.


These little gems are fluffier than banana cookies but denser than banana bread, putting them somewhere right in between on texture. However, the flavor of banana bread is ever-present and the chocolate chips help give them that extra special “treat” feel, like “I’m eating a cookie, this is so awesome.” See how awesome things just got? That escalated quickly.
Ever since her royal Ladycakes gifted me a bottle of her homemade vanilla extractwhen John and I visited her in December, I’ve been itching to use it. This is the first recipe I’ve tried it in and was super pleased (seriously you guys, check it out).The batter in itself is quite wholesome, featuring oats, whole wheat flour, flax seed, and maple syrup or agave as a natural sweetener. These little bites make an ideal vegan breakfast on-the-go or take-along snack. I, however, preferred the “shovel as many into my mouth as I can in one sitting” approach. You know, for sampling purposes and such.
Enjoy, I really, really hope you do.

","In a large bowl, mash the banana then add baking soda, baking powder, salt, flax seed, vanilla extract, almond butter, agave nectar, olive oil and stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.Add in the whole wheat pastry flour using the spoon and level method (as opposed to using the measuring cup as a scoop and then leveling), and rolled oats and stir. It should be wet and sticky, but if it appears runny, add another 1/4 cup or more of oats.Add most of the semisweet chocolate chips and stir until just combined. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes while preheating oven to 375 degrees (190 C).Scoop slightly rounded 1 Tbsp measurements of the batter and drop onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a non-stick silicon baking mat. Space about 1 inch apart, then slightly press down with back of spoon and sprinkle with additional chocolate chips and/or turbinado sugar.Bake for 10-11 minutes or until they appear set. You aren’t going for brown edges – you want them moist and just cooked. Let cool slightly on cooling rack and serve warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days."
867,Broiled Romaine Salad with Caesar Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Broiled Romaine Salad with Rosemary Caesar Dressing

One too many sugar cookies. Finished off the last third of that pie. Snuck 3 pieces of peanut butter fudge when no one was looking. We know. Us too. That’s why we made you a salad.Now come here and cry on mama’s shoulder.

Solution: fancy romaine salad with homemade Caesar dressing.
If you’ve never tried grilled romaine salad you’re missing out on a serious treat. I was the last person to expect it would be such a fantastically different flavor experience than fresh romaine, but it truly is. Something about the way the searing hot grill kisses the olive-oil brushed leaves just takes it to a whole new level of awesome. But you don’t need a grill for this recipe – we pop it under the broiler instead for a similarly stellar result.


Simply wash and dry the prettiest looking leaves in your bunch – the closer to the center the better – toss them lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper, and then pop them under the broiler for a few minutes, rotating once to ensure even cooking. Then, top with this super simple rosemary Caesar dressing and some fresh shaved Parmesan.

This salad is more special in taste and texture than a traditional romaine salad, making it perfect for entertaining. And the dressing adds a creamy, spicy punch. This dish could easily be considered an entree if you bulked it up with some grilled chicken, roasted veggies or toasted nuts. Plus, if you make it for all your friends they’ll be super impressed. Three points for the classy hostess.


","Position oven rack to the highest level and heat oven to low broil.Peel away the outer most leaves from the romaine head and save for other use. Pick out about 8-10 leaves, wash, dry and toss in olive oil, salt and pepper (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and set aside.Prepare dressing by adding mustard, vinegar, mayo, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper to a small bowl and whisking to combine. Slowly stream in olive oil (I usually go for the lesser end of the range) while continuing to whisk to emulsify the dressing. Whisk vigorously until well combined.Add fresh rosemary, whisk once more and sample to taste. Adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt, pepper or rosemary as desired.Place romaine under broiler and watch closely while it cooks for 1-2 minutes. Flip when the leaves start to brown a bit, then cook for 1-2 minutes more. It’s a fairly quick process – you’re essentially looking for them to wilt a bit and soften.Remove from oven, divide the romaine between serving plates and top each with 2 Tbsp dressing and several shavings of Parmesan cheese."

This time last year this blog didn’t exist. I was working at a coffee shop in a city I despised, John was only halfway through law school – which he hated – and ‘our life’ as we’d planned it just wasn’t where we’d hoped. The funny thing is, our circumstances were all a result of decisions we had made, whether actively or passively. And despite our careful planning and forethought, we simply weren’t happy with the direction we were headed.We all know what you’re supposed to do in these situations: Remain positive and keep putting one foot in front of the other even if the road ahead appears grim.
But on New Year’s Eve of 2011, we did just the opposite.

As we sat in our third-story one bedroom apartment with our blinds open, listening to the sound of rain tick the sides of our building and fireworks go off in the distance, we talked about our lives: what we wanted, what we didn’t want, what it would take to get there, what was holding us back, and if it was possible to achieve.
The conversation was one of the best we’d had yet, one that honestly changed the trajectory of our lives as a married couple and as individuals possibly forever. That night we decided if we don’t like something we change it, and if there’s something we want to do – be it as small as starting a website or as big as traveling the world – we find a way to do it.From the outside looking in, we look like crazy people sometimes. But if we’re doing what we love, does it really matter?
We’ve realized it’s extremely important to ask yourself – and ask often – what it is you really want to be doing with your day, your week, your life, otherwise you drift, begin reacting instead of enacting, and never really end up where you want to be. If you want something bad enough you can make it happen, you just have to remove the distractions and find a way. After all, if your happiness is at stake is there really any other option?
One year later we are leaps and bounds closer to where we want to be. John graduates from law school in May – thank God; I balance my time between writing, cooking and photography; and we have our eyes set on where we want to be in the next few years. Honestly, it feels amazing, liberating and totally worth raising a glass to. I can’t wait to see what 2013 brings. If we make half the progress we made in 2012, I can only expect it to be awesome.
So cheers to a New Year, and thanks in advance for celebrating with us in 2013. Here’s one seriously fine cocktail to kick things off.

","Mix vodka and sugar, in the serving glass, stirring well until the sugar is mostly dissolved. Alternatively, you could use a shaker for larger quantities.Add pomegranate juice and squeeze in your lime. Then add tonic water and stir.Drop in ice cubes and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds, garnish with a lime wedge and serve."
869,White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whole Wheat White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies with Sea Salt

My favorite cookie has always been white chocolate macadamia nut but this recipe takes the obsession to a whole new level. Plus, it’s made with wheat flour so they’re practically health food. You’re welcome, Santa.

These cookies are about as simple as they come: 30 minutes from start to finish and one bowl required, meaning minimal effort and clean up. That’s my kind of cookie.


I can’t help but suggest these are the perfect cookie to leave behind for Santa because they’re slightly heartier thanks to whole wheat pastry flour and are a nice break from the usual chocolate chip. Plus, the berries make them festive. I believe I’ve made my case.

Oh man these were so good, for breakfast even! (Sshhh, I won’t tell.) Buttery, slightly crisp, moist, white chocolate chips in every bite with an occasional bright, tart note from the cranberries. Friends, this is cookie simplicity at its finest.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and cream butter in a large bowl or Kitchenaid mixer. Add sugars and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down sides as needed.Add egg, vanilla, sea salt and beat again.Sift in whole wheat flour and baking soda and mix until well incorporated, scraping down sides again as needed.Add white chocolate and cranberries and stir until well combined. Then chill dough for 10 minutes while oven continues preheating.Shape cookies into rounded 1 Tbsp balls, press down slightly onto a parchment-lined or un-greased cookie sheet and sprinkle with sea salt (I recommend a healthy pinch).Bake for 10-12 minutes, remove and let set on sheet for 2-3 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. These are excellent served immediately or the next day and would also keep well in the freezer for several weeks."
870,Overnight Honey Wheat Cinnamon Rolls | Minimalist Baker,"Overnight Honey Wheat Cinnamon Rolls

Ever thought cinnamon rolls were the most labor intensive baked good ever? Yeah me too, until this recipe came along.

You know what else? These rolls are perfect for Christmas, which I intend to celebrate joyfully this year – twinkly lights, homemade ornaments and ooey gooey cinnamon rolls all in tow.

I wanted to share a Christmas morning recipe that took the stress off Christmas Day and shifted it to the night before – you know, when Santa and his elves are churning. Seems like an appropriate time to be cranking out Christmas goodies, eh?
These rolls are simpler than most because they’re prepped the night before and require one mixing bowl for the entire process. All that’s left to do in the morning is a quick rise, preheat, bake, glaze and voila: breakfast is served. Now all that’s left to do is open presents and lounge. Sheesh, life is rough.


I included two glazes because I believe options are not only a privilege but a right, says the girl who mixes three cereals and two milks in every bowl. I preferred the vanilla but I guess I’m somewhat of a cinnamon roll purist if there ever was such a thing. However, the bourbon caramel glaze is just as temping and you probably already have some on hand if you whipped up a batch when I shared the recipe two weeks back. If you didn’t, well, you should. It requires just 4 ingredients, 15 minutes and will probably change your life.


These babies were absolute perfection and more healthy than the average roll thanks to whole wheat pastry flour and limited butter. They are sturdy but moist, just sweet enough with the brown sugar-cinnamon filling, and perfectly frosted for that optimum bite with each fork full. Gee, I could’ve devoured three…or maybe I did.
In any case, I hope your holiday celebrations are grand! Merry (early) Christmas from our little nook to yours. Now let’s all get cozy with some honey wheat cinnamon rolls, shall we? I was hoping you’d say yes.



","Sprinkle the yeast over warm water and allow to bloom for a few minutes, then whisk until smooth, adding in 1/2 cup of the flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm spot for about 15 minutes.Add the eggs, honey, and salt and stir, then add remaining 3 1/2 cups flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to the mixture. Mix until well incorporated and then transfer to a lightly floured surfaced.As you knead add the 1/4 cup softened butter (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) to the dough and continue kneading, adding flour to reduce stickiness when needed until the dough is smooth - 7 to 10 minutes.Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled - about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish and transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Roll out into a large rectangle and brush with 1 1/2 Tbsp melted butter (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the butter and then starting at the long side covered with sugar, roll up the rectangle as tightly as you can and pinch the seam together as the dough allows.With the seam facing down, cut into 15-18 equal pieces (~2 inches), depending on how tall you want them. Place the rolls in the dish and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in the refrigerator overnight. Rinse your bowl for making the glaze in the morning.In the morning remove rolls from the refrigerator and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and bake until golden brown, about 20-30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 15 minutes.While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze: Melt butter in your mixing bowl and then whisk in the milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Whisk until a smooth paste forms adding more sugar as needed. Spread the glaze over the warm rolls and serve immediately. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for several days."
871,Chewy Double Chocolate Peppermint Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chewy Double Chocolate Peppermint Cookies

Sometime between December 1st and now I was hit by a severe craving for chocolate and peppermint, and friends this is rare as I expressed in my 5-Ingredient Peppermint Mocha Frappe post. I used to be a chocolate-mint hater but now we have a growing love affair. Thankfully this recipe satisfies my deepest chocolate peppermint cravings, perhaps just as much as a double scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Ughghghg, so good.


It is Christmas after all so that means it’s time for baking. I come from a long line of bakers, my mom, aunts and grandmothers included. My Grandma Sally makes a mean peanut brittle, my aunts are pie extraordinaires, and my mom taught me the art of making the perfect peanut butter blossom. All of these things ring Christmas to me so it’s natural for me to hover around the kitchen a bit more in December. It’s in my blood.


These cookies may look a little complicated but they’re actually very simple. Just 30 minutes from start to finish and prepared all in one bowl. I hate having to get out loads of ingredients and multiple bowls just as much as the next person so this cookie has been whittled down to the bare bone necessities.
However, it doesn’t lack that perfect cookie texture, or luscious chocolate peppermint flavor one bit. Ask my coworkers who literally downed the whole batch by 10 a.m. after I dropped them in the break room. I guess you could say they were a little popular. I think Santa would approve.


I ate my cookie as is but I bet they’d also be great frozen and dipped in milk like Thin Mints (oh my gosh those are so good). I also suspect they’d make the perfect partner to hot cocoa or crumbled into a vanilla or mint milkshake (that would be the end of me). The possibilities are endless.


Simple factor: 30 minutes from start to finish; prepared using 1 bowl
","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together for about 1-2 minutes. Add egg, peppermint extract and beat until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides as you go to ensure even mixing.Add flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking soda and powder to a sifter and sift gradually over the wet ingredients mixing as you go. Mix until well combined.Add chocolate chips and stir in with a mixing spoon and then chill in the freezer for 10 minutes while the oven finishes heating.Form the dough into small balls (heaping 1 Tbsp) and place 1.5 inches apart on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Press the tops down and then top with a few more chocolate chips (to indicate what's inside).Bake for 10-12 minutes - the edges should start to dry but the tops will still be slightly soft looking. Let set on the cookie sheet for a few minutes more but sprinkle crushed candy cane on immediately.Transfer to a cooling rack to rest until completely cooled. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for up to a few days or freeze for several weeks."
872,Whole Wheat Griddle Cakes with Fruit Compote | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whole Wheat Griddle Cakes with Blueberry Orange Compote

It doesn’t get much better than a warm stack of pancakes on a weekend morning. I’ve loved them ever since I was a wee Dana and they were the only thing my mom could coax me out of bed with in the morning before school. It may have been pitch black outside and my body was fighting with all its might to remain at rest, but if I knew there was a hot stack of pancakes waiting for me I would somehow muster the energy to get to the breakfast table – sometimes crawling. Well this is embarrassing, but when I was in grade school I was such a morning hater that my mom used to bundle me up in my blanket and carry me – yes carry me – to the kitchen where I’d sit slumped over on a breakfast bar stool. This proves three things: 1) my 5 foot 2 inch mother is saint, 2) I was an extremely spoiled child, and 3) pancakes have always been there for me.
 These pancakes are less like a traditional pan- “cake” and more of a griddle cake, which is defined as “a flat cake of thin batter fried on both sides on a griddle.” They’re similar to a pancake but the batter is thinner and they’re not as sweet – more hearty, if you will. Plenty of whole wheat flour, oats, a touch of butter and sugar, an egg, and some buttermilk. These are about as minimalist as they come, just the way I like it.


And the compote? Amazing. Warm blueberries with orange juice and zest and a touch of sugar. I considered adding an herb but it just didn’t seem right. When you have a good thing going don’t be tempted to throw in more “things” just for the sake of being exotic. Sometimes all you need are the basics (most of the time as far as I’m concerned).


How do they taste? These griddle cakes are all kinds of delicious – light in texture, slightly less fluffy than a pancake, not overly sweet and seriously satisfying. The blueberry orange compote is the perfect addition to make this a complete meal. Syrup is certainly optional, but if it’s the weekend, I say go for it.

","Preheat griddle to medium heat and place a small saucepan over medium heat. Add blueberries, sugar, orange juice and orange zest and bring to a simmer, mashing the berries with the back of a spoon. Once warm, bubbly and thickened, remove from heat and set aside.Whisk together dry ingredients in a large bowl. Mix wet ingredients separately and combine the two, stirring until just combined.Spoon scant 1/4 cup measurements onto the lightly greased griddle and cook until bubbles form on top and the edges appear slightly dry - the underneath should be golden brown (about 2 minutes).Flip and cook on the other side for 1-2 minutes more or until golden brown underneath.Serve warm with orange blueberry compote and maple syrup."
873,Creamy Brussels Sprouts and Shallot Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Brussels Sprout &amp; Shallot Dip

Oh dear, how do I explain myself? Well, I’ve always loved spinach and artichoke dip and upon my more recent discovery that I love Brussels sprouts I grew curious of what they’d be like in a dip. One shallot, two cloves of garlic, and healthy dose of cheese later and here we are: holiday appetizer dip at its finest. Everybody’s tired of the spinach and artichoke variety anyways, right?

This dip is absolutely dreamy. I sautéed minced garlic, shallot, and roughly chopped brussels sprouts for a few minutes, then mixed cream cheese, sour cream, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese together in a separate bowl. Next I blended the two together, baked it until it was all warm and bubbly and voila: Creamy Brussels Sprout and Shallot Dip. So easy and so delicious. Just 9 ingredients and one mixing bowl required. This dip would be perfect with crunchy veggies, toasted bread, crackers or pita chips, but I especially loved it with yellow corn tortilla chips. The salt-on-salt combo was to die for. Take our landlord’s word for it – I gave her a sample and she asked for the recipe after the first bite. And John even liked it and he’s not typically a fan of strange alien-looking green things. What can I say? This dip is legit. Serve it at your holiday parties, social gatherings or as a classy appetizer on a special night in. You simply won’t regret it.

","Heat a cast iron or oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once hot add 1 Tbsp olive oil, shallot and garlic (amount for oil as original recipe is written // use half of total if altering batch size). Stir constantly as to not to let it burn.Add Brussels sprouts, sea salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until tender and slightly wilted and then remove from heat, turning off burner as well.In a separate bowl mix together sour cream, cream cheese, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, another pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Add Brussels sprouts mixture to the bowl and stir until well combined.Use remaining olive oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written) to lightly grease the cast iron so the dip doesn’t stick. Spoon dip back into the skillet and bake at 375 degrees F (190 C) for 11-13 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Serve with veggies, pita, crackers, bread or tortilla chips. Tortilla chips were my favorite."
874,Peppermint Mocha Frappe with Coconut Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peppermint Mocha Frappe with Coconut Milk

I used to be an absolute mint-chocolate hater. Anything containing any semblance of that flavor combination sent me running, especially when it came to desserts. No, I wouldn’t like any peppermint patties, thank you very much. But then, something happened. I don’t know if it was the Andes mint that won me over, the multiple times I’d watched my boss’s husband slurp down a mint chocolate chip shake looking sublimely at peace, or the one time I was desperate for ice cream and the only flavor my aunt had on hand was mint chip and I maybe kind of slightly enjoyed it a little bit but didn’t want to admit it. Yes, something changed. Now mint, chocolate and I are like besties. Like Lianne La Havas, winged eyeliner and a Danelectro guitar. Ever since giving it a second chance this summer on a random trip to Braum’s, I now get one scoop of coffee chocolate chunk and one scoop of mint chocolate chip every time; and then off I go on my merry way.
 
This chilled coffee beverage is quite a delight and SO easy to make! Coconut milk ice cubes make a creamy simple base, strong brewed coffee adds a nice morning kick (ours is home roasted), creamy chocolate syrup and cocoa powder add the mocha punch, and natural peppermint extract gives the whole thing a delightful minty feel. Yep, I’m a total fan of this frappe: Cool, creamy, chocolatey, minty and plenty of caffeine. I don’t know what else I’d add! Oh yeah, whipped cream and fresh mint! Go wild. It is the holidays after all.
 
This would make a perfect breakfast companion, afternoon treat or evening dessert. You could even add a shot of Kahlua or Bailey’s to give it an extra kick. Any way you serve it you really can’t go wrong.


","The night before prepare your coffee and chill it in the fridge so it's cold in the morning. Also pour your coconut milk (or any milk) into an ice cube tray - you'll need at least 8-10 - cover with plastic wrap and freeze.In the morning add all ingredients to a blender and mix until well combined, adding an extra milk ice cube if needed. Taste and adjust flavors as needed.Serve immediately or chill/freeze for later. Whipped cream, chocolate syrup and fresh mint make lovely toppings."

There’s something about being rooted in community that just feels right, but you don’t realize how important that is until it’s no longer there.
Over the summer I began to reflect on this. John and I have lived in three cities in the nearly three years we’ve been married and have moved nearly twice that amount in the meantime. While that has allowed us to latch onto and let go of several new friends in our life, it’s left me with an almost eerie sense of not knowing who my community is at any given time and where I belong. When I start to feel a bit estranged in this world I begin to feel like my piece of the island has broken off from the big island and I’m floating off into the sea, all by myself, disconnected, adrift and hardly known by anyone but myself. And some days I’m not even so certain of that last part. But the good news is I can always make change where I see necessary. In most cases healthy, positive change is just one conversation or perspective shift away. The change I needed was to make new community where we’ve currently laid roots. I don’t know how long we’ll be here but for the time that we are here, I want to be present and intentional with the people around us. So John and I did the best thing we knew how to foster that community feel: We invited people over for dinner.


Close to 15 of our dearest friends from various settings including high school, work, church, and other random life events filled our humble little studio apartment one recent evening and it all felt so right; like a big hug from that favorite aunt you haven’t seen in years. I provided the essentials: Two batches of chili, cornbread (gluten free and non) and these gluten free cookies. Wine, laughter and plenty of dirty dishes soon followed.


At one point my friend and wedding photographer Rebecca leaned over and mentioned that the cookies reminded her of Girl Scout Caramel Delights or Samoas. They had all the essential elements but were just missing the caramel and chocolate coating to give them that finishing touch.
I didn’t think much of it then but when I recalled I had a batch of my bourbon caramel sauce tucked away in my fridge I knew gluten-free Samoas needed to be born. Since then I’ve made these several times each with positive results and resounding feedback. I gave my (gluten-free) friend Laura a small batch one night and she devoured them all in a matter of minutes before my eyes. I believe the adjective she kept using was “uuhhhmaaayyzzing.” Needless to say I think we found her (and my) new favorite cookie recipe.


These cookies may lack the abundance of flour, butter and sugar of traditional Samoas, but they in no way lack the flavor and definitive texture of the real thing. These are a must make not only for the holidays but for all your special gatherings in between. Gluten free decadence has never tasted so good.

Alternatively, melt over a double boiler.Remove cookies from fridge or freezer and using a spoon, coat the bottom of each cookie in a thin layer of chocolate. Place back on silicon mat or wax paper and then drizzle with bourbon caramel sauce and remaining melted chocolate.Refrigerate or freeze for another 5 minutes to set.

876,4-Ingredient Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Bourbon Caramel Sauce

Several months back I received an email from Joanna at Cup of Jo asking if I’d like to participate in her “Best __ Ever” series. This delicious series seeks to present the best recipe for classic dishes like hummus, chocolate ice cream and brownies. Given the choice of a dozen or so categories, my eyes were immediately drawn to the Best Sundae Ever pick, as ice cream is my all time favorite food. Ask John, he can vow that seldom three days pass before I’m aching for a double scoop. (Lucky for me, he always delivers.)

Though my deadline was weeks away I began brainstorming and dreamt up the perfect recipe: One scoop each of chocolate and vanilla ice cream from a local dairy in the Midwest, sliced bananas, chocolate syrup, homemade caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream and crushed salted peanuts. This combination, I thought, hit on salty and sweet and was altogether satisfying. I’m here to tell you my friends, it was.
Wanting to include an aspect that was unique, homemade and of course, simple, I decided on making caramel from scratch. If you’ve never made caramel from scratch it’s incredibly easy. This recipe (shared on Cup of Jo as well) requires just four ingredients and 15 minutes of your time and the result is a sinfully delicious and decadent bourbon caramel sauce that is perfect for topping sundaes, cookies, cakes, pies, crisps and everything in between. Find the recipe below and then check back on Saturday for another recipe using this tantalizingly simple recipe in another fantastic dessert setting. Trust us – you don’t want to miss it.

Watch closely as not to let it burn.Turn off burner and remove from heat and slowly add cream while stirring.Add pinch of salt and bourbon and place back on still-warm burner for another minute while stirring.Transfer to a heat-safe dish or bottle and let cool. Store covered in the refrigerator and bring to room temp or heat in a warm water bath before serving. You can also just simply microwave the jar for 30 seconds before each use without affecting the texture or flavor."
877,Noodle Bowl with Ginger Peanut Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Asian Noodle Bowl with Ginger Peanut Dressing

I kind of have a thing for noodle bowls, especially this one since it satisfies virtually all the requirements I look for in a meal: Quick, easy, flavorful, healthy and satisfying. Plus, this dish provides both heat from sriracha and fresh green onion and sweet from a creamy ginger peanut sauce. Friends, this is delicious simplicity at its finest.

The concept is simple: Prepare rice noodles, chop up fresh veggies of your choice (I prefer carrots and green onions), add in some protein (like tofu), fresh herbs (basil is my jam) and whisk up a quick dressing and throw it all together. It’s so incredibly filling and requires just 10-15 minutes of your time. It’s also vegan and gluten free, and for our peanut butter-adverse friends, simply sub in cashew butter or tahini. Finally, something we can ALL enjoy totally guilt free.

I typically make this style of dish for dinner, but add a sauce to the noodles and do a pad thai spin-off. But this fresh version is so light and refreshing and definitely hits the spot mid-day. However, it would make an excellent mid-week meal since it requires little time and thought and can be assembled buffet style so even picky eaters get what they want.

The peanut dressing is what makes this dish: Peanut butter, toasted sesame oil, honey, soy sauce, lime, ginger, chili garlic sauce and hot water. These ingredients can be found at any Asian market and for super cheap. At the market right up the way from our house I score giant bottles of Sriracha for like $2, packs of noodles for $1 and huge bags of basil for 69 cents. SIXTY NINE CENTS! Healthy and cheap? Sign me up.

","Prepare noodles according to package instructions – typically place in a bowl, pour boiling water over and let set for 10 minutes before draining.Prepare dressing by whisking together peanut butter, brown sugar, lime juice, ginger, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, and sesame oil. If too thick, add a splash of hot water and whisk once more. Set aside.Once noodles are cooked, drain and rinse with cold water. Place on towel to dry slightly.Add noodles, carrots, green onion, and tofu to serving bowl. Top with peanut dressing, fresh basil ,and sriracha and serve immediately."
878,S'mores Hot Cocoa+Charity Water E-Cookbook | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"S’mores Hot Chocolate + Charity Water E-Cookbook

Well hello there, sexy hot chocolate. Didn’t expect to see you there.

This hot chocolate is not only sexy it’s for a good cause. Minimalist Baker and five amazing food bloggers collaborated to create a downloadable e-cookbook to benefit Charity Water – one of our absolute favorite non-profits that works to provide clean, safe drinking water to people in developing nations. Here is just a glimpse at the amazing work they do. (Ugly girl sobs are welcomed.)

Minimalist Baker teamed up with Kelsey of Happyolks, Erin of Naturally Ella, Kate of Cookie and Kate, Ashley of Edible Perspective and Kristin of Iowa Girl Eats to bring you an amazing E-Cookbook that is completely FREE to download. All we ask in return is that you visit the Charity Water campaign page and consider making a donation. Charity Water puts 100% of funds raised directly toward the cause, which in this case will be to fund water projects in Ethiopia where 60% of the population does not have access to clean, drinking water.
Our goal is to raise $1,000, which may seem like a lofty goal, but we’re ambitious and plenty hopeful. Even $1 can make a huge difference in the lives of people in need so we hope you’ll consider making a contribution. (Not to mention, it would make a lovely holiday gift for family and friends.)


This luscious s’mores hot chocolate is just one of 9 recipes you’ll find inside the 1 Cup Water E-cookbook, which is now free for download. All of the recipes contain at least one cup of water, which serves as a reminder to us that the abundance of clean water we have access to truly is a luxury.

Download the cookbook for even more delicious recipes like this delicious s’mores hot chocolate, which is so easy to throw together. And it’s so delicious it’s practically dessert in a mug!
I LOVED how it turned out. The hot chocolate was perfectly creamy and sweet. The graham cracker crumbs met my lips with a sweet surprise at every sip. And the toasty marshmallows absolutely MADE it. If you prefer mix hot chocolates, simply skip the hot cocoa part and add your favorite mix to the mug. The graham cracker rim and toasty marshmallows are what really sets this recipe apart. Hope you love it as much as we did!

","Preheat oven to low broil and move oven rack to the second from the top (high enough up to broil your marshmallows). Place baking sheet on rack.Heat milk and water in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through - about 5 minutes. Be careful not to overheat or scald.Add cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, sugar, stevia and salt and whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined.Meanwhile, take a few marshmallows and rub them around the top of your mugs so the graham crackers will stick. Then, dip mug in graham cracker crumbs until well lined. You could also add some graham cracker crumbs to the bottom of your mug for extra graham flavor.Pour in hot chocolate and top with 1/4 cup marshmallows each. Carefully set mugs on the baking sheet in the oven and broil marshmallows until browned, watching carefully as to not let them burn.Carefully remove from the oven with a towel and serve with holders or a small towel to protect hand from heat (they should cool quickly for handling). Top with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and extra graham cracker crumbs for serving (optional)."
879,Crispy Baked Rosemary Garlic Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Rosemary Garlic Fries

This recipe comes with two stories: One, how we happened upon a bustling rosemary pant for just $2.50. And two, how we found a new restaurant in downtown Wichita that feels nothing like Kansas and everything like Portland, Oregon. Two terrific discoveries if you ask us.

First, the rosemary. I instagrammed a photo of our new herbs a couple weeks back and here’s a more flattering portrait of one of our new beauties. We’ve had basil for a while, which was a gift from friends that I use quite often in Thai and Italian dishes. But you can’t go wrong with more herbs. So when John and I were in our local Fresh Market a couple weeks back we saw an amazing deal: 2 herb plants for $5! I couldn’t believe it, and they looked so fresh. We instantly snagged a mint and rosemary and proceeded to the checkout to claim our prizes. The rest, as they say, is history.

The second part of this recipe is the inspiration behind it. We discovered this new restaurant in Wichita called Public that’s so rad we’ve literally been there three times already, purchased two Groupons for meals, and are going there tonight after we finish Christmas shopping.
Though I could say a lot about it, we love that they are committed to using fresh, local ingredients (a rarity in Kansas); serving creative and inspired dishes; and have daily $2 beer specials. Also, the owner used to live in Seattle, a city we’re quite fond of, and follows us on Twitter and totally RECOGNIZED us on our first visit. John and I have NEVER been recognized in public for Minimalist Baker, being that we’re such a young site (born just in June 2012). Needless to say we were flattered, impressed and are now hooked on this amazing new place.

On our first night there we invited a couple friends down and we split the rosemary garlic fries. I honestly wasn’t expecting anything amazing but one bite in and I was literally having a slow-motion intimate moment with that french fry. It was clearly hand cut, perfectly salted and studded with fresh pieces of minced garlic and rosemary. How very creative and delicious. So delicious, in fact, that once the fries were gone I was literally picking the rosemary out of the bottom of the bowl and putting it directly in my mouth. It was all over from there. I set off to recreate the recipe that very next day.

See how it all comes together? We discovered Public which led us to the rosemary which led us to this very recipe: a crispy baked french fry seasoned with fresh garlic and rosemary that’s casual enough to serve with a burger and sophisticated enough to serve to the snobbiest of foodies in your social circle. Trust us, we tried it and it was a winner on both accounts. Happy french-frying.

","Preheat oven to 475 degrees (246 C).Soak potatoes in hot water for 15 minutes, then drain and dry thoroughly with paper towels or clean dish towels.Dry the bowl they were in and then place them back in. Drizzle with olive oil and add salt and pepper and toss.Generously coat a rimmed baking sheet with oil and drain off any excess. Transfer fries to baking sheet and arrange in a single layer.Cover with foil and bake for 5 minutes. Then remove foil and bake for 15 minutes more. Remove from oven to turn over with a spatula. If they stick, just gently nudge them with the spatula and they will lift off the sheet. Make sure to keep them in a single layer to ensure even baking. Place back in oven to cook for another 5 minutes.Remove from oven, flipping once more. Return to oven for 5-10 minutes more or until golden brown and crispy.Remove from oven and transfer to a large bowl. Season with additional salt to taste and minced garlic and rosemary while still hot. Toss and serve warm."
880,Raw Mayan Vegan Truffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Mayan Truffles

Sometimes a girl’s just gotta have chocolate. But it can’t always be in the form of a double dipped cone from DQ (guilty), an entire dark chocolate bar (I’ve done that once or thrice) or a fat slice of chocolate cake (oh lordy, yes). Else, we might just become that fat slice of cake, and we don’t want that (we don’t right? OK, just checking…).

Friends, I have a solution. Rich chocolate truffles with plenty of decadent flavor and a hint of spice thanks to cayenne, nutmeg and cinnamon. Dates bring it all together and make it sweet. Sweet, spicy, chocolaty – I think we have all the bases covered, right?


These vegan truffles were inspired by the most adorable person on earth, Ashlae from Oh, Lady Cakes. I stumbled upon her blog a few months back and promptly sent her an email titled “friend request” that expressed how fabulous I thought she and her blog were, specifically her raw cacao ice cream. She replied just hours later saying “…thank you for not writing to tell me how terrible it is that I think it’s OK for people to consume 500-calorie bowls of ice cream. WHO FREAKING COUNTS CALORIES??!?!?!! The nerve of some people, I tell you what.”
We’ve been fast friends ever since.


These vegan truffles were certainly inspired by her lovely Lady Cakes (was that inappropriate?). She had me at raw. Then she threw in cacao and then slayed me with truffle. I simply added some coffee and spice. Try them both ways, they’re quite delicious either way, I tell you what.

","Place almonds in a food processor and process until nearly the consistency of almond meal - the pieces should be very fine but stop before it starts to turn to butter.Next add cacao powder, chocolate, dates (minus the water), and spices and blend well.Add 1 Tbsp of date water ONLY if your batter isn't coming together. It should be difficult to process at this point.Transfer to a bowl and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.Remove from freezer and roll into 1-inch balls. They will be sticky but manageable with the warmth of your hands.Roll in cacao powder (optional) and keep frozen to retain freshness. You can eat them chilled or at room temperature. I preferred them a tad on the warm side as you could taste more of the flavors."
881,Pumpkin Scones with Maple & Molasses Glaze | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Scones with Maple and Molasses Glaze

There are certain things about my personality that I will forever want to change but simply cannot. For instance, I will never shake my inability to become a night person no matter how late I rise. I will never be able to focus on what anyone else is saying unless it’s about food, coupons or something I said earlier. I hate that I cannot recall details for anything or remember once and for all that bangs are not for me. Greasy foreheads and fringe cuts don’t mix, seriously.
I don’t like that I turn up my nose at criticism, that I have no self control around cake and ice cream (no literally, none), and rush through things often overlooking the details. But the one thing that really bugs me about myself (did I really just say that?) is that I have to be reminded far too often of what I’m working toward in life, what I’m passionate about, and what I’m good at. It’s like if someone (usually my husband) doesn’t come along and hit my ‘reset’ button, I go straight into couch potato mode perceiving myself as incapable of doing anything right and consequently never leaving my pajamas and moping audibly most hours of the day.
Seriously, what is wrong with me?


OK, I know. This is awkward and I’m being too hard on myself. It’s like you’re sitting in on my own personal roast. But I’m getting somewhere, because one of the things that I do like about myself is my ability to look inward, see yucky stuff and want to purge it and make a change. Sure, that may be an ability that many people have, but when you actually do it it feels so good that you just have to share about it to remind yourself and maybe others of how healthy the act is. How healthy it is to say I don’t have it all right, I mess up a lot, and I am the epitome of imperfection. But, but-tutut, I can do some things right and others really well. I just have to remember that from time to time or else Mopey McPj Pants re-emerges and sucks the life and creativity right out of me. Egh, I hate that chick; so inconsiderate.

Mmmm, what does that have to do with scones? A lot really. Because these scones came to be the day after I had one of these mini realizations. They, in themselves, represent my cognitive ability to turn on the light bulb when things are getting dim. And, not to mention, they’re pretty dang tasty, too.


This all ties in (sort of) with a little quote I jotted down earlier this week while reading Augustine’s Confessions (yes, this is my idea of light reading). Even though it’s taken a bit out of context, it still applies here. That even if no one notices what you’re doing you should focus on finding joy in the things you love to do. For me, this week, it was making these scones no matter how feeble an accomplishment they may be. Because they were something – a delicious, delicious something – of which I am very proud of.


","Preheat oven to 400 degrees (204 C).Add flour, oats, almond meal, baking powder, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt to a food processor and process until well combined. Add butter and pulse until pea-sized.Transfer flour mixture to a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, pumpkin puree, eggs and vanilla extract.Add wet ingredients to the dry and mix until just combined. If it's still too sticky, add a bit more flour.Transfer to a floured surface, working with well-floured hands, and delicately pat into a 1-inch thick circle.Cut into 8 even sections and transfer to a parchment or silicone lined baking sheet. Bake for 22-24 minutes or until the bottoms are light golden brown and they look a little toasty on top.Remove from the oven and let cool on a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before applying the glaze - they should be only slightly warm to the touch.Once you've decided which glaze you prefer (I much preferred the maple, but I'm a maple lover at heart) stir the ingredients together in a small bowl until well mixed.Spoon over cooled scones and serve immediately.Store scones in an airtight container for up to three days, though they are best when fresh."
882,Creamy Pumpkin Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pumpkin Pie

I know, I know. It’s Thanksgiving Day and I’m kind of late to the pumpkin pie party. But this one was totally worth the wait: chilled with a crunchy graham cracker crust, cream cheese and pumpkin pudding layers, all topped off with whipped cream and toasted coconut. Need I say more? By the way, happy Turkey Day from Minimalist Baker!

This is a recipe that’s been passed down in my family, starting with my aunts to my mom and then to my sister and I. Now, consider it yours. It’s my absolute favorite pumpkin pie because it has a crunch from the graham cracker crust, a lightly sweetened cream cheese layer followed by a perfectly creamy pumpkin pudding layer, and it’s all topped off with a healthy dose of whipped cream. It literally does not get better than this.

I loved this dessert so much as a young girl that my Aunt Donna used to make me my own separate pie so I could have one all to myself at both Thanksgiving and Christmas! How ridiculous is that?
Thinking back, my aunt either did this because A) she wanted to fatten my string bean self up, B) she truly did love me like a daughter, OR C) I was causing dissension at Thanksgiving by claiming 3/4 of the pie before dinner even started. All three good reasons if you ask me. Either way, I scored an entire pie out of the deal.

The other awesome part about this pie because the fact that it’s insanely delicious? It’s so, so simple to put together. No baking required if you buy a pre-made graham cracker crust. Even if you already have a pumpkin pie recipe in mind this Thanksgiving, why not make a second? I hear pie goes fast around the dinner table, at least in my family (wink, wink).


","If making crust from scratch, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).In a large mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, half of the sugar (1/4 cup as original recipe is written), melted butter, and coconut oil and mix until moistened. Transfer to an 8- or 9-inch pie plate (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size) and press it on the bottom and sides as evenly as you can.Bake for 7 minutes and then set in the fridge on a towel to cool for at least 15 minutes.Wipe out mixing bowl and add the cream cheese, remaining half of sugar (1/4 cup as original recipe is written), and 1/4 cup milk (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Mix with a handheld mixer until smooth, then spoon into the bottom of the pie crust and carefully smooth the top. Set back in fridge.Rinse out mixing bowl and add pudding mix and milk. Beat on high for 2 minutes and then set in the fridge for 5 minutes.Remove pudding from fridge and add pumpkin puree and pie spice. Whisk until well combined and then add to the top of the cream cheese layer (all of it may not fit). Smooth top with a spatula or spoon.Cover and refrigerate for at least 4-6 hours. It will take several hours to firm up so leave overnight if you can. Top with whipped cream or whipped topping and toasted coconut (optional) before serving."
883,Coconut Chocolate Chip Almond Meal Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Meal Cookies with Chocolate Chips and Coconut

A month or so back I stumbled upon blog so lovely I immediately became enamored. The name, Sprouted Kitchen. The mission, to make whole foods tasty. The pair behind the movement, husband and wife Sara and Hugh Forte – cook and photographer, respectively.
Consider me hooked, hence the reason I hopped over to Amazon mere moments after discovering their site and snatched up a copy of their new cookbook. This is my humble attempt at honoring the amazing work Sarah and Hugh have put forth in this stunning book that has now become my constant cooking companion, favorite coffee table book, and source of light reading on the weekends (all three true statements).

I love Sprouted Kitchen because it’s not trying to be anything, per say, besides honest. It’s not trying to secure the market on gluten free cakes or sneak spinach into brownies or make you give up meat. It’s simply presenting whole foods in a beautiful, simple way and making them damn delicious in the process. Proof? These gluten-free cookies that require just a few ingredients (that’s my kind of recipe) and contain three of my favorite flavors: chocolate, coconut and almond.


John and I had a few friends over for dinner last week and as we were expecting a few gluten-free eaters, I knew these cookies would be just the thing to bake. I had everything on hand except coconut flake, which I walked a block or so over to our local specialty foods purveyor (Nifty Nut House) to grab a pound or so of. While there I also managed to snag a “sample” of a double dipped dark chocolate malt ball – an object so large it hardly warrants the title of sample and more like small feast. Either way, I headed back to our place, the Kansas wind whipping my hair in all directions, coconut clutched in my hand and a happy chocolate-coated malt ball belly in tow. Life was good.


I was so excited to make these cookies – my first recipe to try from Sprouted Kitchen – that I think I literally squealed out loud while gathering my ingredients. Three things I loved about this recipe: It was simple, healthy and quick to prepare; not to mention it yielded some seriously amazing chocolate chip cookies that any eater – gluten-free or not – would be pleased to pick up (yes, the cookie platter was plumb empty halfway through our dinner party).
So thank you Sara for dreaming up such delicious, wholesome recipes and sharing them on Sprouted Kitchen. And thank you Hugh for capturing it all with your impeccable photography skills. I suspect these cookies – and your cookbook – will be warming my little home and my heart for a long time to come. Cheers.

884,Vegan Gluten-Free Apple Crisp Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Vegan Apple Crisp

I know it’s basically the holiday season at this point and all but I still have to tell you this fabulous story about why I absolutely HAD to make this gluten-free vegan apple crisp on Halloween. We have some pretty amazing friends in our life right now and John and I LOVE getting together with them often to chat and laugh and eat delicious food. Well, two out of the six of our group are gluten-free eaters and another two of us are borderline vegan eaters (guilty as charged), but you just can’t go without apple crisp in the fall. You just can’t. Am I right? So I buckled down and did some research (and snagged some gluten-free flour from my friend Rebecca’s pantry) and came up with a delicious way to satisfy everyone’s appetites and dietary needs with one warm, sweet apple crispy dish.
Ta-da!


This apple crisp is about as simple and basic as they come, and though it’s vegan and gluten-free it’s just as delicious as any traditional version I’ve tried. Armed with non-dairy butter (Earth Balance, how I love thee), it’s totally dairy-free. And thanks to almond meal, gluten-free oats, and a gluten-free flour blend, it’s also void of the glutens. Good riddance, food allergies. Good riddance.

Wondering what it tastes like? Warm, sweet apples, plenty of warm spice from the cinnamon, and the crispy, crumbly oat topping is just the bee’s knees. Top it with some non-dairy ice cream (or dairy, if that’s your thang) and dig in. Fall has never been so darn delicious (or healthy), I’m convinced.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and lightly grease a 9x9 baking dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).Add apples to a large bowl or plastic bag and sprinkle with lemon juice. Toss to coat with granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt.Transfer to baking dish and set aside.Rinse and dry bowl and add brown sugar, flour, almond meal, oats, cinnamon, and salt and stir. Add melted butter and mix until it resembles wet sand.Sprinkle topping over the apples and bake until apples are soft and topping is golden brown (between 45 minutes to 1 hour).Let rest 10-15 minutes before serving. Is great with vanilla ice cream - caramel sauce is also a lovely addition."
885,Sweet Potato Parmesan Gratin | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Parmesan Gratin

I write this post on a full belly, the best kind of belly if you ask me. I dined on leftover pancakes and a chocolate breakfast shake and it’s approximately 11:45 a.m. The fact is, when you work at home some days you don’t wake up until 8:30 and you don’t shower until 10, which means you don’t have coffee ’til 11 and simply are not hungry for breakfast until noon. But if you ask me, what’s the big deal? My belly got fed either way…


Speaking of full bellies, this sweet potato gratin gave me a full belly. Sliced sweet potatoes with one wee little yellow potato in the mix, sprinkled with a touch of thyme, lots of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and baked to perfection – this is the breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack of champions.


I love how simple this dish is to throw together. It’s rustic in nature: loosely sliced sweet potatoes, a touch of salt, pepper and thyme, fresh grated cheese and a splash of milk. Throw her in the oven for an hour or so and you have a stunning and tasty dish on your hands. I personally prefer mine as an addition to lunch, but it also would be perfect alongside eggs or fruit for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.
The best part? It’s good hot, warm and room temperature meaning it’s a no-fuss kind of meal. If you haven’t guessed by now, that’s my kind of meal.


","Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Butter or lightly oil a baking dish or cast iron skillet.Place the sliced potatoes in a bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the thyme and half of the cheese and toss together.Transfer to the dish and pour on the milk. It should just cover the potatoes.Bake 30 minutes, remove from oven and carefully drain off a bit of the liquid (about 1/3 cup as original recipe is written). Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and return to the oven.Bake another 45-50 minutes, until the milk is absorbed, the potatoes are soft and the top and edges are golden. (Optional: drain off a bit more of the liquid as using low-fat milk instead cream can result in a bit of wateriness.)Let rest at least 20 minutes before serving so the juices can redistribute.Can be made ahead of time and reheated in the microwave or oven for serving."

Late one night last week, while John was getting ready for bed, I was scouring Pinterest on my iPhone. Some days, I barely pin anything at all on Pinterest, and others, I’m an absolute maniac, re-pinning everything I see. Cute puppies, strange tattoos, 18-layer cakes – you name it. This particular night, I found something that really caught my eye, so much so that I was determined to make it the very next morning.
The recipe I’m sharing is inspired by the one I found, which was featured on Babble. Kathy’s version was raw and mine’s not, so if you’re on a raw diet, by all means, stick with her version. But for those of you not on a raw diet, this is probably about the creamiest, dreamiest chocolate shake you’ll have that just happens to be vegan and totally healthy enough to call breakfast.

Since making this for the first time a week or so back, it’s been my go-to breakfast nearly every morning – so freaking delicious. You can taste the bananas only slightly, so if they’re not your thing, try it anyway.

You can easily add more cocoa powder to make the chocolate flavor even more prominent. Also, if you can’t have or absolutely despise bananas, you could probably just sub all frozen strawberries or blueberries for a similar result. I also highly recommend sneaking in some flaxseed and spinach for added nutrition without any affect on the flavor. Bottoms up!

","Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.If you prefer a more chocolatey shake, add more cocoa powder. If you prefer it sweeter, add more stevia or agave. If you prefer it thinner, add less ice OR more almond milk."

Having friends over this weekend? Hosting an all-girls affair? Just staying in and playing cozy all by your lonesome self? All three are excellent options if you ask me. But in any case I have just the thing: Vegan Mexican Hot Chocolate with sweet cinnamon, earthy nutmeg, spicy nutmeg cayenne and a dollop of creamy coconut whipped cream.
Oh yeah, #youknowyouwantthis.


As you know from my Boozy Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate story, I love hot chocolate. Its hot, sweet and chocolate-y goodness never does me wrong. But since I’m a part-time vegan and lover of all things coconut and spice, I decided to give an alternative recipe a try.


The base of this beverage is simple: Non-dairy milk (I mixed full-fat coconut milk and vanilla almond milk), cocoa powder, vanilla extract, salt, sugar, and pinches of Vietnamese cinnamon, nutmeg, and extra-hot cayenne. Then for a luxurious finish I add a layer of vanilla-infused coconut “whipped cream” made with my remaining coconut milk and drizzle it on top with a little chocolate syrup for good measure.
If my hot cocoa-loving neighbors wouldn’t have been nearby for sampling, I would’ve guzzled the whole batch down by myself.


","In a small saucepan, bring milk to a low simmer over medium heat.Add cocoa powder, sugar, salt, vanilla and spices and whisk vigorously to combine.Serve warm with coconut (or regular) whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.Place your coconut milk in the fridge overnight or in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. Upon removal, be careful NOT to shake the can as you want the cream to remain separated from the liquid.Open the can and scoop the top layer of cream into a chilled mixing bowl. Whip on medium-high until soft peaks form. (Add a dash of the remaining coconut liquid if it's too thick.)Add powdered sugar and vanilla and whip again to combine. Taste and adjust flavor/sweetness accordingly. Serve with hot cocoa and reserve the rest in an airtight container in the fridge for later use. Should keep for several days."

As I write this post I’m sitting in bed nibbling on the last of these cookies. I don’t know whether to savor these few remaining bites and relish in how truly delicious they are or weep over their soon-to-be absence. Yes, these cookies are that good; and they’re healthy.

I’ve made banana-based cookies before and this recipe is based off of that concept. Only this time I added a healthy scoop of pumpkin puree to the batter, as I always seem to have an excess of it lying around in the fall.
I also made them vegan and nearly gluten free thanks to the help of almond meal in place of most the flour (the whole 2 dozen batch has just 1/2 cup whole wheat flour). They also feature pecans and dried cranberries in addition to dark chocolate chips for extra substance. For this reason, I can easily call them breakfast with a clear conscious. But really, they’re so delicious I can eat them morning noon and night (and I do).

These cookies are irresistibly delicious, and unlike other desserts don’t leave you feeling miserable and heavy afterwards. They are insanely moist and slightly dense, pack a healthy serving of protein thanks to both almond butter and almond meal as well as pecans, and are just sweet enough with the addition of agave nectar and dark chocolate chips. You simply can’t have just one – you have to have two or three. Trust me, I tried. Didn’t work out.

Bake these, snack on these, share these, save these all for yourself. But simply don’t pass up making them – they’re too good to miss out on.

","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).In a large bowl mash the bananas then add almond butter, pumpkin puree, baking powder, baking soda, oil, agave nectar, salt, vanilla and stir.Add oats, almond meal and flour and mix well.Add chocolate chips, cranberries, pecans (optional) and stir until well combined.Drop cookies by spoonfuls on a baking sheet and press down slightly to flatten. Make them as uniform in size as possible (generously rounded tablespoons).Bake for 15-17 minutes or until the cookies are slightly golden brown.Rest on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Store in an air-tight container to keep fresh for up to 5 days."
889,Baked Sweet Potato Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Sweet Potato Chips

A few weeks ago we had our neighbors up for dinner and they brought the most fabulous sweet potato chips; baked sweet potato chips, I might add. I’d never tasted sweet potato chips so crispy, light and flavorful! Two bites in and I knew I needed the recipe. Thanks Laura, you’re a lifesaver. John finally likes sweet potatoes in some form. This is some kind of pre-Christmas miracle.

Out of curiosity since I don’t have a mandolin, I made these sweet potato chips two ways: I sliced half the batch thinly with a knife (left) and the other half with a vegetable peeler (right). The results were equally delicious, but I must say the knife method yielded a more satisfying bite so I’d recommend this over the peeler.

These chips are awesome! So crispy and flavorful, and all they require is a little olive oil and a pinch of salt before going into the oven to bake for a couple hours. That’s the trick – keeping your oven at 250 degrees and flipping once during the baking process to make sure they crisp up on both sides. The result is amazing.
These are a great stand-alone side dish but you could also top them with black beans, salsa and cheese for some crazy delicious nachos. Or you could add them to a sandwich for some serious crunch. Dream big people, the possibilities are endless.

","Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (121 C) and position oven rack in the center of the oven.Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible. If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not ""chip"" crispiness.Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt. Lay out in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for about 2 hours, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. I also rotated mine for more even cooking (optional but recommended).Remove once crisp and golden brown. Some may feel a little tender in the middle but take them out and let them rest for 10 minutes or so to crisp up before sampling. Serve immediately."
890,Vegan Gingerbread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gingerbread Waffles

Ho, ho, ho. Happy, November? Wow, how did that happen? 2012 is practically gone. Time to get (holiday) baking.
One of the quintessential flavors of the holidays is gingerbread. I’ve made ginger cookies and a small army of gingerbread men before, but never waffles. However, this recipe has been brewing in my mind for a while now and I was so pleased that it only took one try to get it right! I honestly half expected to see a crumbly mess upon opening up the waffle iron since the batter is vegan. But alas, it wasn’t so! Experimentation success.

This batter really is very simple to throw together. You likely already have all the essentials in your pantry right now: Pumpkin puree, molasses, whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar, ground ginger and cinnamon. Basic stuff, plus a little flaxseed and non-dairy milk to help keep this dish vegan. Buckle up kids – we’re quickly entering into vegan holiday foodie heaven.

Have I ever told you that John does all of the pouring for the photos? The pictures really wouldn’t be the same without him. I mean, how awkward would it look if my outstretched forearm was lurking in on the side of all the images, struggling to get that perfect pour down? Awkward, trust me. I’ve tried it and it doesn’t work out. So much praise to the photo assistant, who, in this instance, happens to be my adoring, charming and incredibly well groomed husband.

These waffles turned out as delectable as they look. Tender, spicy, not too sweet and hearty enough to be a stand alone breakfast. Plus, during the cooking process I found a way to help the waffles remain crispy once out of the iron. Simply lay them on a cooling rack so air circulates around them.
I’ve noticed that when I stack my waffles on a plate they get steamy and make each other a bit soggy. But when you lay them on the cooling rack for just a minute or two before digging in, it’s perfect! You could also make them even crispier by warming them in the toaster for a bit after cooling.

","Preheat waffle iron. Prepare flax egg by combining water and flaxseed in a large bowl and letting rest for 5 minutes.Add molasses, pumpkin puree, oil, brown sugar and whisk. Add almond milk and stir once more.Add flour, baking powder and spices to a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. Ideally, let batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking.Once preheated, generously spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and spoon about 1/2 cup of the batter onto the center of the iron and cook according to your machine's instructions. I like to set mine to the darkest setting so it gets extra crispy.Once done, remove and place on cooling rack to let steam roll of and crisp up a bit. Serve warm with vegan butter (such as Earth Balance) and maple syrup, or whatever toppings you desire."
891,Vegan Beer Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Beer Chili

I don’t know if you’ve ever cooked with beer, but if you haven’t you probably should. I am not a beer drinker myself in the slightest – an occasional hard cider at best – but I love what beer does to dishes. Somehow, it brings a new depth of rustic flavor to recipes that I absolutely adore. Though it was the last thing I expected, I am very much in love with this chili.


Of course, you can add meat to this dish if you’d like. I’ve tried it both ways and like them about the same. To do so, simply add a half pound of ground beef or turkey in place of the black (or kidney) beans for an equally delectable result.


When I make this chili I love having it for two meals in one week for the sake of convenience and cost. One night, we’ll have it as is with a side of cornbread, and another we’ll have it atop baked sweet or regular potatoes. I can’t decide which way I like it better – I’ll have to get back to you on that.


","Heat the oil in a large saucepan or pot over medium-high heat.Add the onion, garlic, green pepper and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Cook, stirring often, until softened - about 6 to 8 minutes.Add the chili powder and hot sauce, stir and cook for another minute.Add the beer and cook until reduced by half - about 6 to 8 minutes.Add the tomatoes (with their juices), beans (slightly drained), and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Bring to a simmer while breaking up the tomatoes slightly with a spoon. Cook until thickened - about 25 to 30 minutes.Serve with hot sauce, crackers and cornbread, or whatever toppings you prefer. If you're not vegan, cheese is a nice addition."
892,Nut and Honey Coconut Granola Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Nut-and-Honey Coconut Granola

A few years ago I was home sick from work with the flu. In my misery, I experienced a brief moment of hope where I emerged from a mountain of covers and kleenex to attempt to boost my spirits in the kitchen. I knew the one thing that would make me feel better was granola. I’ve always loved its heartiness and vibrant, sweet scent when it’s baking. I love that it has 16 times more protein than box cereal so you can enjoy a bit less and feel satisfied a bit more. And I love that it lends itself perfectly to yogurt parfaits.
So I mustered the energy to scuttle downstairs to our 1950s-style kitchen on the sunny, chilly winter day that it was and baked up a batch. This is a variation of that original recipe, which I still make today. Bundled in my blankets fashioned as an oversized dress and my furry slippers that many concerned friends have since convinced me to throw away, I stood there in the kitchen with sunlight streaming through the windows and sweet granola scent filling the air. Still groggy from my meds, I managed to have the thought, “Wouldn’t it be nice if I could just stay home and bake granola for people all day?” While that dream hasn’t been completely fulfilled, I am getting closer with my role on Minimalist Baker. So thanks for tagging along and following what we do. You guys are pretty stinking awesome.

I love that I get to play with ingredients in recipes like this one. It’s like I get to be a mad scientist in a sense, but with a pyrex and spatula instead of flask and tongs. To this batch I added pecans, cocoa powder and subbed coconut oil for canola. I was super pleased with the result as it came out smelling like coconut heaven, was just sweet enough, and basically consisted of half nuts half oats – yum.

By the time you read this post this granola is likely gone (#momentofsilence). But it was excellent while it lasted, and you can trust that I’ll be back in the kitchen dreaming up another batch soon – sick day or not.

","Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).Mix the oats, coconut, cinnamon, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and nuts together in a large bowl.In a small saucepan over medium low heat, warm the coconut oil, honey and vanilla extract and pour over the dry ingredients and mix well.Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet (may take two batches- or more if increasing batch size) and bake for 20-25 minutes, stirring a bit near the halfway point. The coconut oil will help this granola crisp up nicely but be sure to watch it carefully as it browns quickly.Add the craisins to the baking sheet in the last few minutes of cooking, so they don't get hard.Once the granola is visibly browned (about 23 minutes for me), remove from the oven and scoop into a bowl to let it cool. Place in a container that has an air-tight seal and it should keep for a few weeks."
893,Boozy Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Boozy Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate (2 Ways)

The first time I walked into a Starbucks I ordered a hot chocolate. I was confused. I hated coffee. Then I spilled it on myself. True story.


Since then hot chocolate and I have made amends. The stain came out. I once again remembered the luscious hot chocolate of my youth, even if it did consist of Ovaltine and freeze-dried marshmallows. It warms me when I’m bitterly cold in the wintertime. You could say we’re hot for each other again. Also a true story.

Sure, classic hot chocolate is good and well. But this hot chocolate is WHITE hot (get it?) and filled with pumpkin puree and plenty of pumpkin pie spice. And booze! Did I mention the booze?! It has booze.


The best part about this drink besides the fact that it’s perfect for cold-weather gatherings, grown up enough for even the manliest of manly men, and quintessentially fall, is that it warrants being topped with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Ooohhh yeahh.

If you love the buttery sweet flavor of white chocolate, the spicy heartiness of pumpkin, and the luscious decadence that is whipped cream and caramel (and booze – two kinds, pick your poison), then this is thee fall drink for you.
Happy fall, friends. Happy fall, indeed.

","In a saucepan over low-medium heat, melt the chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of the milk (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), whisking often (about 3 minutes).Once melted, add the rest of the milk, the pumpkin and the pumpkin pie spice and stir vigorously to incorporate.Pour a small amount of the hot chocolate into serving glasses (two as original recipe is written), add Kahlua OR bourbon (bourbon is much stronger in taste). Top off with hot chocolate, stir and then top with whipped cream, caramel sauce and more pumpkin pie spice (optional)."
894,Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries and Almonds | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries and Toasted Almonds

Yes, it is only the fourth week in October and I’m already slightly tiring of pumpkin. What am I going to do come Thanksgiving when my aunt makes me an entire pumpkin cream pie? I better start pacing myself.

In reality I love pumpkin, just not always in traditional settings like muffins, lattes and pies. I like to venture out and enjoy it instead in its most pure forms, like stirred into an old fashioned oats with just a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon. The flavor speaks subtly of fall, just the way I prefer it.

Recently I’ve been making creamy pumpkin oats with almond milk (a tip I was reminded of by Aubrey) and nestling them over a layer of blueberries. On top, I simply can’t get enough of crushed, toasted almonds. The creamy-crunchy contrast in texture it provides is nothing short of soul warming.

I’ve made this dish about a half-dozen times now and I think it gets better with each attempt. Try this for breakfast, won’t you? It’s a vegan-friendly breakfast packed with vitamins and nutrients and plenty of fall flavor. Is there really a better way to get your day started off right than that? I strongly doubt it.

","Bring the almond milk and water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add oats and salt and reduce heat to medium.Stirring occasionally, cook for 2 minutes and then add pumpkin. Cook for 3-4 minutes more or until creamy, being careful to stir often.In the meantime, toast almonds (or another nut) in a skillet over medium-high heat until dark brown on all sides.When ready, remove oats from heat and add flaxseed, cinnamon, brown sugar and stir.Microwave blueberries in your serving dish until thawed (if frozen) and warm. Top with oats and almonds and enjoy."
895,Vegan Banana Nut Muffins for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Banana Nut Muffins for 2

I’ve decided there are a lot of things that have to go right in my day to make it a good one. Quality coffee, good hair, new wears, exceptional weather, and of course, delicious food. If any one of these factors are amiss, there’s a fair chance the day’s events will follow suit. However, one particular trip to Kansas City with John proved to be quite the opposite. It was, for a lack of a better adjective, awesome.

It started with a good 30 minutes of playtime with the nephew at my sister and brother-in-law’s place in KC. There were lots of plastic bats and softballs flying, and fits of toddler squeals every few seconds. It was sheer joy. Then, off to the ladies room I went and a few shots of dry shampoo and a swipe of makeup later, John and I were out the door. Our first stop was the Plaza where we had one thing on our minds: coffee.

After walking into Latte Land and having a quick scan of the menu, my eyes were immediately drawn to the most beautiful banana muffin I’d ever seen, studded with giant whole, shelled walnuts. My mind was made up: A medium house coffee and that giant banana muffin.

A few minutes went by after receiving my coffee and I realized they’d forgotten my muffin. Extremely apologetic, the barista snagged my prize from the pastry case and offered me some free milk as a remedy for his fault. I obliged. The setting was perfect: Coffee, a banana muffin the size of my fist, and free local milk and wifi – I was in sheer heaven.

One bite into that muffin and I already wanted another one. Instead, I settled for recreating the recipe at home. Just a few days later upon our return back to Wichita, that’s exactly what I did. And literally, this is one of the best muffins I’ve ever had.

Three things I love about this recipe are 1) it’s hearty and healthy, 2) takes less than an hour to prepare, and 3) yields two GIANT vegan muffins that are seriously worthy of being sold at that very coffee shop. I wonder if they have an opening for a part-time baker? If so, that would be awesome, because I’m convinced the world needs more of these muffins.

These muffins are insanely moist and perfectly sweet, and they scream with rich banana flavor. And those giant nuts up top? Everything I’d hoped for and more. Plus, thanks to wholesome ingredients like flaxseed, whole-wheat pastry flour, and whole, shelled almonds, they’re actually quite healthy. At about 370 calories a piece, one of these constitutes a full breakfast meal. Since that’s about what I eat in the morning anyway, I’d be happy to keep these as a special weekend treat or cycle them the into my weekday breakfast routine. Oh joy.

","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and lightly butter two small ramekins with non-dairy butter (adjust number of ramekins if altering batch size). Prepare flax egg and set aside.In a large bowl, mash the banana, leaving some texture.Add brown sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk for one minute.Stir in flax egg, vanilla, melted butter and stir.Add flour and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined.Divide batter evenly into the ramekins - about 1/2 to 3/4 full - and generously top with walnuts.Bake for 25-30 minutes or until tops are golden brown and a toothpick or knife comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes, remove from ramekins and serve warm. Additional butter isn’t necessary - these are very moist and quite perfect as is."
896,Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Cookies & Glaze | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Cookies

Cinnamon rolls and I kinda have a thing. You see, we’ve practically been lovers since the 3rd grade when I discovered they were the one thing the lunch ladies at my school made from scratch that actually tasted like food.
Chili and cinnamon roll days were a special occasion and only came around once every few weeks in the winter months. This meant every fourth Friday people went into an all-out flurry rushing to the cafeteria to claim their sticky prize. Little did they know I’d sidled them and was always first in line, wide-eyed gripping my tray with a silly grin on my face, waving my finger at the biggest cinnamon roll in the bunch chirping “Ooh ooh, mine mine,” at the lunch ladies. They surely hated my 10-year-old self, tragically crooked teeth and all.
What ensued next was practically material for “50 Shades of Grey.” As I sat perched on the brown plastic benches in our cafeteria I stole delicate bites of my cinnamon roll between sinfully large spoonfuls of chili and anticipated that last ooey-gooey center bite – a climax and tragic ending all in one. Once the experience drew to a close it was cold lunch city provided by mom until the next chili and cinnamon roll day came around.



I’ve tried to make cinnamon rolls from scratch before, but without my mom by my side gently instructing me at every tur they always turn out like hockey pucks – nowhere near worthy of being enveloped in creamy frosting and consumed while cuddled up in a cozy chair with a hot cup of tea. Not even close.

So my solution in the meantime? Cinnamon roll cookies. PUMPKIN cinnamon roll cookies. You know, because it’s fall and whatnot.


This caramel glaze is my mom’s super secret recipe that she would share with anyone who asks. I called her the night before I baked my cookies to copy down the instructions and once more when I was in the process of making it. I wanted to make sure it was just right; can’t bring cinnamon roll disgrace to the family name, after all.

Hmm, based on the texture, caramel flavor and how it practically slid off my whisk onto my cookies, I’d say I nailed it.


Wondering what they taste like? Imagine a delicate sugar cookie with a gooey pumpkin butter-brown sugar center and a melt-in-your mouth caramel glaze. One cookie in and you’ll already be dreaming about your next two.
These aren’t your delicate tea time, laugh with your mouth closed and legs crossed type of cookie. They’re more of a full fat chocolate milk from the can “eat like a trucker while grunting ‘yeeeee haw'” type of cookie. Get the picture? Yeah…good.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Cream sugars and butter with mixer; add egg and beat until combined.Add dry ingredients to a sifter. Alternate adding milk and dry ingredients to the butter mixture while mixing. Then add vanilla and stir.Chill for 30 minutes before rolling out. Roll out into a rectangle on floured surface, spread with butter, pumpkin butter and top with brown sugar, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.Carefully and tightly roll into a log, then use floss or a serrated knife to cut into equally thin slices.Transfer to a baking sheet (they won't spread much) and bake for 14-15 minutes, being careful not to over-bake. They will be a little tender looking, but take them out, let them rest for 3-4 minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer them to a cooling rack.Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat.Add brown sugar and stir. Simmer the mixture while stirring frequently for 2-3 minutes.Remove from heat and add powdered sugar and milk and stir. If you desire a thicker or thinner frosting, compensate with more milk or powdered sugar.Spread or pour the glaze over the cookies (I used a spoon), sprinkle with more cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice (optional) and enjoy!Store in an air-tight container at room temperature to keep fresh for at least 3 days."

Fun, fun, party party, aka – we’re makin’ dough balls.


Last fall I made chocolate chip cookie dough bites and they were so delicious that I ate one every night after dinner for a month straight. Let’s just say that wasn’t the month of the skinny jean. Yikes.


This year? I’ve made PUMPKIN chocolate chip cookie dough POPS for fall – double upgrade, double fun. I’ve also wised up since last year and plan to magically transform into the dough pop fairy and share these with all my friends. Doing so will surely secure my spot in the skinny jean kingdom. Hello sexy November.


The concept for these pops is simple: eggless cookie dough with lots of pumpkin butter and pumpkin pie spice rolled into little balls on the wee end of a wooden spoon and then dipped in dark chocolate. Muahahaha, life is good, and sinfully delicious.


For shooting purposes I had to take a bite to show you the insides – what a drag. Then I tried to be a good girl and put it back in the fridge to save for later. Update: I opened the fridge approximately 4 more times to take “just a nibble” before it was all gone – OOPS.

","Beat butter and sugars and in large bowl on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add milk, pumpkin butter and vanilla and mix again until well combined.Add flour, baking soda, salt and pumpkin pie spice and mix on low speed (or with a spoon by hand) until incorporated. Stir in one-third of the chocolate chips (1/2 cup as original recipe is written), cover and chill dough for an hour.Form dough into 1 inch balls around popsicle sticks (mine had spoon ends, which I recommend) and arrange on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper or a silicon baking mat. Place in freezer and let chill for 30 minutes.Melt remaining chocolate chips (1 cup as original recipe is written) over a double boiler with coconut oil (or in microwave in 30-second increments being careful not to overcook).With a large metal spoon, scoop up melted chocolate and dip and swirl the dough balls around in the spoon, coating to cover. Tap pops on side of the bowl to remove excess coating and return to waxed paper-lined baking sheets (or dip in crushed pretzels first). Chill in fridge until set.Store chilled in an airtight container for up to 1 week, or the freezer for several weeks."
898,Chai Spiced Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chai-Spiced Oatmeal Raisin Bars

Oatmeal raisin cookies are John’s favorite cookie, hence the reason I baked them what seemed like every other week when we first got married. Sure, we tied the knot and all, but I still had to make sure the man’s sweet tooth was satisfied. After all, there’s a lot of dessert out there in the world and I want to ensure that he only oogles at my goodies, if you catch my drift


I’ve wanted to infuse the flavor of chai into cookies for a while now and thought this the perfect time since the weather is cooling down, the leaves are starting to turn, and I’ve officially started craving hot tea every single day. And so, a chai infusion it was.

To mock the flavor of chai in these bars, I simply added all of the spices you’d find in traditional chai tea: cinnamon, clove, cardamom and ginger – some of the loveliest spices around if you ask me. And the result was a hearty dessert bar with all of the flavor and texture of a traditional oatmeal raisin cookie but with a punch of chai spice in each bite. Oh man, these are a total win.



","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth.Carefully pour flour, salt and baking soda into a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Add spices and stir. Then add oats and raisins and stir once more.Chill the dough for 5-10 minutes. Then scrape into a buttered, lightly floured OR parchment lined 8x8 metal or glass dish and flatten until smooth (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).Bake for about 25-28 minutes or until nice and golden brown on top and the sides pull away from the pan.Let cool in the pan and then slice and serve.

899,Vegan Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles

When it comes to breakfast, I can hardly decide between which one of my favorites to indulge in on any given day. Oatmeal, pancakes, steel cut oats, french toast – there’s simply too many delicious options to choose from. But if I had to pick just one, besides my true love of pancakes, it’d have to be waffles.

These waffles scream fall in every way: Cornbread, pumpkin, maple syrup, cinnamon – a little taste of autumn in each bite. Plus, both the ingredients list and time required to prepare them remain minimal – just the way I like it.

Oh, and did I mention they’re vegan? I almost left that out. Pumpkin vegan waffles for the win.

What I loved most about these waffles – besides the fact that they were moist and tasted exactly how I’d hoped – is that they have a nice crisp that waffles can sometimes lack. Couple the ideal texture with the rich pumpkin-cornbread flavor and we have near breakfast perfection on our hands.

I topped mine with a little Earth Balance and maple syrup and was smiling bigger with each bite. Just too good to put into words.

If you’re looking for a healthy fall breakfast recipe, give this one a try. You likely already have all of the ingredients on hand, and who can resist a waffle, really?



","Prepare flax egg in a large bowl and set aside for 5 minutes.Add almond milk, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, melted butter, pumpkin pie spice and stir.Add flour and corn mix and whisk until just combined.

900,Vegan Pumpkin Apple Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Apple Muffins

When John and I started dating, one of my favorite things about him, besides his ridiculously good taste in music and his honey-brown eyes, was the fact that he could bake muffins. And I’m not talking about a sissy muffin. I’m talking about a whole wheat, fruit packed, tank of a muffin. Now that’s my kind of man.


He either knew how to make muffins or researched it and figured it out to impress me. Either way, I think he’s worthy of being a keeper.

These muffins are surprisingly simple to throw together, ridiculously moist, full of fall flavor and 100% vegan.

Sautéed apples and plenty of pumpkin puree are the star ingredients in this recipe, with oats and brown sugar playing key supporting roles.

If I had to pick one food to subsist off of (besides bananas, Braum’s coffee ice cream and peanut butter) it would be oats. It’s nature’s perfect food, I’m convinced. Plus, they look so prit-dee on top of overflowing muffins.

This was an experimental recipe but one bite in I knew I’d found a winner. Crazy moist, hints of pumpkin, and little gems of cinnamon-sugar coated apples throughout.

These muffins are healthy, perfect for snacking or for breakfast, delightfully portable, and exactly what you need in your kitchen this fall. Agreed? Agreed.


","Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line muffin tin with paper liners.Prepare flax egg in a large bowl and set aside.Sauté apples in a skillet with non-dairy butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon until soft.

Hey, hey, hey, it’s a dutch baby! Who doesn’t like a dutch baby? Come on…

I attempted my very first dutch baby earlier this year and have been on a dutch roll ever since. First, I dabbled in traditional varieties like blueberry lemon. But now that it’s fall, I can’t get pumpkin flavors off my mind.

This could easily be topped with powdered sugar for a more traditional serving style. But I opted for semisweet chocolate chips and let’s just say that wasn’t a bad decision.

This dutch baby turned out moist, light and rich with pumpkin flavor. A sprinkle of cinnamon and melted chocolate chips made the perfect “frosting,” for this simple breakfast dish for two.

","Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and melt butter in a small skillet over low heat.Add eggs, pumpkin, milk, flour and pumpkin pie spice to blender and blend well. Once oven is preheated, swirl the butter around the skillet to ensure all sides are coated.Add batter to the skillet and place directly in the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.Top with chocolate chips and a sprinkle of ground cinnamon and serve immediately. Powdered sugar is optional."
902,Pumpkin French Toast Bake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin French Toast Bake

Pumpkin french toast = breakfast of champions. Take my word.

Remember my 7-ingredient muesli bread? Well, it’s making another appearance in this pumpkin french toast. Chopped up into cubes, it makes the perfect base for a very fall breakfast.

I’ve always made french toast the traditional route: dip bread into egg batter and fry right when you’re ready to eat. But, making it the day before and baking in the morning is actually a lot easier. Plus, it doesn’t require a griddle and allows the bread plenty of time to soak up the pumpkin-y goodness.

The ‘batter’ consisted of several free range eggs, a healthy dash of milk, a scoop of pumpkin butter and plenty of pumpkin pie spice. Topped with brown sugar and it was good to go.

You guys, it’s possible that I’ve never been so excited to hop up out of bed on a Saturday to preheat my oven. The anticipation nearly stole precious hours of sleep, but it was so, so worth it.

As you can see, it turned out phenomenal. The crusty, raisin-dotted bread soaked up the batter and yielded a custard-like french toast bake that smelled like heaven in the oven.

Topped with a little maple syrup (agave or honey) and it’s phenomenal. Not to mention it could feed your entire family and most of your neighbors. I ended up driving mine around to several friends and sharing a healthy portion. Now they think I’m the “french toast fairy” – not sure that’s a reputation I’m willing – or able – to keep up. Either way, it was fun while it lasted.

If there’s just two of you dining on this breakfast, simply cut the recipe in half or even one-fourth for a more appropriate serving size. Either way, this recipe should be on your fall bucket list. I’m so glad I’ve already crossed it off of mine.

","Cut any kind of bread into 1-inch cubes - I recommend a crusty, whole grain variety, but sandwich bread will work, too. Just use enough slice to fill a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish quite full.In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, pumpkin butter and pie spice until well combined. Pour over bread and push down with a spoon or your hands until it's all soaked and mostly covered. Cover with saran wrap or lid and refrigerate overnight.In the morning, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C), uncover and top with brown sugar, additional pumpkin pie spice and nuts (optional). Bake for 35-45 minutes or until golden brown and no longer wet.Serve immediately with maple syrup, honey or agave nectar. Store leftovers in the refrigerator covered for up to a couple days."
903,Pumpkin Bark | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Bark

You guys, I simply couldn’t resist.

With fall officially upon us, there’s simply not much I can do in the way of restraining my pumpkin fever. And this recipe is one of my favorite creations thus far.

It’s a two-layer bark: dark chocolate on bottom and white chocolate infused with pumpkin pie spice on top. The sprinkles? Almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. How very delectable and healthy.
The flavor combination is exquisite. Plenty of decadence from the dark chocolate, a sweet yet spicy addition from the pumpkin-infused white chocolate, and lots of irresistible crunch from the fruit and nuts.

I took this batch into friends at work and several have already pestered me for the recipe. One even said she’d pay for it! Well well, adoring public, here it is. Pumpkin bark, and it doesn’t get much easier or more delicious.

","In the microwave or over a double boiler, melt the dark chocolate, stirring occasionally. Once melted, pour over a cookie sheet and spread until even - should be a fairly thin layer.Place pan in freezer to harden for at least 10-15 minutes.Rinse your bowl clean and melt the white chocolate chips, stirring occasionally. Once melted, remove from heat and add pumpkin pie spice. Stir until thoroughly mixed.Remove pan from freezer and pour white chocolate over the top of the dark chocolate, moving quickly to spread it carefully in an even layer directly on top. Get the edges as close to lined up as possible.Quickly sprinkle on almonds, pumpkin seeds and cranberries. Pop in freezer for another 10-15 minutes.Then break into pieces and store in an airtight container or bag. Refrigerate to keep fresh for longer."
904,5-Ingredient Pumpkin Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Pumpkin Frappuccino

I like the way my boss puts it: Fall rolls around and the pumpkin spice latte comes back and “everyone loses their damn mind.” Yep, that’s the caffeine crowd I’m catering to today – myself included.

Remember when I made my 3 ingredient mocha frappe a while back? It was such a hit among readers that I decided to recreate it, but this time more fall friendly. I added some pumpkin butter to my milk “ice cubes” using this recipe, which I loosely followed. But if you don’t have pumpkin butter, you can just use pumpkin puree and add a bit more pumpkin pie spice and sweetener, or sub a pumpkin-flavored syrup.

I opted for cold brew coffee that I brewed the night before and strained in the morning, but any chilled espresso or bold roast coffee will do.

Once you add your pumpkin ice cubes to the blender, all you need to add is coffee. Anything else is completely optional: creamer, additional sweetener or spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.).
The result is a creamy, pumpkin frappuccino with plenty of sweet and spice. I opt to call it a pumpkin-cinno. Festive, eh? I believe this would make the perfect beverage for your morning work commute – it certainly does mine.


","To prepare cold brew coffee, place 2 cup ground coffee – the bolder the better – into a bowl, top it with 4 cups of water and place it in the refrigerator overnight. Strain in the morning and reserve the leftover in the fridge.Prepare milk ice cubes in advance by pouring your milk of choice into a bowl and mixing in pumpkin butter, agave nectar and pumpkin pie spice. Whisk to ensure even distribution.Pour mixture into an ice cube tray, covering lightly with saran wrap, and freezing overnight.Choose non-dairy milk to make this vegan friendly. I went with 2% for an extra creamy texture.In the morning, place 1 cup coffee and 8-10 pumpkin ice cubes in a blender and blend until smooth (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Taste and add a packet of stevia or extra agave if you prefer a sweeter beverage. Additionally, add more pumpkin pie spice or pumpkin butter if you prefer a spicier flavor.Optional but recommended: Top with whipped cream and cinnamon for serving."
905,Vegan Snickers Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Snickers Pancakes

When I was a little girl, I used to love going shopping with my mom. We’d play music in the car, both get a little something for ourselves, and there was almost always some kind of dessert involved.
If it was Dairy Queen, Mom would get a chocolate dip cone every time; I’d opt for the grape star kiss (total fail now that I think about it). If it was Braum’s, dirt sundae for me every time. But if it was the grocery store, there was no question about it: I was getting a Snickers.

Snickers have always been my favorite candy bar for four reasons: nougat, peanut, chocolate, caramel; enough said.

These pancakes mock those flavors precisely, but in a healthier, more vegan sort of way.

Think warm, pillowy vegan pancakes studded with salty peanuts and plenty of chocolate chips.

Then topped off with vegan caramel and served warm and melty for morning delight.

Though I’d been dreaming up ways to approach this recipe for what seems like months, I finally came to the conclusion that it doesn’t have to be that complicated: Simply draw in the flavors most prevalent in Snickers in a creative way while keeping it as healthy and delicious as possible.

I don’t wanna brag or anything but…NAILED IT.


These cakes turned out lovely. Fluffy vanilla pancakes with a sprinkle of oats and a touch of whole grain, lots of salty peanuts paired with bittersweet chocolate, and a hit-you-in-your-mouth syrup in the form of homemade vegan caramel sauce. This is a breakfast I won’t be forgetting anytime soon.



","Turn griddle to medium heat.Combine flours, oats, baking powder, salt and sugar in a large bowl.Add soy milk and canola oil and stir until just combined. Add more oats or flour if the batter appears a bit too runny.Add half of peanuts and chocolate chips and stir, reserving the rest for serving.Spoon 1/4 cup measurements of batter onto the lightly greased griddle. Flip when bubbles appear on top or the edges look dry. Cook 1-2 minutes more.To serve, stack desired number of pancakes with peanuts and chocolate chips in between each layer. Top with additional chocolate and peanuts, as well as a drizzle of caramel sauce.Add sugar and water to a saucepan over medium heat, cooking until dark amber in color. Don't stir, instead swirl the pan carefully - about 15 minutes.Once you've achieved the dark amber color, reduce heat to low and slide the saucepan slightly off the burner. Slowly add creamer and salt, stirring with a wooden spoon.Transfer to a glass bowl or jar to cool and store covered in the refrigerator for up to a week or two."
906,Peach Vegan Cupcakes + Buttercream Frosting | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peach Cupcakes with Honey Buttercream Frosting

A few weeks back we had a wedding shower to attend. Two of our very best friends are tying le knot in early October. John’s the best man; I’m the unofficial caterer to the bride. The couple has promised, nay, demanded we dance at the reception. They’re serving our home-roasted coffee. It shall be a blast.


For the shower, I wanted to bring treats – it’s simply my nature. My mom used to bring cupcakes in a cone to my school class for my birthday. You’d think that alone would’ve made me the coolest kid in school, but when you factor in my mushroom cut, painfully shy demeanor and 6 crooked teeth all fighting for front row spots, that couldn’t be any further from the truth. That’s OK, things took an upswing in middle school. Who needs third grade popularity anyway?

These cupcakes feature two whole peaches, plenty of vegan baked goodness, cake cones and honey buttercream. Quite the rag-tag team if you ask me.

Peaches and honey are simply meant to be together, like peanut butter and basil, wine and sitcoms, and Saturdays and sleeping in. You can imagine a cupcake + buttercream marriage is even more dreamy than the pair in its natural state. Trust, I know my sugary treats.

My cupcakes had a superb showing at the shower. Three down in the first 10 minutes and the rest not long after. I heard lots of moaning, plenty of “what is this?!” and several “ugh, sooo gooooods.” You know that’s a good sign.
While I can’t guarantee these will make you popular among your former third grade peers, they will make you some new friends now, even if they’re just using you for your sweet, delectable honey buttercream frosting.


","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).Whisk together the soy milk and vinegar in a large bowl, and set aside for a few minutes to curdle. Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla extract to the soy milk mixture and beat until foamy. Add peach puree and stir.Next, carefully add flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt to a sifter and sift over wet ingredients. Beat until no large lumps remain.Place ice cream cones in a muffin pan and carefully scoop batter into the cones, filling almost all the way full.Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Transfer to a flat surface and let cool completely. Rinse your bowl out while the cupcakes are baking to make buttercream frosting in.Cream together butter and honey.Add half of the powdered sugar and mix on low speed until the sugar is incorporated. Then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy.Add last cup of powdered sugar, mixing on low speed at first and then on higher speed until creamy - about 2 minutes more.Add almond milk and mix once more.Add additional powdered sugar or almond milk as needed for desired consistency.Makes more than enough to generously frost 10-12 cupcakes (as original recipe is written)"
907,7-Ingredient Muesli Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Muesli Bread

When I think of homemade bread, I think of lazy Sunday mornings spent covered in flour with messy hair and no intention of showering. When the bread comes out of the oven, I slice that perfect piece out of the middle and slather it with butter and jam. Accompanied by an egg and a cup of good coffee, a simple weekend meal doesn’t get much better.


When John and I were living in Portland, we discovered the absolute best coffee shop in town. Yes, there are plenty: West coasters take their coffee seriously. But we found the absolute best.
Its name is Heart. Nestled in a little strip on Burnside sits the quaint little black and white shop with huge window fronts, a giant exposed roaster in the center of the store, newspapers strewn about in messy stacks, a staff of blasé hipsters, and the best lattes in the world. What does this have to do with bread? A lot, in fact.

Heart Coffee is all about supporting local, as are most Portland businesses, which is why they carried the only the freshest local baked goods from around the area. Homemade whoopie pies, cinnamon rolls, giant wrapped muffins with berries plump and gushing out the side, and – our favorite – muesli toast.

Muesli simply means mixed granola – fruit, nuts, seeds, oats; whatever suits your fancy. But what few people experience is muesli in toast, which creates a euphoric combination of flavors and a sensational crunch that makes you resent regular toasts forevermore. Slather your slice with butter and honey and you have a near-perfect breakfast in tow.

Every Sunday morning before church, John and I would invite friends to meet us at Heart for coffee and a chat. Sometimes no one was quite awake. Sometimes it was too loud to hear yourself talk. Sometimes no one showed up but us. But there was always, always a fresh loaf of muesli bread waiting to be thick sliced, toasted, and served alongside soft butter and local honey.
Pair that with a perfectly-crafted latte and Sunday mornings were never so awesome as this.

This loaf is a rustic style, but you could easily split into two small loaf pans to pull off a more formal shape. I, however, prefer the former.

The little raisins puffed out the side, which reminded me why it’s smart to keep them toward the center of the loaf. Else they get crisp and require dusting off before eating. Consider yourself tipped off to this little trick. Your thanks, my welcome.

I was so pleased with the way this batch turned out. Crusty on the outside, warm and soft on the inside with plenty of crunchy, sweet notes from the fruit and nuts. I lathered mine with a little butter and honey and it was a dream. But once it sets for a few days, it makes the perfect base for a french toast bake (recipe to come soon).


","Combine warm water (like bath water, or 110 degrees F / 43 C), yeast, salt and flours in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. If using a stand mixer, beat at medium speed for about a minute. Otherwise just use a spoon to stir until well combined.Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise in the refrigerator for two hours. Alternatively, let rise for 2 hours at room temp and 2 hours in the fridge. I went straight for the fridge to save time.Once risen, lightly sprinkle the dough with flour and transfer to a floured work surface. Knead a few times and then add pumpkin seeds, almonds and raisins. Knead until just combined, trying to keep the add-ins on the inside of the loaf, or else they’ll get too crisp while baking.Place on parchment-lined baking stone or lightly greased baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; to help keep the dough moist. Let rest for 45-60 minutes.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (232 C) while the dough rests. Place a metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready.When ready to bake, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ½-inch deep.Place bread in oven and carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, or until deep, golden brown.Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a rack. Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temp."
908,Cucumber Cooler Cocktails | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cucumber Cooler Cocktails

It might seem like we’re quite the lush pair here at Minimalist Baker, but that really isn’t the case. We simply enjoy a quality cocktail every now and again, especially when it’s light, delicious and easy to make. This cucumber cooler is no exception.


When my boss was in town a few weeks ago, we all went out for drinks. It was the perfect evening really. Late summer, still warm enough to forgo a jacket, the service was spot-on, the live music was the best I’ve ever heard in Wichita, and the cocktails? Rather a dream.

John ordered a drink featuring cucumber slices and after one sip, I was quickly regretting my pinot noir. In fact, every time he turned to talk to my boss, I’d sneak sips. Rather sneaky, I am.

This recipe is as simple as it gets: gin, lime, mint, cucumber and tonic water. Even the novice bartender can throw this together at the amazement of onlooking guests. Plus, it’s easy to modify to suit each person’s taste, allowing you to please even the pickiest of palettes. For example, John prefers sour, I prefer sweet – bring on the sugar.

In just a few minutes we had a lovely cocktail on our hands. And it seemed the longer we sipped on it the better it became as the flavors were given more time to marry.




What does it taste like? A sophisticated limeade. An upgraded mojito. Cucumber water on steroids. Just try it, you will love.


","Add mint, lime, gin, and sugar (if using) to shaker and muddle.Add cucumber slices to shaker and shake vigorously.Pour mixture over glass filled with ice and top with tonic water.Stir, let set for a few minutes for the flavors to enhance and enjoy."
909,Strawberry Cake Magic Shell | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Cake Magic Shell

Once upon a time a little girl was born and she grew up to love ice cream, very very much.

So much so, in fact, that it became a staple in her diet, even through her years at university.

But one too many trips to a certain soft serve machine in the cafeteria left her feeling worse for the wear and regretting her sweet tooth quite dreadfully.

So she tried as she might to give up sweets. But after months of saying ‘no’ to her favorite frozen dessert in an attempt to practice restraint, she finally gave in and the two were reunited once again. (cue: *embrace*)

“I knew you always loved me,” the ice cream said. “I’ll never quit you again, I promise,” the girl exclaimed.

From that day forward there wasn’t a week that went by that the girl didn’t have an ice cream cone at least once.

And the two lived happily ever – with sprinkles. The end.

","Heat the chocolate chips and coconut oil over a double boiler. Stir until melted, and then add strawberry cake mix.Stir until the mixture is combined, and then add a drop or two of red food coloring until you've reached your desired shade of pink.Serve immediately over ice cream, frozen yogurt, or frozen bananas."
910,White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes

The reason I made these pancakes is simple: I love white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.
I worked at a sandwich shop as a college student and I always volunteered to bake the cookies for the day. Know why? Playing with cookie dough (&lt;–awesome) lends itself to white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts falling to the bottom of the box as “waste” (&lt;–double awesome).
Guess what? I had to clump them together with some cookie dough and eat it as a snack (&lt;–unspeakably awesome).


Whoever discovered this flavor combination deserves a treat. Like a pancake. Hey, I have that!

In all seriousness, this pancake recipe is ridiculously simple. And if you love white chocolate macadamia nut cookies you simply must make them. Cookies for breakfast? I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. You seem to be in full support.

These pancakes are not only simple but also vegan, assuming you can get your hands on some non-dairy white chocolate chips, which shouldn’t be too hard in this day and age.

As always, this pancake recipe is free of butter and eggs and very limited in added sugar and oil. While these cakes don’t have the crisp, crumbly texture of their cookie twins, the melty chocolate chips and fluffy, nutty layers more than make up for it.

Top your stack with a few melty white chocolate chips and a little agave nectar or maple syrup for good measure and you’ll be in pancake pleasure town in no time. Trust me, I went there and it’s awesome.








","Preheat griddle or skillet to medium heat.Combine wet ingredients in a large bowl. Then add dry ingredients to a sifter and sift into the wet (excluding white chocolate and macadamia nuts).Stir batter until just combined and no large lumps remain, then add white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts and stir. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.Spoon 1/4-cup measurements onto a lightly greased griddle.

911,Mint Citrus White Wine Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mint and Citrus White Wine Sangria

I wasn’t always a wine drinker. In fact, it took a little convincing by my husband before I ventured past the one, safe merlot I was clinging to. Stupid me. I should’ve opened up the floodgates to wine years ago. Well, now I sound like a lush – at least we got that out of the way.

The summer we lived in Portland our friends invited us to their wedding followed by one of the most perfect receptions I’ve ever attended. There was a tent. There were close friends. There was an angry mob across the street protesting foie gras. There was dancing to bluegrass music even though no one knew what the hell they were doing. There was lemon blueberry and chocolate ganache cake, which I embraced two slices of. And, there was sangria.

Sangria is delicate, refreshing, and sweet. It’s the perfect afternoon drink and especially lovely for a wine novice that’s not quite used to the dry taste it can sometimes leave behind. It is colorful, it is beautiful, it is a party in a glass. In other words, it is the unofficial queen of the wine scene.

This particular recipe was inspired by my love for all things citrus and, of course, mint. I could eat mint and basil by the handful, hence the reason they pop up on Minimalist Baker so often.
To prepare this sangria, you’ll need a dry white wine, lime, lemon, simple syrup, and mint. We opted for a pinot grigio, deciding a chardonnay wouldn’t complement the citrus as well.

The result is a refreshing white sangria with plenty of lemon-lime flavor and the slightest hint of mint. But if you love mint as much as we do, feel free to add more. We won’t judge.

","Prepare simple syrup by mixing sugar and water in a small dish and microwaving for 30-second increments until sugar is dissolved. Alternatively, prepare a large batch on the stovetop using a 1:1 sugar-water ratio and reserve for later use.Once simple syrup is ready, add 1 Tablespoon to each wine glass. Then add mint leaves and stir/lightly muddle. Next add several slices each of lemon and lime.Top off with wine and let set for a few minutes so the flavors can meld together. Top off with more wine and citrus as needed."

No-Bake Cookie Sprinkles!!!!


Or, sprankles as I like to call them. They’re essentially my No-Bake Cookie Bars only not in bar form. I keep them crumbly so I can add them to things like yogurt, almond butter toast and pancakes!

These pancakes are a spin-off of my Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes, which have made close to 200,000 friends on Pinterest. Gee, must be their charm…or their ooey gooey chocolate chip frosting.

The base of these cakes is banana and oats, which cuts the need for sugar and hardly any flour. Then, we add a healthy scoop of cocoa powder to the mix and plenty of no bake cookie sprinkles, and the result? A refined sugar-, butter-free stack of goodness that nearly passes as a straight up no bake cookie. Breakfast of champions? Uhh, yes please!




","*To prepare no-bake cookie sprinkles, pulse 9 dates, 1/4 cup oats, 1 1/2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter, and 1/4 cup chocolate chips in food processor until small crumbles remain and transfer to a bowl (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).Preheat a skillet to medium-low heat and prepare flax egg by mixing flaxseed meal and water and letting set for 3-5 minutes.Mash your very ripe banana with baking powder.Add flax egg, oil, salt, vanilla, and almond milk and stir.Stir in oats, flour and cocoa powder until just combined.Add no bake cookie sprinkles and fold gently. Add more almond milk if too thick.Scoop 1/4 cup measurements onto lightly greased griddle.Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side.

First things first. I have two very important announcements:
1) Today I’m releasing my 7 Ingredients or Less E-Cookbook and it’s FREE for download!
2) I figured out how to make bars that taste just like a NO BAKE COOKIE!
Both of these items are very important.

When I tell you these bars taste just like a no bake cookie, I’m not playing around.
I REPEAT: This is not a joke.

No bake cookies are the bomb. For the record, they nor the word “bomb” will ever go out of style.
My mother can attest that no bakes are my kryptonite. I’m rendered defenseless in their presence.
I once jumped up and down like a little girl when someone brought a plate to class…IN HIGH SCHOOL.
I repeat: NOT JOKING AROUND.

When I recently discovered the wonder that is medjool dates, I almost cried.
Adding them to any recipe makes it sweet as pie and replaces any need for added sugar.
So picture this: dates, peanut butter, dark chocolate chips, oats, a.k.a no-bake cookie in the mouth.
Oh yes, we’re going there.

These bars are nutritious and super simple, yet taste just like one of my favorite desserts. And with just four ingredients, you really can’t go wrong.
I’ve already made them three times since discovering their magic factor. At batch #5 I think I’ll have a problem, but we’re not quite there yet so, we’re good.

","Pulse dates in a food processor until they’re in small pieces; about 15 generous pulses.Add oats, chocolate chips, and peanut butter and pulse or mix until combined. You want there to be consistently small pieces but not overly processed.Transfer to a 9x9 or larger pan and press down until uniformly flat (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).Pop in freezer for 15 minutes to set.

914,Ginger and Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Candied Ginger &amp; Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies

I have this little crush on cookies. Not the coy kind of crush that lends itself to sweet little nibbles and quiet, playful stares. No, the kind that leads you into in a closet by yourself where you compulsively eat 15 cookies before coming to the realization of what just happened. Yeah, that kind of crush; the 7-minutes in heaven type.

I also have a wee little crush on Joy the Baker. So when she posted a recipe recently for ginger walnut chocolate blondies, I started drooling all over the keyboard and simultaneously kneeling down of my computer with arms raised chanting, “All hail Joy! All hail Joy!” Or something like that.
And then I promptly scuttled off to the kitchen to figure out how to candy ginger and then pump it into cookies – bite-sized pillowy little clouds of butter-infused goodness. Come to mama.

It turns out candying ginger isn’t that difficult. DON’T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS.
All you need is some fresh ginger, sugar, water and patience.
Chop, boil, simmer, dry, and coat in sugar – it’s as simple as that.
Then throw the little gems into cookie batter and wait anxiously as they cook to perfection in the oven.
See that bite right there? Down there? It took all the self control in my cookie-loving body not to inhale that entire thing along with the other half dozen on the rack. I mean, candied ginger and sea salt chocolate chip cookies? COME ON.

If you’re a fan of ginger, you must make these cookies.
If you’re not a fan of ginger, you must make these cookies.
Trust me, you might just fall in love. My unassuming coworkers wolfed down the entire bag I set out in the break room with nothing more than a suspicious hot pink sticky note vaguely indicating what they were. Project mystery cookie drop, SUCCESS.



","To candy ginger, peel and thinly slice fresh ginger, then add to a saucepan with equal parts water and sugar.

Lastly, toss in white sugar.To make the cookies, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).Cream butter and sugars together. Then add egg and vanilla and mix again.Add dry ingredients a little at a time, mixing as you go. Lastly, fold in chocolate chunks and chopped candied ginger.Scoop into rounded 1 Tbsp. balls and place on cookie sheet.

Decadent dark chocolate.
Well, good morning, sunshine!

I’ve wanted to recreate a “frappe” or frappuccino at home for a while now since I had a full on obsession with them when they came out in like 2004. But after learning that they had enough calories to sink a boat I strayed back to my americano. Whew, muffin top averted.

If you’ve never had cold brew coffee you should.
The way I make it you grind bold coffee, put it in a large bowl with water, then slide it in the fridge overnight. The next morning you have fresh coffee awaiting you beside your gallon of milk and half-used carton of eggs. Easy – it’s like stowing away a personal barista in your kitchen without the temptation of an 1,800 calorie muffin on the side. Oh delight!

So in the morning, you strain your coffee. I did ours in our Chemex, which is bomb. But can also do it over cheesecloth and a strainer, or in a french press. Then you add it to a blender with frozen milk cubes and a dash of chocolate syrup, and wa-la! You have a cold brew frappe that rivals any coffee house offering. Good morning indeed.





","To prepare cold brew, place 2 cups ground coffee - the bolder the better - into a bowl, top it with 4 cups of water and place it in the refrigerator overnight. Strain in the morning and reserve the leftover in the fridge.Prepare milk ice cubes in advance by pouring your milk of choice in an ice cube tray, covering lightly with saran wrap, and freezing over night.

916,French Toast Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"French Toast Sugar Cookies

Attention: These cookies taste like french toast, but they also taste just like a brown sugar cinnamon Pop Tart. In other words, childhood, reclaimed!

They’re insanely delicious pillowy clouds of cinnamon-y, maple goodness and I could not wait to share them with you.

The initial idea was to make a french toast cookie, and I think I achieved that.
Cinnamon cookie + maple buttercream frosting = edible gold.
But I also think I figured out a much less tedious way to make homemade Pop Tarts. Exciting, right?! I mean…come on.


I took these to a summer BBQ at work and the entire pan was annihilated within the hour. All that was missing from the experience for me was that I wasn’t sitting at home by myself, watching a Netflix movie in my fat pants dunking my cookies into a giant glass of whole milk.
Now that would’ve been a complete cookie-eating experience, no doubt.

I highly recommend them as an afternoon treat or a late-night indulgence. Dunk them in milk, have them with coffee, sandwich two together, wrap them in foil and give them to a friend. If not for the suspicious packaging, they’d think you handed them two fluffy, cinnamon Pop Tarts. Friendship: solidified.
Yes, I’m saying that these cookies will make you friends. There, I said it.

917,Watermelon Limeade Cocktails | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Watermelon Limeade Cocktails

Friends, I’m not much of a bartender, but this cocktail is BANGIN’.

I dreamt it up one day while fighting a serious watermelon craving.
I wondered if, when sliced, watermelon would form into delicious little ice cubes. It turns out, it does.
All hail the frozen cocktail!

To make this delicious beverage you need just 5 ingredients: Watermelon, limes, sugar, white rum, and club soda. That’s it!

Simply muddle a lime with rum and sugar, add watermelon ice cubes and juice, and top it off with club soda.
You’ll be in grown-up limeade heaven in no time.

The best part about this cocktail – besides the fact that it takes no time to throw together – is that the watermelon ice cubes get all melty and boozy and make the perfect treat to munch on as you sip the drink down.
Sure, you may look like a fool maneuvering a straw to slide watermelon cubes up the side of your glass directly into your mouth, but it’s totally worth any embarrassment you may experience.

We enjoyed these drinks alongside tacos one night, and the combination was just outstanding. When our glasses were empty, we were quickly left wanting more. So be prepared to provide plenty of refills for your adoring guests.



","Slice 3/4 of a seedless watermelon into cubes, reserving one quarter for juice, and place in a bag and freeze for several hours or preferably overnight.In a strainer over a bowl, press the remaining chunks of fresh watermelon with a muddler or flat surface until most of the juice is extracted.Slice limes into quarters and squeeze the juice of one fruit into each serving glass, throwing the limes into the glass along with it. (Only use half of a lime instead of 2 medium limes if you prefer a drink that's not as tart.)Add 1 tbsp sugar and one shot (2 Tbsp // 30 ml) of white rum to each serving glass and muddle until well mixed.Fill to the brim with watermelon ice cubes, add a healthy splash of watermelon juice (about 1/4 cup), and top off with club soda.Stir, garnish with lime wedge, and serve with a straw."
918,Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Waffles
Sometimes life just calls for a waffle. Just like life sometimes calls for a naked Saturday or an evening of doing nothing but eating ice cream and watching touching documentaries on Netflix that make you cry over people’s personal triumphs. Because sometimes, all that will scratch that itch in life is a little self-indulgence.


While I would put these waffles in the “indulge” category, they’re definitely a healthy indulgence. With no added sugar besides the chocolate chips, plenty of fiber from old fashioned oats, and tons of banana flavor from two whole bananas, I don’t feel one ounce of guilt for having these as a weekday treat or a slow weekend breakfast; and you shouldn’t either.

I named these banana bread waffles for a reason: They are a quicker way to make banana bread that mocks the flavor to a ‘T.’ Plus, anytime there’s chocolate chips in the mix, I say it’s a party. So consider this a (healthy) breakfast party, in the mouth.

They’re easy to make, requiring just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and simple ingredients. Plus, they’re gluten-free friendly andnaturally sweet (minus the chocolate chips)!

We hope you LOVE these waffles! They’re:
Crisp on the outside
Tender on the inside
Packed with banana bread flavor
Easy to make
&amp; SO delicious!

NOTE: Recipe updated 3/4/19 to improve texture, address waffles sticking to waffle iron, and to be made gluten-free friendly!
","To prepare flax egg, combine flaxseed and water in a medium (to large) mixing bowl, stir and allow to sit for a few minutes to thicken.Once thickened, add peeled bananas and baking powder to the flax egg and mash well with a fork until only small chunks remain.Add in oil and whisk to combine. Then add dairy-free milk and stir to combine.Next add salt, oats and stir. Then add gluten-free flour and stir until just combined. Add in chocolate chips and stir once more. The batter should be cake-like. Slightly thick but pourable (not runny). When you dip a mixing spoon into it, it should leave soft peaks. If too thin, add more gluten-free flour and stir. If too thick, thin with a little dairy-free milk and stir.Let batter rest 5 minutes while preheating waffle iron.Once iron is ready, spray with cooking spray (not necessary if your waffle iron is non-stick like ours).  Add 1 scant cup of batter to the waffle iron (adjust based on size of waffle iron) and cook according to manufacturer instructions (ours took about 5 minutes to cook through and get crispy on the outside).Remove from waffle iron with a fork and set aside on an oven rack or serving plate. You can place in a 200-degree F (93 C) oven to keep warm while continuing to cook the cook rest of the batter. Be sure not to stack the waffles to prevent them from getting soggy.To serve, we suggest topping with a few more chocolate chips, vegan butter or nut butter, and/or maple syrup (all optional).Cool leftovers before storing. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days, but preferably they should be stored in a single layer in the freezer (in a freezer-safe storage bag or container) up to 1 month. Reheat in a hot oven, toaster oven, or microwave until crisp and warm."
919,Strawberry Danish French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Danish French Toast

Going into donut shops was one of my greatest joys in life as a kid. I knew exactly what I wanted every time: maple long john with chocolate milk with a back-up plan of anything chocolate glazed or pink and covered in sprinkles. Gold, every time.

But these days, my palette is much more refined. I go for the frosting-free kinds, the ones without holes, and certainly avoid anything with the terms ‘long’ and ‘john’ in it. They’re just plain childish.
Nah, just kidding. My donut preferences haven’t changed at all since I was a kid. In fact, they’ve probably gotten worse. But every now and then it’s good to branch out and ‘upgrade’ as we age. And if that means adding a strawberry danish to the rotation every once in a while, I’m OK with that. Not all changes are bad, after all. Although bangs, bangs are usually a bad idea – especially for us greasy forehead types. Too, much, oil.

But enough about donuts and who shouldn’t wear bangs and onto the finer things in life, like french toast. When it comes to this breakfast classic, I’m usually the ‘give-it-to-me’ straight type: plain with a little butter and a drizzle of syrup. But these days, I’m upgrading to classier flavors, i.e. strawberry danish.
Once I discovered the flavor pairing of goat cheese and strawberry, the idea was to apply it to as many foods as I could think of. And the first one that happened to cross my mind was french toast. And the result? French toast that tastes just like a strawberry, cream cheese danish. Now that’s the type of breakfast I’m willing to branch out for.

","Preheat griddle to medium.Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon in a shallow dish.Dip bread into mixture and place on lightly greased hot griddle. Drizzle remaining 'batter' on top of bread.Cook until well-browned on each side, about 2 minutes.Remove and plate. Top immediately with goat cheese, strawberries, and a drizzle of honey."

While some long to slide out of their shoes and too-tight work pants when they get home from a day at the office, I long to get in the kitchen. Busy evenings are my muse, along with pancakes, ice cream, and freshly-washed strawberries. Other topics for other days, I suppose.

So upon returning from a particularly busy day at the office, I checked the “dinner menu” hanging on the fridge as it were, and saw I’d written “shrimp pasta” on Tuesday. And who am I to go back on my word? Pasta it was.

Confession: I’ve used jarred sauces on my pasta before. Cue: shrill cries, eye rolls and stone throwing. Yada yada yada. But you have to admit, on occasion convenience wins over quality, just like every morning in high school when a pack of chocolate donut gems won over eggs and toast. Time, is, money.
Until I perfected this recipe, I went the convenience route when it came to my pasta. But once you’ve tasted homemade, you’ll never go back. In addition to this version taking only 15 minutes or less to throw together, it also requires no butter, no cream and packs a ton of delicious and zesty flavor from parmesan cheese, garlic, pesto and a pinch of red pepper flake.

","Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C).Heat medium to large saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and garlic, stirring quickly to ensure it doesn't burn.Next, add milk and veggie broth and stir.Then, begin adding 1 Tbsp of flour at a time, stirring with a whisk to reduce clumps. I recommend starting with 2-3 Tbsp (as original recipe is written) and adding more later if needed. You can also thicken with extra parmesan cheese. Add salt, pepper, red pepper flake, pesto, cheese and stir.Bring a pot to a boil and cook pasta at this time. Drain and set aside.Reduce heat on sauce slightly and let simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you notice the sauce is too thin, add a little more flour. If too thick, add a little more milk.In the meantime, split your ciabatta roll in half and butter lightly. Slice it into thick strips, add the parmesan, garlic powder and mozzarella and place in the oven on a baking sheet.Watch closely - it should only take 5 minutes to toast up. Remove from oven when lightly browned and cheese is melted.If you have clumps in your sauce at this point (I usually have a few), pour mixture into a blender and puree until smooth. Then return to saucepan, add your favorite pasta, toss and serve immediately."
921,Vegan Coffee Donuts (No Pan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Espresso Glazed Vegan Donuts (No Pan Required)

Being a baker is serious work. The precise measurements, complex ingredients and stacks of complicated equipment can make the task seem too much worth the effort at times. But if you’re like me, that’s half the fun. And tasting the final product makes it all worth it.
And, if you’re like me, you also don’t bother with all the extras, i.e. piping bags, frosting tips, Kitchenaid mixers, quesadilla makers, panini presses, emulsifiers, popover molds, culinary torches, etc., etc. You stick to the basics and make it work, just like any real ‘Merican baker would. Plus, who has space for all that junk anyways? Not I. Not little ‘ol minimalist I.


Something I’ve strongly considered buying multiple times in the past is a donut pan. Everyone has one, they’re all the rage, they make beautiful donuts, and they allow you to skip the frying process and opt for baking instead, which is obviously way healthier than drowned in oil.
But you know what? I really hate buying things, especially unnecessary things like pans that can only do one thing and take up a crapload of space. Just this week I had cooking spray on my grocery list but passed it up because it was $3 instead of the normal $1.50. Yeah, nevermind – didn’t need it that bad. So you can imagine I ruled out a donut pan for the same reasons.

But then there’s the fact that I’m a donut lover, so what do I do with that? (maple long johns anyone?)
I’ll tell you what you do with that. When you love something you find a way to get it, see it, make it, find it, do it. So that’s just what I did. I crafted a recipe that a) didn’t require a donut pan, b) maintained its vegan composure, and c) tasted lip-smacking delicious. And? It’twas a success.

","Bring soy milk, oil, maple syrup or agave, and sugar to a boil in a small sauce pan.Once boiling, remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm or 110 degrees F / 43 C (30 minutes)Once cooled, stir in yeast and let set for 5-10 minutes.In a large bowl, add flour (starting with lesser end of range) and salt, then add to wet mixture and stir, mixing well, then covering with a towel and letting rise in a warm place for 1 hour.Once doubled in size, add the remaining flour (1/2 cup as original recipe is written // or until the dough is no longer incredibly sticky). Mix well and then let the dough sit for about 10 minutes.On a floured surface make about 2-inch balls and place them on a lightly greased cookie sheet, leaving room for expansion.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and cover with light towel while warming.Once preheated, bake for 10-11 minutes, being careful not to over bake as you don't want the bottoms too brown.Prepare glaze and streusel while baking. Once donuts are done, let them cool slightly and then dunk in glaze and cover with streusel. I put the streusel on both top and bottom, and would recommend it for best flavor.Serve immediately for best result, or store in air-tight container for up to 2 days."
922,Chocolate Cashew Larabar Cookie Pops | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Cashew Cookie Larabar Pops

One of my favorite things about this blog is that I get to share my favorite flavor pairings with you. Peanut butter basil, banana chocolate chip, sweet peanut sauce and spicy sriracha, and now: cranberry, cashew and chocolate.


I discovered the beauty of cranberries cashews and chocolate on a random lunchbreak at work recently.
I’d gone out to a shaded bench with a few people in my co-working space, and as ‘dessert’ to my hummus and veggies, I packed a handful of raw cashews, dark chocolate chips and dried cranberries. The result? A flavor combination I wasn’t quite prepared for.
Simple yet insanely delicious, so much so that I felt compelled to stop mid-bite, examine my tiny handful, and announce to my friends that they needed to try it immediately. Out of that moment, this little recipe was born.
Another food love of mine is Larabars. I still remember when my sister discovered them and quickly turned me on to the apple pie flavor. The experience was just short of life changing. Ever since then recipes have been popping up on how to recreate them at home. So when I discovered my most recent flavor pairing, I knew I had to combine the two loves to make one beautiful recipe. And that, I did.

","Place cashews in food processor and process until they're in small pieces, but not as fine as flour. You still want some chunks. Empty into bowl and set aside.Process dates until small pieces form and they're sticky.Add back in ground cashews, cranberries and chocolate chips. Mix or pulse until well combined.Open lid and grab a small handful and squeeze to see if the mixture sticks together. If it's still too crumbly, add a few more dates and process.Scrape mixture into a bowl, then take 1 Tbsp measurements and form them into balls, letting the heat from your hand melt it together. Don't roll them in your hands, but rather form them into balls carefully.Place balls on a cookie sheet and refrigerate. Add skewers or Popsicle sticks once chilled and store at room temperate in plastic bag or Tupperware to keep fresh."
923,Vegan Oreo Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Oreo Cookie Pancakes

You guys, I can’t even begin to tell you how excited I am about this recipe. Ever since the wild success of my Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Pancakes (which are a must-try, by the way) my brain’s been spinning non-stop coming up with new and exciting breakfast recipes. And this one? This is one I simply couldn’t wait to share. And would you believe it’s healthy and simple to make?


Everyone likes Oreos right? And if you don’t, I mean come on, seriously?
These pancakes emulate this childhood favorite perfectly, but are completely vegan, easy to prepare and 100 percent delicious. The creamy vanilla ‘frosting’ is a simple base of coconut butter with a few added ingredients, and the chocolate pancakes feature dark chocolate cocoa powder for a decadent touch without tons of calories.

From start to finish, these cakes take about 15 minutes, which means they can easily be made on hurried weekday mornings – a theory I successfully tested out this week before work. Alternatively, they’d make a blissful weekend treat that would take your lazy Sundays to a whole new level of awesome. Like, seriously.

For pretty photos purposes, I stuffed these guys full of creamy filling. But to keep these within a reasonable calorie limit, I’d suggest spreading it a little thinner. Post photo shoot, I removed quite a bit (with some heavy finger licking) and they were still incredibly delicious without the extra fluff.

","FROSTING - Using a food processor, mix the coconut flakes until they form coconut butter. Scrape down the sides as necessary. It may not come to a full paste but it should be near creamy. (Start your pancake batter while it's mixing)Once creamy, add vanilla and powdered sugar and mix again.While the mixture is processing, add in splashes of coconut milk until it resembles a creamy frosting that retains a little thickness.BATTER - Heat a skillet over medium-low heat.Mix milk, oil and vanilla in a small bowl and set aside.Whisk the flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, sugar and salt in a separate bowl until combined.Add the liquid to the dry and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined. Add a touch more milk if it's too thick.Drop small scoops of batter onto the lightly greased skillet. When bubbles start to peak through the surface and you see a bit of light browning/crisping up on the underside, flip the pancakes over carefully, about 2-3 minutes.Repeat on the other side, remove from the pan.Top pancakes with as much frosting as desired. I found a small spoonful between each later was plenty."
924,Peanut Butter and Basil Milkshake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter and Basil Milkshake

Before you shudder, turn away and never return to this blog, know that this recipe is totally worthy of your attention. I told you before that I wasn’t done with the peanut butter and basil combination and for good reason. The two were meant to be together, perhaps more than PB &amp; J. They’re a mind-blowingly delicious combination. Throw ice cream in the mix and you have a cocktail for perfection. This is no lie.


If you thought my PB &amp; Basil Sandwich was a little out there, this may be your sweet gateway drug into peanut butter basil neverland. The flavors meld together so perfectly in this shake that your guests will be left wondering what’s inside. But it’ll be so delicious they won’t care. It can be out little secret. Our delicious little secret.

I made this recipe using regular vanilla ice cream but it could also be made vegan friendly with soy, almond or coconut-based vanilla ice cream and non-dairy milk. And while I used peanut butter powder, the real stuff could be subbed in if you don’t have the powder on hand. Just put your spin on it to make it your own.

","Blend all of the ingredients together, washing basil beforehand if necessary.If you prefer a thicker shake, add more ice cream. If you prefer a thinner consistency, add a little more milk.Top with a little more peanut butter, basil and a swirl of whipped cream and serve immediately (in chilled glasses if possible)."
925,Veggie Pasta with Tomato Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Color Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce

I love pasta, but I don’t love the carb heaviness it can leave me with afterwards. In fact, just this week I ate one small pancake at Bob’s Red Mill and on the way home I felt tired enough for a nap after only being up for about 3 hours.
So my simple solution to off-setting the carbs is to sub in vegetables for two-thirds of the noodles. This not only makes the dish lighter in general, but also provides another two to three servings of vegetables which pretty much benefits everyone whether they like it or not (i.e. husbands).


I’ve used carrots for 100 percent of the noodles in a pasta dish before but it ultimately left me feeling unsatisfied. So by mixing carrots and zucchini ribbons in with whole wheat spaghetti noodles, I was able to satisfy my raging pasta cravings with less than half the calories.
Not to mention, it’s quite a beautiful dish.

Ribboning vegetables is simple: Just rinse the veggies and peel away any rough parts of the skin with a vegetable peeler, and then continue to ribbon out the vegetable until it’s practically gone. And if you’re looking for an easy way to spice up your go-to marinara, simply add in some sun dried tomato sauce or spread to give it a sophisticated twist without much effort.

","Cook the noodles according to package instructions, shooting for al dente.Rinse and peel any rough skin spots from the carrot and zucchini. Then continue using the peeler to ‘ribbon’ them into noodles.Combine and warm your tomato sauce and sun dried tomato spread in a medium saucepan over low-medium heat, stirring to combine and adding a little water if too thick.Once noodles are done, scoop them into a strainer (reserving the water) and cover with towel to keep them moist.Place zucchini and carrot noodles in the pasta water and boil for 3-4 minutes until tender or ‘al dente.’Add pasta noodles and vegetable noodles into the sauce, toss lightly and serve immediately.Garnish with vegan parmesan cheese and basil for additional flavor."
926,Blueberry Maple Protein Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Blueberry Maple Protein Shake

For a while now I’ve been seeing the blueberry maple flavor combination pop up, and every time I do I start to salivate immediately. Cakes, syrups, pancakes – it makes sense. The two just seem to be meant together much like peanut butter and basil (trust me, I know what I’m doing.)



But being the simplicity-obsessed person than I am, I knew I wanted to make a blueberry-maple recipe that was a bit less involved. Call it lazy, I call it uncomplicated. And since I have a protein shake most mornings on my walk to work, I thought it the perfect opportunity to put a creative spin on one of my favorite breakfasts.

Blueberry and maple are a perfect summer flavor combination, and when thrown into an ice-creamy health drink, the pairing tastes all the better. You can make this recipe vegan-friendly by opting for a non-dairy milk or yogurt base and protein powder. You can also throw in a big handful of spinach without it affecting the taste at all, which makes it even more of a well-balanced meal.

","Place all of your ingredients in a blender and mix until well combined. If it appears too runny, add more ice. If it's too thick, add more water. Add more sweetener or extract at the end if the flavor isn't strong enough for your taste."
927,Basil and Peanut Butter Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter and Basil Sandwich

The other week, I made spring rolls for dinner. Nothing fancy – just rice paper rolled around rice noodles, carrot and cucumber sticks, and some peanut sauce for dipping. Oh, and basil. This was key.


If there’s one thing you should know about my husband and me, it’s that we have different tastes. I, for instance, can pick up a handful of basil and eat it raw – joyfully. My husband, on the other hand, gets skeptical if there’s any more than 2 sprigs in one dish. Men and women, so different sometimes.

And so, while eating his spring rolls stuffed plentifully with fresh basil, he began to pick all of the leaves out and set them on his plate. And in a moment of fury and confusion, I asked, “Are you gonna eat that?” To which he replied, “No, it’s just too much.” And so I did what any logical foodie would do. I swiped them up in one hand, dipped them in my peanut sauce, and devoured them in one intense and purely satisfying bite. And in that moment, I knew peanut butter and basil would do great things together.

","Toast the baguette or bread lightly (optional) and then layer it with peanut butter, basil, and a drizzle of honey (optional). Devour immediately. Best when fresh."
928,Walnut and Honey Spiced Protein Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Honey and Walnut Spiced Protein Shake

First off, let me tell you, if you haven’t had a protein shake that tastes like a straight-up milkshake, then you haven’t lived. And this recipe may just be your gateway drug into the land of pumped-up protein shake bliss.


A couple of years ago, while my husband and I were living in Portland, OR, our friends had us over for dinner and topped off the meal with walnut, honey, cardamom, and coriander milkshakes. And while I was skeptical at first, the flavor combination was so rich and adventurous I haven’t been able to shake it from my mind since.

I intended to make this into an actual ice cream shake but didn’t have the heart.
One, because it’s just not the healthiest recipe I could share. And two, I don’t have ice cream around the house nearly as often as I intend to as I lack what some people call self control. Envision me, a sad minimalist baker hovering over a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s taking man-sized bites straight from the container, moaning “Ohsogood,” at every taste.
May sound gratifying, but it’s really just sad.

So instead? I present you with a Walnut and Honey Spiced Protein Shake, because protein shakes are healthier for you than ice cream and give you a perfectly good excuse to have a ‘milkshake’ for breakfast. If this idea doesn’t titillate your lady tastes, I don’t know what will.

","Blend all ingredients together until smooth. Add more ice to make thicker, and more water to thin out.Pour into a glass drizzled with honey and garnish with more walnuts (optional)."

Hello, world. That’s what WordPress recommends I say here for my first post. Personally, I disagree. I’d rather go with something more friendly like, “Hey, thanks for stopping by.” Because what says “hello” and “thanks for stopping by my blog” more clearly than that?
But really, thanks for stopping by. And welcome to Minimalist Baker.


This site has been my brainchild for just a little while now, but it’s really been in the making for long time because I’ve always loved minimalist baking. I just never called it that.
One day a few months ago, I started to envision a place where I could share only my favorite recipes that gushed simple. This is because I find something very intriguing about recipes that require very few ingredients, very little time, and only minimal equipment, which is why all of the recipes I plan to post on this site will fall into at least one of these three categories. All the while, keeping health and taste a top priority.
In short, this site embodies everything I adore about food – its simplicity, its beauty, its delicious taste, and its joy-giving nature.

If there’s one thing you should know about me right up front, it’s that I love pancakes, always have. My mom used to coax me out of bed with them in the mornings. Otherwise, I swear I’d still be sleeping through sixth grade. And since then, I’ve put my own spin on my pancakes, making them as simple, healthy, and flavorful as possible. This recipe is no exception to that.

I’ve called these chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes for a very plain reason: That’s exactly what they taste like. Only they contain no butter and no added sugar besides chocolate chips, and they can be made both gluten-free and vegan. They also contain almond butter for a healthy punch of protein for staying power throughout the morning.

","Preheat a skillet to medium heat or about 300-325 degrees F (148-162 C).Prepare flax egg by mixing flaxseed meal and water and letting set for 3-5 minutes.Mash your very ripe banana with baking powder.Add flax egg, oil, salt, vanilla, almond butter, and almond milk and stir.Stir in oats and flour until just combined. Don't over-mix. Add chocolate chips and fold gently.Scoop scant 1/4 cup measurements onto lightly greased griddle. Cook for 2-4 minutes on each side - until golden brown.Serve plain or with a small drizzle of maple syrup and a few additional chocolate chips for melting. Store cooled."
