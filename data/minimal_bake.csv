0,Fluffy Vegan Scrambled Eggs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Vegan Scrambled Eggs   If you’ve ever wanted to make a vegan version of scrambled eggs but craved something a little more special than tofu, this is the recipe for you. Perhaps you’re looking for a more “eggy” texture and flavor than tofu, want to cut back on eggs, are sensitive to soy/tofu, or just want to change up your breakfast routine. In any case, let me show you how easy it is to make these fluffy, vegan scrambled eggs!  This recipe is inspired by the Just Egg product everyone’s been talking about. I was so excited to see an egg product that looked (and supposedly tasted) like the real thing! The only thing I didn’t love was the addition of canola oil, which some health experts believe to be highly processed and inflammatory in the body. So, I wanted to take a swing at my own version and am pretty excited about the results.   The base of this 9-ingredient recipe is soaked split mung beans, a.k.a. moong dal. It’s a soft legume that’s easy to digest and happens to be the color of scrambled eggs (for the win). Once soaked, it’s blended with light coconut milk for added fat (which I discovered helped things like my Buckwheat Crepes bind well without sticking to the pan). For color and flavor I added turmeric, nutritional yeast, onion powder, and black salt, a.k.a. kala namak. It’s a special seasoning that has a magical eggy flavor. It’s crazy how much it really does taste like eggs! If you don’t have black salt either order it or just use whatever salt you have on hand. It’s not absolutely essential. Rice flour helps thicken and give body and texture to the “eggs.” And oil adds a little bit more fat for pliability. Once blended it’s time to cook!  I found the best method for cooking these “eggs” is in a non-stick pan (we like this one as a healthier alternative to Teflon). But you can use a well-oiled cast iron in a pinch. Heat over medium-low, add just enough of the mixture to coat the pan, then cover and cook for a couple minutes. The edges should appear dry, which means it’s time to push them around with a soft spatula. Cover and cook for 1-2 minutes more for a soft scramble or up to 4-5 minutes (flipping occasionally) for a firm scramble.  We hope you LOVE these vegan scrambled eggs! They’re: Fluffy Eggy Satisfying Easy to make Versatile &amp; Incredibly delicious These would make the perfect thing to have on hand for easy scrambles throughout the week. Or, use as a base for things like quiche, frittatas, omelets, and more! Oh the eggy possibilities.

0,Vegan Buttercream Frosting Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Vegan Buttercream Frosting  If you’ve ever wondered how to make vegan buttercream frosting, you’re in the right place! This step-by-step tutorial will demonstrate how easy it is to make perfect vegan buttercream frosting every time! Plus, we share our favorite vegan butter brands, tips for success, and recipes to put it to good use!  Vegan Buttercream Frosting vs. Buttercream Frosting The two main differences between traditional and vegan buttercream frosting are:  The dairy butter is replaced with vegan butter and the whipping cream or milk is replaced with non-dairy milk. Organic powdered sugar is used in place of traditional powdered sugar as some sugars can be considered not vegan due to the way they’re processed using animal products. See this article for more information. In general, stick to organic brands for higher quality, ethically-sourced sugar.   As for preparation, the basic rules still apply:  Use softened vegan butter, which blends better (and don’t microwave chilled butter to speed softening time – it will make your buttercream runny) Use quality powdered sugar and sift it before adding to the butter or it can form clumps If your buttercream gets too thick, simply thin with a little dairy-free milk of choice (ours being creamy coconut)  How to use it? On cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and more, including:  Apple Gingerbread Cake Gluten-Free Vegan Carrot Cake Vegan Sugar Cookies Gluten-Free Vegan Vanilla Cake Gluten-Free Vegan Pumpkin Cake Vegan Funfetti Cupcakes French Toast Sugar Cookies Vegan Pumpkin Sugar Cookies Vegan Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies Vegan Gluten-Free Cinnamon Rolls   That’s it!

0,Easy 1-Pot Vegan Tom Yum Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lazy 1-Pot Vegan Tom Yum Soup   A while back it was just one of those nights when I didn’t feel like leaving the house but wasn’t sure what to make for dinner. Soup sounded comforting, so I dug through my cabinets to see what I had. Luckily, I almost always have things like curry paste, vegetable broth, and coconut milk on hand. So I did some recipe research and got inspired. I’m sure you see where this is going. Let me show you how to make Vegan Tom Yum Soup in 1 pot with ingredients you likely have on hand right now.  This recipe is inspired by the lovely folks at Evergreen Kitchen. I was swooning over the recipe but didn’t have a number of the ingredients, so I started making swaps and it turned out lovely. In place of traditional ingredients like kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal, fresh tomato, Thai chilies, and tamari I subbed lime peel, green curry paste, ginger, canned tomatoes, serrano pepper, and coconut aminos. Chances are most of you don’t have the more traditional items on hand either. So I thought I’d share my “lazy girl” version in the event you want soup but don’t want to make a trip to the grocery store.  It starts with onion, serrano, ginger, and garlic. I also threw in some lemongrass this round, but if you don’t have it, rest assured it’s likely in your green curry paste (which you’ll add to the soup anyway)! Next comes vegetable broth, coconut milk, coconut aminos, and coconut sugar. Lime juice gets added last for that classic sour flavor Tom Yum provides. The result is a quick, creamy, hot and sour soup with a little sweetness that’s comfort food in the truest sense.  For more staying power, you’ve got options: Serve over cooked quinoa or brown rice noodles. Top with our Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu. Throw some plain tofu into the pot while cooking.   We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s: Spicy-sour Subtly sweet Rich Comforting Versatile &amp; Incredibly delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal or side when you need something on the table fast. We enjoyed ours with Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu, zucchini noodles, and some of these Kelp Noodles! Into soup?

0,1-Bowl Chocolate Banana Baked Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Chocolate Chip Banana Baked Oatmeal   You all enjoyed my Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal so much I immediately knew I wanted to create another flavor variation, which happens to be my favorite combo of all time: Nut butter, banana, chocolate! It’s so easy and comes together in 1 bowl with 10 ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Let’s bake!  This baked oatmeal starts with a flax egg and mashed ripe banana. It’s then naturally sweetened with a little maple syrup, seasoned with cinnamon, and moistened with dairy-free milk and a little oil (which can be omitted or subbed with applesauce if needed).  Next comes oats, nuts, and dark chocolate! We also recommend adding a little nut butter on top for garnish to give each serving even more richness. Plus, bananas and nut butter just belong together.  After an optional sprinkle of coconut sugar for a brûlée effect, it’s into the oven for a 30 minute bake. And just like that, breakfast is on the table!  We hope you all LOVE this baked oatmeal! It’s: Hearty Comforting Nutty Reminiscent of banana bread Naturally sweetened &amp; SO delicious This would make a delicious lazy weekend brunch to enjoy with friends or family. It would also be a satisfying breakfast to bake ahead of time and warm up in the mornings before work!

But you can never have too much lasagna…am I right?! Lasagna is the ULTIMATE comfort food!   This simple 10-ingredient lasagna is our plant-based take on classic lasagna. And dare I say, it’s AMAZING! It all starts with sautéing protein-rich tempeh or mushrooms — your choice!   Next come coconut aminos and spices to give the sauce extra flavor. Add in homemade or store-bought marinara and you’ve got yourself some seriously good lasagna sauce.  Then it’s time for the cheese layer — made with macadamia nuts and ready in just 5 minutes with a little help from the food processor.  Once you’ve got your sauce, cheese, and noodles, it’s time to start layering. Can we start a little jingle? Sauce, Noodles, Cheese.

0,Potato Cauliflower Red Lentil Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Potato Cauliflower Red Lentil Curry   I’ve been counting down the days to share this curry with you all! It’s incredibly hearty, versatile, and is ready in just 30 minutes. Shall we?  This recipe came together on a whim one night when using up odds and ends from the week. I was hungry and needed something fast for dinner (hence the 30 minutes). The first step is rinsing and cooking your red lentils, which I recommend doing in a separate pan. Red lentils cook really quickly (less than 10 minutes in my experience), and benefit from cooking separately versus in the pot with the rest of the curry. While that’s happening, you’ll warm some whole spices like cumin, coriander, and mustard seed in a little coconut or avocado oil before adding shallot, ginger, garlic, and serrano pepper! For vegetables I went with cauliflower, potato, and bell pepper because that’s what I had on hand. But you can certainly sub similar vegetables according to what’s in season!  To make a saucy curry, I recommend blitzing a can of diced tomatoes (or grating a few whole tomatoes) into a loose sauce. This adds depth of flavor to the dish and makes it a little lighter than a curry that gets all its moisture from coconut milk. Next comes a little vegetable broth for richness, coconut aminos for depth of flavor and umami, maple syrup for a touch of sweetness, and a little coconut milk to ensure a creamy texture. ﻿  Friends, I’ve been digging this curry so hard ever since we created it. We hope you love it, too! It’s: Comforting Quick Hearty Wholesome Versatile &amp; Flavor-packed This would make the perfect meal when you need something hearty and delicious on the table fast! The vegetables can be swapped out for whatever you have on hand. And you can play around with the tomato:coconut ratio for varied texture. Add more tomatoes or broth for a lighter curry or more coconut milk for a creamier, richer curry! Into curries? We have so many! Try our 1-Pot Golden Curry Lentil Soup, 1-Pot Yellow Chickpea Cauliflower Curry, Rich Red Curry with Roasted Vegetables, 1-Pot Pumpkin Yellow Curry, or Sweet Potato Cauliflower Curry!

0,1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Banana Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Banana Bread   I can’t shake the fact that banana bread is still my favorite baked good (probably of all time), even after all these years. Nothing quite beats a thick slice of banana bread with a little nut butter and a cup of tea or coffee. Since creating our 1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread several years ago, I’ve wanted to perfect an egg-free version. You guys seem to LOVE that recipe, and dare I say this vegan version is even better? I know — bold claim. But so true. Let me show you how it’s done!  This 1 bowl recipe starts with a flax egg and mashed ripe banana — 3 ripe bananas to be exact. Then it’s naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar, moistened with a small amount of avocado or coconut oil, and gets a boost of healthy fats and protein from almond butter!   For the dry ingredients I stuck with our tried and true Gluten-Free Flour Blend, almond meal, and rolled oats. This combo just seems to work in quick breads. Walnuts add a nice crunch (and a healthy dose of omega-3 fatty acids). Plus, they take the aesthetic up a notch.  After about 1 hour in the oven, your house will smell like heaven in a loaf pan. Behold: The Vegan Gluten-Free Banana Bread of my dreams.  We hope you LOVE this bread. It’s: Tender on the inside Golden brown on the outside Naturally sweet Incredibly hearty Satisfying &amp; So, so delicious This would make the perfect breakfast on the go, hearty snack, or healthier treat.

0,How to Make Pour-Over Coffee | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Pour-Over Coffee   When making pour-over coffee, the two biggest factors are:  Coffee bean quality Purity of water  However, every detail matters. Getting a consistent grind coarseness, using proper measurements, and having the right temperature water will also improve how your cup of joe tastes.  What you’ll need:  Quality, fresh coffee beans (we gravitate toward beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia) Chemex coffeemaker Filtered water (we love this Berkey Water filter) Water kettle (something with a gooseneckspout is best for pouring) Paper filters Coffee grinder(the better the grind, the better the coffee. However, quality beans and filtered water trump grind, so just get what you can!) Scale(ensures accuracy)   Now, on to preparation. If you dig around enough, you’ll find varying recommendations on the ratio of coffee to water. I’ve worked this recipe for a number of years and end up using 1g of coffee to 16ml of water. So for a pot of coffee that yields about 2 big cups (250ml each), you’d use 32g of coffee + ~500ml water.  This assumes you’re using a high-quality coffee bean and filtered water. Sometimes coffee is made unnecessarily strong to hide bean or water imperfections. I also tend to grind my coffee just a smidge finer (to the consistency of table salt) than what’s usually recommended (rough sea salt), which seems to balance well with a little bit more water to make a beautiful cup of coffee. That said, don’t be fooled. This is going to be a bold cup of coffee! I make adjustments when using a different bean or system, but this process has held up well for me for years (and we drink coffee pretty much every day).  We hope you LOVE this coffee brewing method. It’s: Tried and tested Easy to master Consistent &amp; Delicious every time Enjoy your perfect cup of coffee as is, or use as a base in beverages like our Mushroom Latte 2 Ways! It can also be used in recipes like our Coconut Coffee Ice Cream, Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino (just cool your coffee first), Vegan Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches, and 3-Ingredient Vegan Mocha Milkshake.

0,Vegan Palak Paneer with Curried Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Palak Paneer with Curried Tofu   For years I’ve been wanting to make a plant-based take on palak paneer. The vibrant green color lures me in every time. Thankfully, this recipe is not only simple to make, but also incredibly delicious and requires just 30 minutes! Let me show you how it’s done.  This recipe starts with prepping your tofu in curry powder, coconut aminos, and nutritional yeast to mock the paneer or cheese in the classic take on the dish.  Next you’ll sauté onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano pepper with cumin seed. Once browned, you’ll add diced tomatoes and cook until tender.   While that’s happening, you’ll blanch some spinach and add to a blender with your sautéed vegetables. This creates a creamy base for the palak paneer, which will blend beautifully with your cheesy, crispy tofu!  All that’s left to do is heat the mixture briefly on the stovetop with some coconut milk and more spices and you’re good to go! Such a hearty and delicious 30-minute meal!  We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s: Quick &amp; easy Packed with greens Flavorful Satisfying &amp; Incredibly deliciouspr This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you need something nourishing and delicious on the table fast!

0,1-Pan Tempeh Vegan Bolognese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pan Tempeh Bolognese   This hearty, 1-pan tempeh bolognese is a plant-based take on a classic that pairs perfectly with pastas, eggplant parmesan, lasagna, and more! Plus, it comes together in just 30 minutes. Let me show you how it’s done.  This bolognese starts with sautéed onion, mushrooms, and garlic for a flavorful base. Then comes finely grated tempeh, which cooks in the pan until seared. It’s important to use a pan large enough that the tempeh has room to sauté. Add a bit more oil as needed to deglaze the pan and ensure the tempeh is browning up nicely! Next comes fennel, red pepper flake, coconut aminos, and dry red wine to infuse plenty of flavor into the tempeh. After a little more sautéing, you’ll add your crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, vegan parmesan cheese, a dash of sweetener, and a little water to ensure the right consistency. That’s it! It just needs to simmer to deepen in flavor, but it’s essentially ready to go!   We hope you LOVE this bolognese! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Versatile Quick &amp; easy to make Protein-rich (16 g / serving!) &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect sauce for simple cooked pasta dishes, or to pair withCrispy Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesanor layer in one of our Vegan Lasagnas!

0,Warming Winter Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Warming Winter Smoothie   Do you ever miss smoothies in the wintertime? I do. I love the nutrition smoothies provide, but often find they’re too cooling and can even slow my digestion down when colder weather arrives. After doing some research on the ancient practice of Ayurveda, I discovered there are a few ways to “warm” your smoothie so it’s not so cooling to your body, which is perfect when you’re already battling colder temps but still want your daily dose of greens. Let me show you how.  This smoothie is easy to make, requiring just 1 blender,10minutes, and 10 ingredients. It starts with ripe banana, carrot, and zucchini (or cauliflower). I’ve been loving using less banana and subbing in some carrot for more natural sweetness and fiber lately. Plus, when adding in protein powder, I generally find excess banana can make it too sweet.   Next comes protein powder, hemp seeds for a dose of essential fatty acids, and warming spices like ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and black pepper.In place of these spices you can also sub my Golden Milk Mix, making this smoothie another creative use for this go-to blend (also used in my Golden Milk Snack Bites!). To make a smoothie more warming, try:  Using cold or room temperature ingredients instead of frozen Adding warming spices like cinnamon, black pepper, turmeric, clove, cayenne, and ginger (which help stimulate digestion) Going for dairy-free milks like cashew or macadamia vs. coconut milk, which can be more cooling in the body Adding roasted winter squash, like butternut squash or roasted sweet potato in place of frozen banana Drinking in the afternoon when your digestive fire is strongest, as opposed to in the morning when your digestive fire is low  These little switches can make a huge difference in keeping your body warm yet still nourished this winter and spring! Of course, I’m not an Ayurvedic physician or nutrition expert. But these changes have helped me continue to enjoy smoothies in the wintertime! (Find a list of cooling and warming foods here!)  We hope you LOVE this smoothie! It’s: Creamy Not too sweet Fiber-rich Well balanced Warming &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect light breakfast, workout recovery drink, or afternoon snack to help you make it to dinner.

0,My Go-To Guacamole Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Go-To Guacamole   Over the years I’ve made dozens of batches of guacamole at home, each one a little different and more nuanced than the last. I’ve tried varying quantities of ingredients, using limes vs. lemons, playing with different spices and textures, and I’m happy to report I’ve perfected my perfect go-to guacamole! Let me show you how easy it is with just 1 bowl, 10 minutes, and 8 ingredients required!  This guacamole is so quick and easy to make and it all starts with ripe avocados. How to pick ripe avocados If you’re unsure how to pick ripe, healthy avocados, I like to go for ones that are closer to black than green, are tender but not mushy, and don’t appear to have any blemishes or mealy spots. If you’re unsure if the avocado is past its prime, you can remove the little stem at the top of the avocado. If it has a green color to it, it’s still fresh! On the other hand, if it’s gone brown, it’s probably past its prime. How to store avocados If you’ve picked avocados that are ripe and ready to use, either use within 1-2 days or throw in the refrigerator where they’ll keep fresh for 5-7 days. The refrigerator seems to slow the ripening process. If you’ve picked firm or unripe avocados, let them ripen on your counter at room temperature until no longer firm to the touch (I like setting mine in a produce bowl near other things that are ripening— especially bananas — as they seem to help each other along). Ripe avocados should have some give, but do not feel mushy when squeezed.  Add your ripe avocados to a mixing or serving bowl along with onion, jalapeño, cumin, salt, red pepper flake, and lime juice and mash to your desired consistency. If you like a little chunkiness, take it easy and just aim to incorporate the flavors. If you prefer your guacamole on the creamier side, a potato masher can be helpful, or just use a fork and mash until smooth.   At this point you can add in your cilantro (it’s more delicate so it’s better not to over-mix it), along with any additional seasonings to taste. And that’s it! Perfect guacamole every time.  We hope you LOVE this guacamole! It’s: Citrusy Perfectly spiced Creamy Quick &amp; easy to make Customizable &amp; Perfect for SO many dishes! This guacamole is ideal for dipping with your favorite tortilla chips or veggies. Pair with our favorite Ginger Beer Margaritas for the ultimate happy hour treat!

0,Easy Harissa Paste Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy DIY Harissa Paste   Have you ever seen a recipe that called for “harissa paste,”but weren’t sure what it was? I’ve been there. In my earlier days of cooking I used to either skip it altogether, or substitute with whatever hot sauce I had on hand. Fast forward to now, and I use harissa paste— a North African spicy red sauce— all the time. It consists of simple ingredients like red chilies, garlic, vinegar, and spices, and is perfect for adding smokiness and heat to dishes like hummus, lentil chili, pasta sauce, and more. I typically buy harissa at the store, but recently have wanted to make my own so I could control the spice level— some can be quite hot, which throttles how much you can add to your meal. Let me show you how easy it is to make fresh harissa paste (and adjust the heat to your liking) at home in just 30 minutes!  The ingredients for harissa paste are pretty simple. The two you may not have on hand are dried chilies— which most grocery stores carry, and are easy to find online (links below)— and caraway seeds, which add a mild licorice flavor. Caraway seeds are a common ingredient in harissa paste, but if you don’t have them, fret not— simply leave them out or compensate with more of the other spices. First, rehydrate your chilies in hot water, then remove the stems and seeds. While that’s happening, toast your whole cumin and coriander seeds and grind in a mortar and pestle. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, simply add to a food processor to blend later.    Next you’ll add smoked paprika, salt, and garlic, and mix again, before adding lemon juice and vinegar and mixing into a paste.  Once all of your ingredients are added to the food processor, blend into a smooth paste. Add olive oil near the end to create a creamy, smooth sauce. If avoiding oil, either omit or sub water for a similar effect.  We hope you LOVE this sauce! It’s: Smoky Spicy Customizable Versatile &amp; Incredibly delicious Harissa can be added to dishes like my Moroccan-Spiced Eggplant &amp; Tomato Stew, Saucy Moroccan-Spiced Lentils, and Smoky Harissa Eggplant Dip. But it’s great for adding depth of flavor, nuance, and smoky spice to just about any dish, including hummus, salad dressings, pasta sauce, soups, and more!

Until recently, I never would’ve dreamed of putting mushrooms anywhere near my coffee or hot chocolate, but now I’m putting them in my morning lattes, smoothies, evening hot chocolate, and beyond! Let me show you how easy it is to make 2 delicious mushroom “lattes” at home in just 5 minutes.  My fascination with mushroom powders began after listening to this Rich Roll podcast episode with Tero Isokauppila,the founder of Four Sigmatic— a company that’s seeking to educate people on the benefits of medicinal mushrooms and make them accessible to consumers. I had no idea mushrooms could be so good for you. From the simple act of eating sautéed mushroomsto adding lion’s mane mushroom to your morning coffee, the health benefits are kind of amazing. I’m certainly no expert, but from what I’ve gathered the best and most accessible mushroom to eat is shiitake (be sure to eat them cooked in a little fat to increase bioavailability). As far as mushroom powders go, I recommend reaching for chaga (for antioxidants, overall wellness, and immunity), reishi (for calm, relaxation, and sleep), lion’s mane (for brain function and focus), and cordyceps (for performance, adaptogenic effects, and increased oxygen flow).   So why mushrooms in coffee? Adding things like mushroom powders to coffee can offset some of the downsides of coffee, including jitters, acidity, and disrupted digestion. When adding mushrooms to things like hot chocolate, you’re simply reaping the benefits of the various kinds of mushrooms on top of the antioxidants in cacao. And the cool thing is you really can’t taste the mushrooms! Their earthiness pairs nicely with both coffee and chocolate flavors. It’s kind of a win-win. Now, that’s not to say drinking super-sugary lattes or pots of coffee in the morning with a side of mushroom powder makes the health downsides go away. But, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that adding more mushrooms to our diet can be beneficial. With that said, I’ve been playing around with two mushroom blends from Four Sigmatic (not sponsored— just love their stuff!) and have really enjoyed them so far. I can’t say I’ve noticed dramatic effects, but I like knowing that if I am going to have caffeine, the effects won’t be quite as harsh. And if I’m having hot chocolate anyway, might as well enjoy some health benefits while I’m at it.  I hope you LOVE these two mushroom drinks! They’re: Creamy Perfectly sweet Comforting Customizable &amp; Seriously delicious These lattes would make the perfect morning pick-me-up with health perks (especially the coffee version) or evening wind down or afternoon treat (especially the hot chocolate).

0,30-Minute Tempeh Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Tempeh Stir-Fry   Everyone needs a good, classic stir fry recipe in their back pocket for quick lunches and dinners, and I think this should be the one. It comes together in just 30 minutes, uses up leftover grains and vegetables from the week, is rich in protein and fiber, and delivers big flavor. What’s not to love? Let me show you how easy it is to get this dish on the table.  It all starts with marinating the tempeh. Cube your tempeh, mix with your peanut-coconut aminos (or tamari) glaze, and set aside. While that’s happening you’ll prep your other ingredients.   Once marinated, sauté your tempeh on both sides until golden brown and delicious. Then you’ll add your veggies and grains and stir-fry until crispy and browned before adding your tempeh back to the pan to warm. That’s it!   We hope you LOVE this stir fry! It’s: Quick &amp; easy to make Incredibly flavorful Vegetable-packed Protein- &amp; fiber-rich &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something hearty and nutritious on the table fast. I also love making it for lunch when I want something fast and filling.

0,Simple Green Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Green Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette   Every cook should know how to make a simple side salad and lemon vinaigrette. It’s the easy side dish to pair with just about any entrée, comes together in 10 minutes with simple ingredients, and is incredibly versatile. Let me show you how it’s done.  Start with a base of greens. We went with spring greens, but I also love spinach as a base, as well as thinly sliced kale, arugula, and romaine.  Next comes any vegetable you have on hand. My go-to’s are finely shredded carrot, chopped tomatoes, and onion or shallot. But to make it a little more fancy, I also included pomegranate arils, cranberries, and pepitas. For even more texture and flavor, you could also consider adding things like my Easy Vegan Parmesan Cheese, Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas or 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese!  Next comes the dressing. Recipes usually recommend adding twice the amount of oil as acid when making vinaigrette. But I find that makes the dressing taste too oily. So I go for more of a 1:1 ratio for better balance, add a little maple syrup to offset the acidity, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. For even more flavor and texture, you can whisk (or blend) in some shallot. Blending it will add more body to your dressing (making it creamier and thicker). Whisking will be more visually appealing as you can see specks of shallot throughout the dressing.  We hope you love and use this side salad all the time. It’s: Simple Light Quick &amp; Easy to make Fresh &amp; Customizable You can pair this side salad with just about any dish. It’s especially delicious with our Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger, Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac ‘n’ Cheese, Easy Gluten-Free Vegan Pizza, andGarlic &amp; White Wine Pasta with Brussels Sprouts.

0,1-Pot Cauliflower Dal Green Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Cauliflower Dal Green Curry   When winter comes and the nights get cold, I crave comfort food…but I still want my greens. That’s literally where inspiration for this dish came from: “How do I eat so many cooked greens?” I love this dish because it’s both Indian- and Thai-inspired, using both split mung beans (or moong dal), and my go-to Thai-inspired green curry paste. Let me show you how it’s done!   This 1-pot meal starts with soaked moong dal (a.k.a. split mung beans). While that’s happening, you can prep your fresh green curry paste (or opt for store-bought!) and veggies.  First we start with sautéed shallot, ginger, and garlic before adding the green curry paste, which adds the primary flavor to this dish. Next comes chopped cauliflower, coconut milk, coconut aminos for depth of flavor, maple syrup for sweetness, and a little lime for acidity. The soaked moong dal is added and once tender, we throw in a generous amount of greens (I went for kale) and cover to wilt. Then, it’s serving time! It’s that easy.  We hope you LOVE this dish. It’s: Comforting Flavorful Vegetable-packed Easy to make &amp; Incredibly satisfying This would make the perfect hearty meal when you want something nourishing and delicious. It’s tasty as is, or (our preference) served over grains (like rice or quinoa) and garnished with fresh lime and cilantro.

0,5-Ingredient Golden Milk Snack Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Golden Milk Snack Bites   For a while now, I’ve been wanting to recreate the comforting flavors of golden milk in a portable snack. I theorized a bar might work, but then remembered how very delicious my no-bake cake bites were and I couldn’t get my mind off of golden milk snack bites. These 5-ingredientballs are packed with warming, anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric and ginger, naturally sweetened with maple syrup,grain- and gluten-free, and come together in about 20 minutes. Oh, and don’t forget the optional coconut butter swirl and “frosting.” Swoon! Let me show you how it’s done!  These snack bites start with creamy cashew butter, which I consider one of the more neutral and creamy nut butters, making it an ideal base for this recipe. Need to avoid nuts? Check the ingredients section below for substitution ideas. Next comes a heaping spoonful of my Golden Milk Mixfor that warming golden milk flavor, and a sprinkle of hemp seeds for added protein and essential fatty acids. Maple syrup adds a bit of natural sweetness, and coconut flour creates a moldable dough with a little added sweetness and coconut flavor.  Next you can add a dollop of coconut butter for a coconut swirl (optional) and then roll into balls. Enjoy straight from the pan, or refrigerate to chill.  I opted to “frost” these with melted coconut butter. But you could leave them plain or roll them in shredded coconut as well!   We hope you LOVE these bites! They’re: Tender Naturally sweet Portable Perfectly spiced Quick &amp; easy to make &amp; Sort of amazing These would make the perfect on-the-go snack or healthier treat. I’ve been enjoying one with a cup of hot tea in the afternoon—it’s the perfect pick-me-up. While coconut butter is a delicious “frosting,” I could also see a drizzle of melted dark chocolate making these even more indulgent if you want to serve them as dessert.

0,Lemon Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shots | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lemon Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shots   When considering what type of beverage to share for New Year’s Eve celebrations this year, my mind initially went to mocktails. They’re fruity and booze-free—what’s not to love? Well, if I’m honest, I’m not a huge mocktail fan. Then I thought, “What would be something I’d actually be excited to drink if walking into a NYE party?” Answer:Healthy shots. Call me a grandma, I don’t care. That’s how I roll these days.

0,Skillet Sweet Potato Hash Browns | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"2-Ingredient Sweet Potato Hash Browns   When testing our Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, I experimented with the best way to turn sweet potatoes into pasta. One such experiment led me to discover that frying them in a skillet makes the perfect hash brown-style sweet potatoes, while steaming yields the best pasta “noodle” texture. The rest is history. Let me show you this quick and easy method for making perfect sweet potato hash browns every time!  This 2-ingredient, 1-pan, 15-minute recipe starts with preparing your sweet potatoes. Our preferred method is spiralizing them. But if you don’t own a spiralizer, you can simply grate using a box grater, or use the grater attachment on your food processor to achieve a similar effect.  Once spiralized or grated, simply heat a skillet until hot, add a little oil and your sweet potatoes and seasonings of choice, and pan fry to perfection. The trick to perfect sweet potato hash brownsis making sure your pan is hot enough to brown the sweet potatoes, while also covering with a lid to create steam so the hash browns get tender on the insides.   We hope you LOVE these sweet potatoes! They’re: Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Salty-sweet So easy to make &amp; Incredibly delicious These would make the perfect side for your breakfast spread.

0,1-Pot Butternut Squash Quinoa Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Butternut Squash Quinoa Chili   Cut through those bitter winter nights with this comforting 1-pot meal that’s easy to make, big on flavor, and made with ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Let’s do this!  This 1-pot recipe starts with the basics: Onion, garlic, pepper. We went for jalapeño for added heat. But if you’re looking to avoid spice, opt for a bell pepper instead! Next comes the star of the show: Butternut squash!   The flavor comes in waves from spices like chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and a little coconut sugar to balance the heat. And if you’re looking for more depth of flavor and spice, throw in a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce! It’s our “secret sauce” for adding smoky heat to dishes like chili and tortilla soup. In place of water, I opted for vegetable broth to add even more flavor. Every time I add an ingredient to the pot I think, “What flavor is this adding?” If it doesn’t add any flavor, quite frankly, we don’t have time for that. So, vegetable broth it is!  I threw some quinoa in the mix because I happen to love quinoa, and I appreciate that it adds a little more plant protein to the mix. What’s not to adore?  In the last few minutes of cooking, I threw in some kale, because, nutrients. And that color! Total swoon. And just like that, dinner’s on the table.  We hope you LOVE this chili!

0,Easy Pan Roasted Vegetables | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Pan Roasted Vegetables   What’s an easy, elegant side dish? Pan roasted vegetables is the answer. Roasted vegetables are perfect for just about any meal, holiday or otherwise. But they feel especially cozy and celebratory when paired with things like our Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf” and Easy Vegan Gravy. Perfect dinner much? Plus, this tutorial shows you:  How to get perfectly tender roasted vegetables every time, Which seasonings make the flavors pop, and What sauces pair best with different flavor profiles and styles of dishes.  Shall we?  This recipe requires 1 pan, as the title suggests. I love recipes where you can just throw everything on a pan with the seasonings, toss, and bake! It’swhy I started Minimalist Baker to begin with. Ease, simplicity, no fuss—that’s the name of the game around here. For this particular batch of veggies, I went with onion, potato, sweet potato, parsnip, beets, and carrots. But really you can throw just about any vegetables you have on hand onto the pan. Just keep in mind baking times. Baking Times Starchier root vegetables and onions generally take a bit longer to cook through—generally speaking, about 25-35 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C), while lighter vegetables, such as bell peppers, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli require less—generally speaking, about 20-25 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 C). The one exception here is cauliflower, which I find benefits from a longer roast (up to 35-40 minutes). So, for example, if mixing broccoli and sweet potato, I’d suggest adding the broccoli to the pan at about the 10-minute mark to prevent it from burning.  Let’s talk flavor. To keep things festive and autumnal, for this recipe, I went with fresh rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper to enhance each vegetable’s flavors, and (the unsung hero) a bit of maple syrup. A little sweetness helps enhance the natural starches in vegetables. I especially love it for sweet potato, onions, and parsnip. But really, it adds a little “oomph” to most roasted vegetables. Salty-sweet just works. Flavor also comes from a light coating of oil, which helps the veggies caramelize, become tender, and brown in the oven, resulting in that “umami” effect. If avoiding oil, fear not. Check out our Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables tutorial! Not into herbs? Go for any spice blend—our DIY Curry Powder and DIY Shawarma Spice Blend are instant favorites!    What about sauce? When it comes to sauce pairings, a)they’re optional. And b) the world is your oyster. For this batch of vegetables, I went with our Easy Vegan Gravybecause I intended to serve it alongside a healthy helping ofMashed Cauliflower and ourVegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf.”Otherwise, here are a few other pairing ideas that make the most of delicious sauces. Vegan Crudité, utilizing our 5-minute Macadamia Nut Cheese Abundance Kale Salad, utilizing our a Savory Tahini Dressing Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowls, utilizing our go-to Lemon Maple Tahini Dressing Roasted Squash Salad, utilizing a Balsamic Reduction Roasted Vegetable Tacos, utilizing our Easy Chimichurri Sauce Curry Roasted Vegetables &amp; Lentil Salad, utilizing a savory Tahini-Curry Dressing Rich Red Curry with Roasted Vegetables, utilizing a Rich Curry Sauce  We hope you love these pan roasted veggies!

0,No-Bake Peanut Butter Thumbprint Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient No-Bake Peanut Butter Thumbprints   Friends! I’m so excited to share my new favorite cookie with you just in time for the holidays. They’re so easy to make, ready in 20 minutes,require no baking and just 5 ingredients, and they’re naturally sweetened! Let’s (not) bake!  The base for thesecookies starts with creamy, salted peanut butter sweetened with maple syrup. For gluten-free flour I used almond flour for its light texture, somewhat “cakey” flavor, and ability to absorb moisture without over-drying (like coconut flour can). While I didn’t test the recipe with other flours, I suspect oat flour, coconut flour (if reduced by half), or your gluten-free blend of choice would likely work.   Once your dough is formed, scoop out golf ball sized amounts and form into balls. Then use your finger or thumb to make an indent. Transfer to the fridge to chill while you make your jam.  To make the jam, all we’re essentially doing is blending up dried fruit and adding a little hot water. I tested several jam options, including both store-bought jam, fresh chia-raspberry jam, and cooked compote. But none of these compared (see why in the notes) to this simple 1-ingredient blended option! It’s tart and sweet, not too wet, and sits perfectly in the thumbprint!  The jam recipe makes enough for about two batches of cookies, so you’ll have leftovers to use for future cookies and baked goods (think banana bread swirl), on top of oats, or stirred into chia pudding. Once the jam is dolloped into the cookies, they’re ready to enjoy or chill back in the refrigerator!  We hope you all LOVE these cookies! They’re: Tender Peanut-buttery Salty-sweet Easy &amp; quick to make &amp; Absolutely delicious These would make the perfect easy cookies to bring to holiday gatherings, cookie swaps, or to just have around the house when you’re craving a healthier treat.

It all happens in the food processor where you’ll blend some shredded unsweetened coconut into a fine meal.    Next comes coconut oil for moisture and to help them brown. Maple syrup adds natural sweetness, vanilla a subtle vanilla flavor, and aquafaba more moisture plus binding power! All that’s left is a little salt to balance the sweetness, and some cornstarch (or arrowroot), which helps add structure and more binding to the cookies. Then, it’s off to the oven.  After a short bake, these little guys are ready to enjoy. Crisp and golden on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. Swoon! You can dig in right away, or let them cool and dunk or drizzle them in dark chocolate! Either way, it’s a total win-win.  We hope you LOVE these cookies!

0,Easy Vegan Lentil Fesenjān | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Lentil Fesenjān (Pomegranate Walnut Stew)   We’ve been big fans of Fesenjān for years now—ever since John’s aunt introduced us to it at a Persian restaurant in San Diego. Traditionally prepared for special occasions, Fesenjān is perfect for colder months. It’s hearty, comforting, savory-sweet, and so simple to make. Let us show you how!  This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 9 ingredients. It starts with toasting walnuts and sautéing onions to create a rich and hearty base for the stew. The walnuts are blended into a fine meal and are almost undetectable in the final dish, but add a nuttiness that I just love.  The flavor comes from plenty of warming spices like cinnamon and turmeric as well as vegetable broth and a somewhat uncommon ingredient—pomegranate molasses. You can find pomegranate molasses at most specialty stores, or—good news—you can make your own (which is what I do). Simply cook down pomegranate juice until thickened and reduced and you’ve got a great homemade substitute.   Though this dish is traditionally cooked with meat, I first began cooking it at home with chickpeas (a recipe you’ll find in our cookbook!). But I must say, lentils and Fesenjān belong together. They become tender in the broth and take on the flavors so incredibly well.I’m hooked!  We hope you LOVE this recipe! It’s: Hearty Savory-sweet Comforting Warming Satisfying Incredibly flavorful Versatile &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect meal for holidays, hosting, weeknight dinners, and beyond.

Plus, the ingredients happen to be some of my favorites this time of year, so it was just meant to be. Let me show you how easy it is!  This dish requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods to prepare. It starts by cooking your quinoa and roasting your squash until golden and tender. The squash gets a flavor boost from salt and a little coconut sugar.  Next, you can prepare your balsamic reduction by simply cooking over low flame for 15 until a syrup forms. And all that’s left is sautéing your cooked quinoa, mushrooms, kale, and walnuts (optional). Once your squash is tender, stuff with your quinoa filling and bake another 5 minutes until hot. That’s it!  For garnish we went with our balsamic reduction and our beloved crispy shallot to add a savory crunch to the top. It’s optional but highly recommended and can be prepared while your squash is roasting!   We hope you love this squash! It’s: Savory-sweet Super hearty Easy to make Customizable &amp; a delicious main or side!

This 6-ingredient, 30-minute recipe is bound to wow your guests this holiday season (and beyond).

Once steamed, transfer cauliflower in batches to a food processor (or use an immersion blender) to blend until smooth. You’ll add more salt and pepper to taste, and a dash of dairy-free milk to get a velvety, creamy texture. Major swoon! We hope you love this dish. It’s: Easy to make Hearty and comforting Simply seasoned Buttery Garlicky &amp; utterly delicious This would make a beautiful side dish for the holidays and beyond! Top with more fresh garlic, vegan butter, and your favorite fresh herbs to really dress it up. You could even blend in a little nutritional yeast to add cheesy flavor, or vegan cream cheese for more creaminess.

0,4-Ingredient Vegan Easy Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Easy Vegan Brownies   For a while now, I’ve been wanting to make a brownie that is so easy that it can be made quickly, with minimal equipment, and with ingredients I always have on hand. I imagined the texture and flavor I wanted and worked backward from there. And friends, I can’t tell you how happy I am with the results! Let’s make ooey-gooey vegan brownies!   The base of this 4-ingredient, 30-minute, 1-bowl recipe is dates, which create the fudgy texture, naturally sweeten the brownies, and bind the batter as well. Next comes nut butter. It’s less important which nut butter you use and more important how fresh and creamy it is. When you use peanut butter made with just peanuts and salt, you get a luxurious, creamy texture and it literally pours out of the jar. This is what you’re going for! If you’re peanut-free, I think almond, cashew, or even sesame butter (tahini) would work well here. After nut butter comes raw cacao powder for rich, chocolate flavor.  Next is a little oil to thin the batter and make the brownies even more fudgy. If you’re oil-free, you could try subbing something like more nut or seed butter, or applesauce.   Once mixed, you can add optional ingredients like dairy-free chocolate chips and raw walnuts! I highly recommend an addition of some kind for texture and added sweetness.  After a short bake in the oven, these little gems are ready! Let cool briefly, slice, and dig in. The amazing thing is they’re delicious warm, room temperature, and cold. So store them at home or take them along with you throughout the day when you need a sweet, energizing snack.  We hope you LOVE these brownies! They’re: Rich Fudgy Easy to make Naturally sweetened Super chocolaty &amp; So delicious These would make the perfect treat to have on hand when sweet cravings strike. They would also be delicious to share at gatherings or make a lovely gift. If you’re into brownies, also be sure to check out our No-Bake Vegan Brownies with Chocolate Ganache, Peanut Butter Black Bean Brownies, Vegan Gluten-Free Black Bean Brownies, and Easy Vegan Gluten-Free Brownies!

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Perfect Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies   The other day, I was thinking through my rolodex of recipes and realized I don’t have a basic vegan gluten-free chocolate chip cookie on the blog. I KNOW. It’s just wrong. So, obviously, I had to fix that. The rest is history. Friends, ready your aprons and let’s bake!  This 9-ingredient recipe starts with aquafaba! Yes, aquafaba knows no bounds. It acts as a binding and leavening agent in these cookies, which is kind of amazing. If you haven’t jumped on the aquafaba bandwagon yet (which is just the liquid from a can of chickpeas), you totally should! Don’t dump that liquid gold out next time you’re making hummus! It keeps in the fridge up to a week and makes so many delicious things (like oil-free granola!).   Next comes your dry ingredients, which are organic brown sugar, vegan dark chocolate chips, almond flour (which is key to keeping these light and tender), and our gluten-free flour blend. Add a little coconut oil and vanilla to your whipped aquafaba, combine with the dry ingredients, and you’re halfway there! These cookies benefit from a brief 30-minute chill before baking. But if you absolutely cannot wait (I mean, like you just can’t), march bravely onward toward baking. I just find they’re easier to work with (and bake better) when chilled.  Friends, you’re going to LOVE these cookies! They’re: Tender on the inside Slightly crisp on the outside Perfectly sweet Studded with chocolate chips Easy to make &amp; SO delicious True story: When we shared these cookies with a friend, she had to hide them from her family because they didn’t trust themselves around the whole batch. Also, they said they were “undetectably” gluten-free. That’s a win in our book! Into cookies?

0,Caffeine-Free Chai Mix | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Caffeine-Free Chai Mix   In college, I had a chai-a-day habit. In fact, I used to swipe a handful of quarters from my dad’s coin jar (sorry, Dad!) on my way out the door to class to treat myself to a chai at a local coffee shop. There’s something magical about the creaminess of the milk balanced with the subtle sweetness and spice. Swoon. These days though? I don’t steal from my dad’s coin jar anymore (promise). Nor do I enjoy chai lattes as often, mostly because I try to avoid caffeine. This mix is my answer to that problem. Plus, just 6 ingredients and 5 minutesare required!  This mix is made up of some of my favorite spices: cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, black pepper, nutmeg, and cloves! After much testing of different ratios, this is the perfect blend (in my humble opinion) to create a dreamy chai latte.  Once added to a jar, simply shake or stir to combine. It will keep up to 3 months in your spice cabinet, but if you love chai like me, it won’t last that long by a long shot. Check out the recipe below for tips on how to make hot and cold chai lattes, as well as other applications for this spice blend!   We hope you LOVE this chai mix! It’s: Spicy Warming Well-balanced Comforting &amp; So easy to make This mix makes the perfect chai latte when cravings strike! Because it’s caffeine-free, it’s suitable for any time of day. But if you want to add some tea, simply cut the amount of dairy-free milk in half and sub that with strong brewed black tea. Sweeten to taste and you’re golden. Pro tip? Add your chai spice mix, sweetener, and warmed milk to a blender to achieve a frothy, hot latte. Swoon!

0,1-Bowl Vegan Apple Carrot Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Carrot Apple Snack Cake   The holiday season is upon us and I’ve been dreaming of sharing an easy snack cake to have around if you happen to be hosting family or friends this time of year. You know, the kind of cake that is justifiable as a “snack” or “breakfast” because it has fruit and vegetables in it. Yes! That kind. Let’s bake, shall we?  This 1-bowl recipe starts with a flax egg for binding and mashed ripe banana for some natural sweetness and moisture. Then come tasty ingredients like brown sugar, grated carrots and apples, and cinnamon.   For dry ingredients, we went for a blend of almond meal or flour, oats, and our gluten-free flour blend, which kept the cake fluffy, tender, yet perfectly moist. Chopped walnuts add a bit of crunch and nutty flavor.  After a quick bake in the oven (and the painstaking minutes of letting it cool), it’s time for cake!

0,"Lentil Nut Vegan ""Meatloaf"" | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf”   Friends, it’s been a long time coming, but my take on a vegan “meatloaf” is here (just in time for the holidays)! And it’s so very delicious. Let’s do this!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and simple methods. I relied on canned lentils (don’t judge) to save time and dishes! Feel free to do the same and proceed to act like you made everything from scratch (I won’t tell).  The base for this loaf is cooked sweet potatoes, mushrooms, lentils, nuts (we went for walnuts and pecans), and fresh thyme. Tomato paste adds moisture and hearty flavor, Worcestershire adds that “umami” effect, and salt and pepper help round everything out. All that’s left is to stir in some gluten-free bread crumbs for texture and transfer to a loaf pan!  For a glaze – I know it’s so basic – we just went with ketchup! It’s simple, and it outperformed more elaborate glazes! Who knew?   We hope you LOVE this loaf!

This seasonal salad relies on winter squash, my favorite 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, pepitas, and dried currants for ultimate flavor. And the 1-ingredient dressing? Yeah, it’s that easy (and utterly delicious). Let me show you how.  This salad comes together with 10 ingredients in 30 minutes! It all starts with roasted acorn squash, which only takes about 10-15 minutes to roast. While that’s happening, start your balsamic reduction (which is simply balsamic vinegar reduced by half until you achieve a dreamy glaze).  Another amazing element to this salad is the crispy sautéed shallot. Simply slice shallot, toss in brown rice flour and salt, and sauté until crispy.

For a while now, I’ve been dreaming up this version, which utilizes dried mushrooms for a richer, more intense flavor and color, and it seriously paid off. Let me show you how easy it is!  This 9-ingredient, 15-minute recipe starts by rehydrating dried mushrooms in vegetable broth. We went for porcini because their flavor is more woodsy and intense. But you can sub whatever mushrooms you’d like (or use fresh – see notes). While that’s happening, start sautéing onions and garlic in a saucepan. For thickener, I went for cornstarch, but you could also sub a gluten-free flour blend, all-purpose flour, or arrowroot starch. Stir to coat and cook for a couple of minutes to deepen the color and flavor.  Next, you’ll add in your rehydrated porcini mushrooms and the vegetable broth as well as fresh herbs. We went for rosemary and thyme to keep things classic. But play with whatever flavors sound best to you. After a few pulses in the blender (or an immersion blender), this gravy becomes deep caramel in color and creamy smooth!   We hope you all LOVE this gravy! It’s: Rich Creamy Earthy Versatile Customizable Easy to make &amp; Seriously delicious This would make the perfect sauce for just about any holiday or special occasion meal.

0,Moroccan Eggplant and Tomato Stew | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Moroccan-Spiced Eggplant and Tomato Stew   Friends, I’ve been dreaming of this dish for so long and it’s finally here (after much toil and experimentation). Whenever we travel abroad, I always try to order eggplant dishes because I love seeing how other cultures prepare eggplant.I try to study the spice mixtures and cooking methods to see how they create such delicate, perfectly seasoned dishes. This recipe is a hearty stew inspired by the flavors of a Moroccan dish called zaalouk – which is a warm salad of cooked eggplant and tomato. I added chickpeas to mine (optional) to make it more of an entrée. Served over rice, it’s near perfection. My version is certainly inspired, and I loved experimenting with the concept of zaalouk to create something that made my taste buds sing (and hopefully yours, too).  This 10-ingredient dish starts with eggplant that’s cubed and roasted until golden brown. While that’s happening, onion and garlic are sautéed with smoky spices like paprika and cumin and then stewed in fire-roasted tomatoes. Maple syrup balances the dish with a little sweetness while harissa paste adds a spicy, smoky flavor. All that’s left to do is add your chickpeas and let it simmer.   We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Smoky Perfectly spiced Easy to make &amp; SO satisfying This would make the perfect dish for slow weekend dinners, or you could make it ahead of time to enjoy throughout the week!

Fall is in full swing over here in our part of the world, so naturally, we have one thing on the mind: comfort food. And nothing spells comfort food like these baked apple cider donuts. Consider them a hug from fall. Let’s bake!  This 30-minute recipe starts with aquafaba! Aquafaba is the liquid from a can of chickpeas, which whips nicely and mimics the properties and texture of egg whites. This not only acts as a binder but also helps the donuts stay light and fluffy! Once whipped, set aside and prepare your simple batter, which is comprised of wholesome ingredients like almond flour, maple syrup, coconut sugar, and our gluten-free flour blend. These donuts get infused with apple flavor two ways: 1) applesauce, and 2) apple cider! Throw in some warming fall spices like cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg into the mix and it’s like a baked apple dream.  ﻿ After a short bake in the oven, it’s time to invert and let cool slightly to firm up. At this time, you can brush your donuts with melted vegan butter (or coconut oil) and dunk them in a cinnamon-sugar mixture! This adds a little more texture as well as sweetness and warmth. Swoon!

0,Caramelized Shiitake Mushroom Risotto | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Caramelized Shiitake Mushroom Risotto   When you’re craving carbs and comfort, risotto is your dish. We’ve made risotto a couple times for the blog before and you all seem to love it. So, with my newfound love for caramelized mushrooms, I couldn’t have imagined a better way to serve up a new spin on risotto. Shall we?  The base for this 10-ingredient, 30-minute recipe starts with warmed vegetable broth, which you can make yourself (for the win), or just grab some store-bought (our favorite brand is Imagine). Next come shallot and shiitake mushrooms, which are sautéed until golden brown. Ideally, the mushrooms start to dry out a little and become deep golden brown and caramelized for the ultimate hearty mushroom flavor. Caramelization happens when the mushrooms have plenty of space to touch the pan without overlapping, so use your largest pan or pot to ensure they have plenty of room to swim.   Once caramelized, it’s time to add your rice, some white wine, and fresh herbs. This is where the flavor begins to really develop. Lastly, add vegetable broth a little at a time, keeping a consistent low simmer and stirring frequently until the rice achieves an “al dente” texture – soft with a little bite.  Once the rice is done, turn the heat off, add your vegan parmesan cheese (or just some nutritional yeast or other vegan cheese of choice), and stir to combine. Mmm – cheesy, hearty carbs.  We hope you LOVE this risotto! It’s: Hearty Cheesy Extremely flavorful Comforting Easy to make Customizable &amp; So delicious This would make a great weeknight meal when you’re craving something comforting and nourishing and need it on the table fast.

0,How to Make Arepas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Arepas (3 Ingredients!)   We have a serious thing for the Portland restaurantTeote. It’s Latin American-inspired and celebrates the arepa in all forms. I’d never had an arepa before dining there, but since that first bite, I’ve been back almost weekly. (It doesn’t hurt that they have a killer vegan bowl there, which inspired this Vegan Black Bean Plantain Bowl!) I started testing arepas of my own recently, but all of my attempts fell slightly short of Teote’s glory. So I did what any sane, normal human would do: I called them and asked for their recipe. And guess what? They basicallygave it to me. Well, at least their secrets. And I totally ran with them. So this, my friends, is it. The key to unlocking perfectly flavorful, crisp-on-the-outside, tender-and-fluffy-on-the-inside arepas! Let’s do this.  This recipe requires 30 minutes, 1 bowl, and just3 ingredients: salt, water (which we don’t count as an ingredient), oil for cooking, and areparina or masarepa, which is a special pre-cooked corn flour specifically for making arepas. I know what you’re thinking: “I’ll just use cornmeal.” Not the same. Or you’re thinking, “I’ll just use masa harina.” Not the same. Trust me – I did lots of testing with many different corn flours and the results were clear: Masarepa (a.k.a areparina) is the only way to go! Plus, once you master this recipe, you’ll be making arepas all the time, so it’s a handy ingredient to have around.   The process is simple: Dissolve salt into the water and slowly add the masarepa until a loose dough forms, stirring with a spoon or your hands. I use my hands because, when Colombian and Venezuelan grandmas use their hands, you follow suit.  Now, the Teote secret lies in two deviations: 1) Mixing both white and yellow masarepa (which I also recommend doing, as it creates a nice golden color but a light texture and a slightly less bitter flavor). and 2) Deep frying (no wonder they taste so good). We did opt for pan frying and then baking to cook the middle all the way through, but by all means, fry away if you want!  Once you get your dough where it should be, let it rest for 5 minutes. Then scoop out fist-size portions and form into a ball. If the edges crack easily or it feels too dry, add a little more water to moisten. It’s a simple dough to work with. Then it’s as easy as rolling into balls and gently forming / smashing into discs.  Once your arepas are formed, simply pan-fry in a little oil to form a crust (a little deep blackening is OK!), and then finish in the oven to ensure the centers are cooked through (optional but recommended). Then enjoy!  We hope you all LOVE these arepas! They’re: Crispy on the outside Tender on the inside Savory Satisfying Easy to make &amp; SO versatile Arepas can be enjoyed plain, on the side of dishes like our Plantain Black Bean Bowl, or cut into a “pita pocket” and stuffed with just about anything, including rice, Black Beans,Vegan Barbacoa, Jackfruit Taco ‘Meat’, or Guacamole (the options are endless). You could also enjoy them with a little vegan butter and maple syrup as a special treat. Mmm.

0,Easy Vegan Ranch Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Ranch Dressing (Oil-Free!)   Being from the Midwest originally, we certainly have a special place in our hearts for ranch dressing. When we were growing up, it was a common dressing for salads and basically the only way we would eat vegetables. If you take a look at the ingredients of ranch dressing at the store, you’ll notice lots of dairy, processed oils, and other not-so-fresh ingredients. Let’s fix that and make our own!  This 10-ingredient, 1-bowl recipe is made with items you likely already have on hand: cashews, lemon, spices, vinegar, and herbs. It starts with soaked cashews for the ultimate creamy base. We tested hemp seeds but found their flavor a little overpowering. So good ol’ cashews it is!  While the cashews are soaking, you’ll make “vegan buttermilk” with almond milk and lemon juice. Then simply add everything to a blender with your spices and herbs and you’re golden! Enjoy right away or chill to thicken.   We hope you LOVE this ranch dressing! It’s: Creamy Tangy Herbaceous Satisfying &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect sauce for salads like our Loaded Kale Salador for dipping fresh or roasted vegetables in! It would be especially tasty with spicy things like our Buffalo Chickpea Wrap, and Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower Wings! Into easy sauces?

This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl to make and comes together in about 1 hour. The reason I love this recipe so much is it’s like eating pizza but without all the bread and grains. That’s right, it’s grain-free!  It starts with socca batter infused with garlic and nutritional yeast for flavor (oregano is optional!). Baking powder provides a little rise, but not so much that the edges don’t get browned and a little crisp. For toppings, we went with red onion, sun-dried tomatoes, vegan macadamia nut cheese, and vegan pesto. But really, whatever you have on hand will work!    We hope you LOVE this pizza! It’s: Flavorful Easy to make Versatile Colorful Wholesome &amp; Uber satisfying This pizza would make the perfect appetizer on Italian night or even the main event when paired with a green salad like this Loaded Kale Salad!

0,Cauliflower Vegan Banh Mi Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Banh Mi   Friends, behold: The Vegan Banh Mi Sandwich. Consider this my spin on the popular, classic Vietnamese sandwich. So many versions I’ve seen rely on tempeh or tofu as the main filling. But I couldn’t help but wonder if the humble cauliflower could step in and take its place, because it’s fast to prepare, absorbs flavors well, and is so delicious when stir-fried. Spoiler alert: It totally worked.  This recipe comes together in 30 minutes! Yep, that fast, which means it’s lunch- and dinner-friendly (quick meals for the win). It starts by quick-pickling radish and carrot in vinegar, a little salt, and sugar. This makes them crispy, salty, tangy, and a little sweet. Next comes the main event: the cauliflower.  First, we marinate it in a simple spicy, savory sauce. Then we sauté and finish by roasting in the oven until tender. Mmm, roasty.   Once the 3-ingredient sriracha mayo is made and the bread is toasted, it’s time to assemble! First aioli, then cauliflower, then pickled vegetables and garnishes. That’s it!  We hope you LOVE this sandwich. It’s: Hearty Crunchy Savory BIG on flavor Quick to make &amp; SO satisfying This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving a sandwich but want something more thanPB&amp;J.

0,Simple Buckwheat Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Everyday Buckwheat Granola  Hey friends! Ready for a bowl of tasty, wholesome, everyday granola? Buckwheat is one of those elusive ingredients that intimidated me when I first learned about it, but the more I cook with it, the fonder of it I become (it’s especially great in our Buckwheat Crepes!). It’s wholesome, gluten-free, and versatile, and it provides a delicious nutty flavor. Plus, it makes extra-crunchy granola, which happens to be my thing. Let’s bake!  This granola is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients to make. It starts with an even mixture of oats and buckwheat groats, but you can easily use all buckwheat groats if you prefer (I just prefer mixing the two for some texture). Next come nuts and coconut, a little cinnamon for warmth, and coconut sugar and maple syrup for natural sweetness.  This granola cooks a little longer at a lower temperature to get an even golden-brown color and super-crunchy texture. This is what we call granola perfection. I wish you could smell it through the screen (swoon).   We hope you LOVE this recipe. It’s: Crunchy Naturally sweet Wholesome Satisfying Easy to make &amp; So delicious This is the perfect healthier breakfast or snack when you’re craving something a little sweet.

0,1-Pot Golden Curry Lentil Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Golden Curry Lentil Soup   It’s about that time of year for soup and lots of it. I’ve had a variation of this recipe in mind for quite some time now (it actually came to me while I was lying in savasana in yoga class – go figure), so I’m happy it now lives on the blog. Friends, let’s make soup!  This soup comes together in 1 pot in 30 minutes! Easy peasy. We start by sautéing garlic, shallot, ginger, and serrano pepper until tender. Then add carrots, which are the primary vegetable in this soup. However, you can also sub other seasonal vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, parsnips, or even pumpkin. Something hearty is preferred.  Next comes vegetable broth and a little coconut milk for flavor and creaminess, along with the lentils for plenty of plant-based protein and fiber. I love the flavor of our DIY Curry Powder, but you can use store-bought (or a similar blend of spices) as well. Coconut aminos adds a little more body and depth. Once the lentils are tender, it’s time to dig in!   We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s: Creamy Nourishing Satisfying Subtly spiced Versatile Comforting &amp; Extremely delicious This would make the perfect dish when you need something nourishing and delicious on the table fast. It’s tasty on its own, but it would also pair well with things like our Curried Quinoa Chickpea Burgers, Spicy Mango Chutney, and Savory Abundance Kale Salad!

0,Smoky Grilled Eggplant | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky Grilled Eggplant   I have a thing for eggplant. Baba ganoush is quickly becoming my favorite dip, eggplant dishes are the first thing I order at Mediterranean restaurants, and Eggplant Parmesan is basically my love language. Yet I have neglected to share a recipe for eggplant in its simplest form: grilled – which is, perhaps, the quickest and most flavorful ways to prepare it. Shall we?  This recipe requires just 9 ingredients and 20 minutes to prepare. The first step it to cover the eggplant in some coconut aminos (or tamari) and a little oil to infuse flavor and prevent sticking when grilled. Then comes the spice blend! I favor smoky flavors like cumin, paprika, and cayenne for eggplant. Coriander adds a little herbal quality, while salt and garlic powder add a kick of flavor. Once it’s well seasoned, all that’s left to do is grill. I prefer a grill pan for ease, but an actual grill is the real deal and provides better flavor. I like placing something heavy on top of the eggplant while grilling – like a cast-iron skillet – to press the eggplant into the grill to get more pronounced grill marks.   We hope you LOVE this eggplant! It’s: Flavorful Smoky Quick + Easy to make Versatile &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect appetizer or side to practically anything Mediterranean-inspired. We love adding it to dishes like our Traditional Vegan Falafel, Greek Goddess Bowl, Ultimate Mediterranean Bowl, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, and Chickpea Shawarma Wrap. Into eggplant?

0,Fudgy Vegan Chocolate Cake Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Fudgy Chocolate Cake Bites   Have you ever wanted chocolate cake but didn’t want to bake a cake? (Yes, I just asked that question.) Or have you ever craved chocolate cake but didn’t want the processed-sugar overload of the real deal? I have just the thing! Behold the fudgy NO-BAKE Chocolate Cake BITE that’s naturally sweetened and easy to make! Let’s (not) bake!  These cake balls require just 7 ingredients (not including the glaze) and 30 minutes to make! Plus, they’re made with simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now. The base starts with dates that are blended into a ball. Then dry ingredients like coconut flour, almond flour, and cacao powder are mixed to create a fluffy, chocolate cake-like texture and flavor. Then the two are mixed together. The final additions? Vanilla extract for that real cake-like flavor, maple syrup for even more (natural) sweetness, and coconut cream for a little fudginess. Swoon!   Once your “cake batter” is formed into a loose dough, scoop into cake bites and chill. At this point, you can enjoy! Or, if you want to go the extra mile, I’ve included not one but TWO glaze options below! The first uses coconut butter for more of a chunky glaze (pictured below), and the second is silky and smooth like ganache. You can’t lose either way!  We hope you LOVE these cake bites. They’re: Fudgy Chocolaty Cakey Rich Easy to make Super satisfying &amp; Mega delicious These would make the perfect healthier treat to have on hand throughout the week when dessert cravings strike! They’re also wholesome and hearty enough to pass as a snack (in our opinion), which makes them great for on-the-go energy bites.

0,Gochujang Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gochujang Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts   We tried a new-to-us restaurant recently in Portland and it was so tasty that I knew right away I had to try to recreate their Gochujang Brussels sprouts at home! Lucky for you, I’ve taken all the guess work out of this delicious side dish or appetizer. Plus, just 7 ingredients and 30 minutes required!  If you’re into Brussels sprouts, you’ll love this dish because they’re stir-fried to golden brown (but still tender) perfection and coated in the most savory, bangin’ sauce on the block: Korean Gochujang Chili Sauce! Have you tried it yet? Most store-bought brands contain gluten and processed ingredients, so I set out to make my own. I’m so glad I did because I’ve been putting it on everything since, like Cauliflower Wings, my saucyCrispy Tofu, and now Brussels sprouts!  It all starts with the sauce, which comes together in 5 minutes. Then just heat a skillet over medium-high heat, add a little sesame oil, and start stir-frying these gems.The sauce coats the Brussels near the end of cooking and adds a nice caramelized effect.

And can I also say that it was a long road to get here? What started as “blender oat pancakes” gone wrong morphed into this supreme stack of golden goodness – the victory was well earned. Let’s make pancakes!  These 1-bowl, 25-minute pancakes require 9 simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Mash a banana, add the wet ingredients, stir in the dry ingredients, and bam: You’ve got a bangin’ pancake batter on your hands.  We prefer cooking the pancakes on a seasoned cast-iron pan very lightly coated with oil (see cast-iron tips in our Instagram Story Highlights!). Brown on both sides and then keep warm in the oven until serving. If you want to be extra (like me), you can sprinkle some chocolate chips and/or blueberries or huckleberries into the batter for next-level pancakes!   We hope you LOVE these pancakes as much as we do! They’re: Fluffy Tender Naturally sweet Banana-infused Easy to make &amp; Kind of perfect These make the perfect special weekday breakfast or lazy weekend treat.

No-bake vegan donut holes! Yes, it’s a thing. Let’s do this!  This 30-minute, 10-ingredient recipe starts with dates and nuts (walnuts or cashews or both), which creates a sweet, slightly nutty base. Next come coconut and almond flour for a fluffy, cake-like feel. This is what makes them more the texture of cake or donuts than an energy bite.  The flavor comes from lemon juice and lemon zest, and the crunch comes from the addition of poppy seeds or chia seeds. Then just roll them into balls, freeze, and prepare your glaze.   For the glaze, I played around with a coconut butter option, but when you add liquids to coconut butter (e.g. lemon juice and maple syrup), it tends to seize up. So I went for a coconut oil-maple syrup glaze instead. However, I do include an oil-free glaze option in the notes!  We hope you LOVE these no-bake “donut holes.” They’re: Naturally sweet Tender Lemon-infused Portable Satisfying &amp; So delicious These donut holes would make the perfect healthier snack or dessert. The lemon juice and zest punch through with a tart kick, which perfectly balances the sweetness of the dates. Plus, that glaze? Total swoon.

Who’s stoked about combining the two? Me! Let’s do this!  This 10-ingredient dinner or side is adapted and inspired by my Crispy Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan, only I took it a step further by adding pizza sauce and vegan cheese! The base starts with thinly sliced eggplant (the thinner the better), which is then dipped in gluten-free flour, almond milk, and finally a crispy breading comprised of cornmeal, vegan parmesan cheese, and gluten-free bread crumbs. Once they’re breaded, simply sauté on both sides until golden brown and then bake in the oven until crispy. All that’s left to do is top with a little red sauce and vegan cheese of choice and bake again until hot. And voila! Eggplant pizza.   We hope you LOVE these mini pizzas!

And this (new and improved) recipe is easy, requiring just8 simple ingredients, 30 minutes, and 1 bowl to make!  The base of this biscuit is a blend of potato starch,almond flour, and cornstarch, which provides a neutral flavor and light, fluffy texture (which is key in biscuits!). Salt adds flavor, baking powder helps them rise, and nutritional yeast (optional) adds a little more flavor. Next comes vegan butter, the fat necessary to create a “flaky” biscuit. Don’t skimp on the fat, folks!     Last but not least is light coconut milk, which provides enough moisture to make a dough. Canned coconut milk is best here! Trust us. We tested others and they didn’t make as delicious of biscuits. Once you achieve a tacky dough, you’re ready to shape and cut out your biscuits! Just a short bake in the oven at a high temp and voila! You have fluffy, tender, gluten-free, vegan biscuits on your hands! Yes, it’s that simple.   I hope you all LOVE these biscuits.

0,Curried Socca Chickpea Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy Curried Socca (Chickpea Bread)   Have you ever tried socca? It’s a new-to-us bread that’s not only vegan and gluten-free, but also grain-free, as it’s made with chickpea flour! And in this Indian-inspired version, we used whole spices to infuse a curry flavor into the bread. Swoon. How do you enjoy socca? So many ways! This recipe in particular works well anywhere traditional naan would, as well as with dips such as hummus and baba ganoush. But you can also use it as a pizza base (just adjust the spices as desired)! We haven’t tried socca as pizza crust yet but suspect that it would make a delightful breadstick (recipe likely coming soon). In the meantime, let us show you how easy it is to make this fluffy, flavorful bread!  This 7-ingredient recipe starts with garbanzo bean flour, salt, baking powder for a little rise, and warm water. This creates the base we add the delicious spices to. For spices, we were inspired by Amy Chaplin’s recipe in At Home in the Whole Foods Kitchen(one of our absolute favorite cookbooks). Whole cumin, coriander, and mustard seed blend well with our homemade curry powder for the ultimate dreamy curry flavor.  Once the batter has rested for 30 minutes – 1 hour, it’s time to cook. Socca is usually poured into a hot skillet to get brown on the edges and the underside. Then it’s transferred to the oven to get fluffy and cooked through. The whole process takes about 15 minutes. Easy peasy. Repeat until all of your batter is used up and you have mounds of fluffy socca on your hands.    We hope you LOVE this socca. It’s: Fluffy Savory Smoky + Spicy Crunchy from the whole seeds Comforting Nourishing &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect snack on its own or bread in place of naan or pita when you need a grain- or gluten-free option. Pair with dips like our Golden Goddess Hummusor saucy entrées like Kitchari. As we mentioned above, socca can also be made into pizza – a concept that’s on our testing list! Stay tuned.

This 10-ingredient recipe comes together quickly and easily with foolproof methods. Inspired by our White Bean &amp; Kale Artichoke Dip, we simplified things even more and removed vegan cream cheese as an ingredient, as it can be difficult to find for some and often contains processed soy (an ingredient many try to avoid). The base is instead made of a simple puréed cashew cream seasoned with nutritional yeast, sautéed shallot and garlic, salt, and pepper. We went for fresh spinach, but you can always use frozen if that’s what you have on hand (just be sure to thaw and squeeze out excess liquid before use). And once the spinach and artichokes are combined with the sauce, simply bake for a few minutes until bubbly and hot. Then serve. Swoon!   We hope you LOVE this dip!

0,1-Pot BBQ Baked Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot BBQ Baked Beans   When BBQ season comes around, my mind goes straight to the beans. I’ve loved BBQ baked beans for as long as I can remember. They’re equal parts savory and sweet with a little spice. My version includes instructions for both dry pinto beans and canned, depending on how much time you’ve got on your hands. Let us show you how easy it is!  This 1-pot recipe starts with pinto beans that are soaked overnight (or at least 6 hours). They’re then simmered with a little vegetable broth and water. That’s where the fun begins.  Mustard is added for a little tanginess, tomato paste for a hearty tomato flavor, coconut sugar for natural sweetness, and chili powder for heat. Next come salt and pepper to taste and an optional dash of hot sauce for a little heat to balance the sweetness. The real secret of these beans comes from a dash of liquid smoke, which adds a smokiness that traditionally comes from bacon. This meat-free version is just as rich and satisfying as the “real deal.”  ﻿ We hope you LOVE these beans! They’re: Hearty Smoky Salty-sweet Subtly spiced Easy to make Super versatile &amp; So delicious These beans would make the perfect side to just about any grilled dish like our Grillable Veggie Burgers, BBQ Black Bean Burger, and Grilled Veggie Skewers.

0,Simple French-Style Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple French-Style Potato Salad   This simple potato salad is inspired by one we tried while in Austin. The potato salads I’m used to having are typically dressed with a mayo sauce, making them thicker and more indulgent. But I loved the tangy, light quality of a potato salad dressed in an herb-infused vinaigrette instead. I later discovered that this is more of a French style of preparing potato salad. I hope you enjoy this inspired version that’s perfect for summer BBQs, lazy picnics, road trips, and more.  This 10-ingredient, 30-minute recipe starts with thinly sliced baby potatoes (we enjoyed a mix of gold and red) boiled until just tender. They’re then seasoned with salt, pepper, and a dash of apple cider vinegar for a layer of flavor.  The dressing is a simple garlicky mustard vinaigrette with both red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar. We found that the combination of these two provide the perfect amount and quality of acidity. Fresh herbs add even more earthy flavor, while olive oil helps create a creamy texture. Swoon.   Once the dressing is prepared, all that’s left to do is add fresh chopped herbs and green onion to the boiled potatoes and combine. This potato salad can be enjoyed warm, at room temperature, and even chilled – our favorite being room temperature.  We hope you love this elegant potato salad. It’s: Light Refreshing Tangy Buttery Satisfying Versatile &amp; Utterly delicious This would make the perfect side to go alongside grill-friendly dishes like Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burgers, Jerk-Style Grilled Eggplant, and Grilled Veggie Skewers. It would also pair well with our Vegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich, Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli, and Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. Into potato salad?

Imagine this: aperfectly baked, tender cookie studded with dark chocolate (or dried fruit!) that’s naturally sweetened, vegan, gluten-free, and grain-free! Plus, it’s made with 10 wholesome ingredients you probably have on hand right now. Let’s bake!  The base of this cookie is inspired and adapted from my Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies. Aquafaba provides moisture and binding (acting as our egg substitute), almond flour and shredded coconut replace traditional flours, and coconut oil replaces butter. To keep things naturally sweetened, we went with coconut sugar and a little maple syrup. To keep these entirely refined sugar-free, be sure to use a bittersweet dark chocolate chip (or unsweetened dried fruit!).   The star of the show is seeds! I used this lovely Superfood Burcha mix, which includes tasty things like pumpkin, flax, sesame, sunflower, and cacao nibs. But you can really use any combination of seeds you want! The result is a cookie with lots of fiber, healthy fats, protein, and a subtle crunch.  We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re: Tender on the inside Perfectly browned on the outside Naturally sweet Studded with dark chocolate Easy to make &amp; Healthier than your average cookie! These would make the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand throughout the week. Store in a cookie jar (because fun)or in the freezer to keep them fresh even longer!

0,Curry Spiced Quinoa Chickpea Burgers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curried Quinoa Chickpea Burgers   I’ve been so excited to share this recipe since perfecting the concept this summer. I’d been dreaming of a curry-infused chickpea burger for a while. And although ittook me several tries to nail, it was totally worth the effort! Friends, it’s burger time.  This 10-ingredient burger is made with cooked quinoa and baked chickpeas. The chickpeas provide plenty of plant-based protein and fiber, while the quinoa helps bind the burger and stay together for cooking. Serrano pepper adds heat, ginger adds spice, and garlic infuses plenty of zingy garlic flavor. Lastly, my go-tocurry powder injects tons of gorgeous flavor in one fell swoop. The last element is cooked potatoes that are mashed, seasoned, and stirred into the quinoa-chickpea mixture. This helps round out the flavor and texture super well and adds even more carby goodness to the mix (swoon).   All that’s left to do is cook! We opted for a quick sauté in a cast-iron before finishing in the oven to continue cooking the burgers through. These would also probably grill well (if done gently).  Might we suggest the perfect way to enjoy these gorgeous burgers? Serve atop lettuce or a green salad and plenty of our Spicy Mango Chutney! The pairing is out of this world! Take it a step further by adding our Green Curry Tahini dressing for even more big flavor.  We hope you LOVE these burgers! They’re: Perfectly tender Hearty Super flavorful Easy to make Great for a crowd Versatile &amp; Super delicious These burgers would make the perfect healthier meal when you’ve got a little more time on your hands and want to impress family or friends.

Say hello to your new favorite (naturally sweetened, incredibly rich, salty-sweet) dessert. Chocolate Peanut Butter Freezer Fudge made with just 4 ingredients, in 30 minutes, and 1 bowl (food processor)! Shall we?  This recipe was inspired by simplicity. I’ve made fudgeI adore in the past, but some people tend to have trouble with their food processors being able to make coconut butter – a central ingredient in that recipe. So I wanted to come up with a variation that would be a little easier to tackle. And thus, freezer fudge was born!  This recipe is made entirely in the food processor. First, dates are processed until a paste or ball forms. Then peanut butter is blended in. Next comes cacao powder for that rich, chocolaty flavor. And lastly, coconut oil makes everything creamy and smooth. Just look at that dreamy goodness. I could hardly keep my spoon out of the bowl!   Simply transfer to a parchment-lined dish, freeze, slice into squares, and you’re golden. Share this fudge with everyone – friends, family, neighbors. They won’t believe that it’s made with simple ingredients and naturally sweetened! It’s kind of incredible!  We hope you LOVE this fudge!

But have you had Cheesy Spaghetti Squash Pasta?! If not, it’s time!  This 9-ingredient recipe starts with roasted spaghetti squash. I typically cut my spaghetti squash in half and roast it using this method. But I wanted to try Beth’s method of slicing it in rings before baking to achieve longer noodles. I’m happy to report that both work well, so do whichever is easiest for you!  While your squash is roasting, soak cashews and then blend with nutritional yeast, lemon juice, garlic, and sea salt for a creamy vegan ricotta cheese sauce! Once your squash is finished cooking, use a fork to separate the flesh into “noodles” and set aside. Then sauté onion and garlic until tender, add squash and cheese sauce, and cook until hot and cheesy! That’s it.   We hope you LOVE this pasta! It’s: Cheesy Flavorful Tender Satisfying Easy to make &amp; Super delicious This would make the perfect side dish for Italian night or entrée when topped with something like our Best Vegan Meatballs!

0,The Best Vegan Meatballs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Meatballs   Friends, this feels big. Vegan meatballs made with real food that are full of flavor, don’t fall apart, aren’t mushy, and are easy to make! Let’s do this!  This 10-ingredient recipe starts with black beans that have been baked to dry them out – this is important, as it helps prevent the meatballs from becoming mushy. The beans are then blended with herbs, spices, and sautéed garlic and shallot for layers of flavor.  Next comes the cooked and cooled quinoa, more herbs, tomato paste, and vegan Worcestershire (which is optional, but it adds more depth of flavor). Pulse a few more times and you’re ready to form your meatballs! After a quick chill in the refrigerator, it’s time to cook (and eat)!  To cook the meatballs, we went for a stovetop-oven combo. A quick sauté in the skillet you used to cook the onions and garlic in provides a crusty outer texture, while a bake in the oven dries them out a bit and ensures they’re cooked through the center. At the end, for even more flavor, you can add your favorite marinara sauce and cook for another 5-10 minutes or until bubbly. Swoon. Then it’s meal time!   We hope you LOVE these meatballs! They’re: Firm but tender Not mushy Packed with flavor Made with wholesome ingredients Protein- + Fiber-packed &amp; Incredibly delicious These meatballs are delicious on their own, but they would also pair well with just about any pasta, like our Simple Chickpea Bolognese or 30-Minute Cashew Alfredoor Chili Garlic Pasta with Roasted Cauliflower.

This 9-ingredient recipe starts with a mix of organic cane sugar (or coconut sugar), coconut oil, and a hefty pour of vanilla. I relied on aquafaba for an egg replacer that is colorless, helps bind, and also contributes to a little rise when baking. For flours, I went with a mix of almond flour,guten-free flour blend, and cornstarch (or arrowroot starch). This keeps the cookies light and provides a slight crunch.

0,How to Make Sauerkraut | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Sauerkraut   My first experience with sauerkraut was when I was working at a sandwich shop in college. The rule was if you showed up late you had to make the “sauerkraut.” It was kind of awful because the sauerkraut was pre-made and came in a giant can, and once you got past the smell, you had to mix it with mayonnaise. Needless to say, it was one of my least favorite tasks and a major motivator to get to work on time. This sauerkraut, however, is nothing like that. It’s homemade from scratch with simple ingredients to help promote a healthy gut (and there’s no mayonnaise in sight). Plus, it’s super easy to master the technique and requires just 7 simple ingredients. Shall we?  The simplest form of sauerkraut is just cabbage and salt, which is where we start in this recipe. Once the salt is added, simply massage with clean hands for 10 minutes or until the cabbage has reduced quite a bit in size and released quite a bit of liquid at the base of the bowl. See the progression in the next two photos.   We’re looking good! Now, let’s add some color and flavor. I went with shredded carrots and beets, which provide a vibrant orange-magenta hue. Next come fresh minced garlic and fresh grated ginger and turmeric for big flavor. The result is a perfectly salted fresh vegetable sauerkraut infused with zesty garlic and ginger and earthy turmeric. Swoon! Mix again to incorporate and you’ve practically made sauerkraut!  All that’s left to do is pack into sterilized jars and ensure the liquid extracted from all that massaging rises up and covers the kraut for optimum fermentation. Then leave it alone to do its thing. Set it on the counter out of direct sunlight or in a cabinet for 1-14 days (or longer) to let it naturally ferment.  We hope you LOVE this kraut! It’s: Tangy Crunchy Fresh Filled with probiotics Garlicky &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect topper for sandwiches, salads, wraps, bowls, and more! Our favorite way to enjoy sauerkraut is with dishes like Kitchari or Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. But it’s even tasty right out of the jar (just don’t double dip to avoid contamination).

0,The Best Whole Roasted Cauliflower | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Whole Roasted Cauliflower (5 Ingredients!)   Behold, the whole roasted cauliflower. This recipe, while it may seem straightforward, threw me for a loop. I roasted 7 heads of cauliflower until I got it just right! But in the end, it was totally worth the effort. There are a couple of secrets to the whole roasted cauliflower game. Let me show you how!  This recipe is easy, requiring just 5 ingredients and simple methods to prepare! Tip #1: Start with a sauce comprised of spices, a little oil, maple syrup, and salt. The result is a flavor-packed marinade of sorts that’s perfect for lathering all over your cauliflower. Tip #2: Flip your cauliflower upside down to let the sauce pour down the core, shake it around so it infuses the center, and then flip the cauliflower over and use a brush to rub the leftover sauce all over the exterior. Tip #3: Add just a pinch more spice and salt to the exterior for even more flavor.   Tip #4: Place a pan with water on the bottom of your oven while baking so the cauliflower steams and gets softer faster. It doesn’t make the cauliflower soggy as long as you don’t over-bake – just perfectly tender all the way to the core. (A tip we borrowed from NYT.) Tip #5: Turn the oven to broil at the last minute to get a browned outer edge. That’s it! Just 5 ingredients and 5 tips to the perfect roasted cauliflower.  We hope you all LOVE this cauliflower! It’s: Perfectly tender Packed with flavor Easy to make Super versatile &amp; So delicious Make this cauliflower as the main dish or an appetizer for dinner parties or weeknight meals! Because cauliflower doesn’t have many calories, we recommend serving it over some cooked quinoa with our go-to Chimichurri Sauce.

0,Peanut Butter Banana Green Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Banana Green Smoothie Bowl   From time to time, I love sharing a recipe I’ve been making organically in my kitchen and enjoying on a regular basis. This smoothie is one of those recipes. It all started with an obsession for banana and peanut butter, which goes way back to my favorite green smoothie. Since then, my taste has become slightly more sophisticated and I’ve been enjoying more adaptogen and green powders in my smoothies for an extra boost of nutrition. We hope you love this smoothie bowl. It’s perfect for all you peanut butter banana lovers out there who also love a healthy dose of greens.  The recipe happens in your blender in about 5 minutes. Banana is blended with cauliflower and blueberries for a creamy, perfectly sweet base.

For a little extra nutrition, we added hemp seeds for healthy fats and protein, spirulina for detoxification, maca to help balance hormones, and ashwagandha to help the body adapt to stress.

0,Vegan Cauliflower Rice Kitchari | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Cauliflower Rice Kitchari   If you haven’t caught on by now, we’re super into comfort food over here. And when it comes to Indian cooking, it doesn’t get much more comforting than kitchari. Kitchari is a traditional Ayurvedic dish that’s typically made when someone in the family is under the weather. That’s because it’s comforting, gentle on the digestive system, and incredibly soothing. Our inspired take on this flavorful dish uses cauliflower rice in place of basmati rice and can be served atop greens, grains, or roasted vegetables. It’s perfect for just about any occasion (whether you’re sick or not). Let us show you how easy this 1-pot meal is.  The one time-consuming thing about this recipe is that you need to soak your moong dal – a.k.a. split mung beans – beforehand, which takes about 6-8 hours. This increases the digestibility and speeds up cooking time. Once soaked, it’s smooth sailing. It all starts with toasting your whole spices along with fresh ginger, serrano pepper, and diced tomato.   Next comes the soaked moong dal, which is sautéed and then simmered in water until tender. Once tender, it’s time to add your cauliflower rice and more spices for big flavor. (We also include an option for basmati rice in the notes if you’re down with grains). Cover and simmer until all of the flavors meld, and before you know it, dinner is on the table. We did it! You did it. Friends, we did it.  We hope you LOVE this kitchari. It’s: Comforting Flavorful Hearty Soothing Fiber- + Protein-rich &amp; Incredibly delicious This is the perfect dish to make ahead of time and reheat throughout the week. It just gets better with time. Make it for yourself or loved ones who are sick – it’s like a hug. Make it for dinner parties. Your friends will love you for it. Our favorite way to enjoy it is with roasted sweet potatoes and beets – because carbs – and some fresh cilantro. Take it to another level with this green curry tahini dressing. Swoon!

But if you’re trying (or prefer) to avoid banana, we include another option in the notes! For anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,and digestion benefits, we included plenty of fresh ginger and ground turmeric. Black pepper boosts the absorption of turmeric, so we added that as well.

Allow us to present this easy, 5-ingredient recipe that delivers crispy, cheesy potato fries that happen to be oil-free. Let’s do this!  The recipe starts with potatoes sliced into thin wedges. We love a heartier, thicker wedge “fry.” But if you’re into thinner fries, cut into more of a classic shape. To get the inside tender and not burn the exterior, start by steaming your potatoes. We adapted this method from our Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables recipe! It works like a charm and partially cooks the potatoes to not only speed the cooking time, but also ensure the insides are fluffy and tender.  Next, it’s time for spices! For big cheesy flavor, we went with nutritional yeast and sea salt. And for a little heat, we opted for chili powder. After a short bake in the oven, you’re good to go!  We hope you LOVE these baked fries! They’re: Crispy on the outside Tender on the inside Cheesy Salty Spicy &amp; SO easy to make These potatoes would make the perfect side or snack, especially on game days or if you’re in need of some serious carbs!

0,How to Make Perfect Steel Cut Oats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Perfect Bowl of Oats   Ah, the perfect bowl of oatmeal – a thing to behold. When we’re sick, craving comfort food, or just want something extra hearty for breakfast, this is our go-to meal. In the hundreds of times we’ve made oats, we’ve found some tricks that elevate the texture, flavor, and tenderness, and we’re stoked to share those with you today. Shall we?  This recipe requires 4 ingredients, 1 pot, and simple methods to prepare. Our top tip is to SOAK. Now, if you can’t find the time to soak your oats ahead of time, that’s fine. We’ve got shortcuts for you in the notes. But if you know you’re having oats the next day, the best way to get dreamy oats is by soaking them overnight in cool water. Soaking not only softens the oats, but it also makes them more tender, quicker to cook, and easier to digest. In a side-by-side comparison, we found that unsoaked oats lacked that fluffy, creamy texture soaked oats provide. So, from here on out, we’ll be soaking. Once they’re soaked, it’s time to cook. Simply bring oats to a low boil. Then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until tender.   Lastly, add in your sweetener of choice, along with cinnamon and flaxseed. For toppings, we can’t resist our go-to Berry Compote(we add chia seeds at the end for thickening + healthy fats!), hemp seeds, nut butter, and banana. Seriously dreamy.  We hope you LOVE these oats! They’re: Easy to make Fluffy Tender Creamy Naturally sweetened Nutritious &amp; SO delicious These oats make the perfect weekday or lazy weekend breakfast. They’re super versatile as well! In the fall, top with roasted apples. In the summer, go with fresh berries or compote. In the spring, go with oranges! The options are endless.

0,Creamy Cinnamon Raisin Peanut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cinnamon Raisin Peanut Butter   Are there foods you just don’t enjoy? For me, it’s raisins. If there are raisins in my granola, you will no doubt see me meticulously picking them out and setting them on the side of my plate. No, thanks. And my go-to movie theatre snack? It will never be Raisinettes. Yeah, no. However, the one exception I will make is when cinnamon is involved. Anything cinnamon raisin is A-OK in my book. So when I sampled some cinnamon raisin peanut butterrecently, I knew it was due time to make my own. I couldn’t resist! Let’s do this.  This 5-ingredient recipe starts with roasted unsalted peanuts. Or, if you can’t find unsalted, just omit any additional salt. These bad guys are whirled around until buttery and smooth. Swoon!   Once creamy, it’s time to add your flavors. We went for a pinch of salt and LOADS of cinnamon. Trust us, 2 Tablespoons seems like a lot, but we started with 1 teaspoon and worked our way up. For some reason, in peanut butter, the cinnamon flavor can get lost, which is why you need so much. Fear not – it’s hard to go overboard. And for sweetener, we went with a little stevia and maple syrup. Too much liquid sweetener may cause the peanut butter to seize, which is no bueno. So, to avoid that problem, start with a little liquid sweetener (like maple syrup) and then sweeten more with stevia or powdered cane or coconut sugar to taste.  Now it’s raisin time! Add your raisins (and a dash more cinnamon) and pulse until combined. Then go to town. It was love at first bite for us.  We hope you LOVE this peanut butter! It’s: Creamy Salty Cinnamony Studded with raisins Naturally sweet Easy to make &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect spread for toast, crepes, pancakes, waffles, bananas, Banana Splits, oats, smoothies, Coconut Yogurt, cookies, and more!

0,Curry-Roasted Fennel Salad & Tahini Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curry-Roasted Fennel Salad with Rosemary Tahini Dressing   So, now that we’ve conquered our fear of fennel (I mean, seriously, what do you do with this ridiculous-looking licorice bomb?), it’s time to move into uncharted, even more delicious territory: salads. This salad is, in a word, irresistible. We dare you to take just one bite. Let us show you how this 30-minute side or entrée is made!   This start of this salad show is the fennel – curry–roasted fennel to be exact. If you fear the pungent, licorice-y taste of fennel, roasting it in a little curry powder and salt takes it to tasty town. (But let’s be real – any vegetable roasted in this curry powder is out-of-this-world delicious. What do you expect? So, much, flavor.)   The next step? Dressing. It was hard to decide on just one, but for simplicity’s sake, we suggest the Rosemary Tahini Dressing from this Amazing Super Cleansing Slaw. The flavors just work. But, if you’re looking to venture outside of your tahini comfort zone, try this 6-ingredient Vegan Tzatziki! We found that it melded really well with the complex flavor of the curry by adding a nice cooling, refreshing finish. You can’t go wrong either way. Once your fennel is roasted, it’s assembly time. For even more protein, fiber, and crunch, we opted for a batch of our Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas. To save time, you could also just use cooked (unbaked) chickpeas or grab some already baked at the store.  We hope you LOVE this salad! It’s: Flavorful Hearty Fresh Crunchy Easy to make Versatile &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect side to bring along to dinner parties or serve alongside mains like these Mushroom Black Bean Burgers or Sun-Dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers.Leaving the chickpeas off this salad makes it more of a side for two to four people(in our opinion). But to make it an entrée for two, add the chickpeas (or cooked quinoa!) for extra heartiness. For more hearty salads, be sure to check out our Loaded Kale Salad, Sweet Potato Avocado Salad, Curry-Roasted Vegetable &amp; Lentil Salad, Mexican-Inspired Salad Cups with Quinoa &amp; Black Beans, and the Abundance Kale Salad with Savory Tahini Dressing.

0,Vegan Mango Coconut Yogurt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mango Coconut Yogurt (Coconut Cult Dupe!)   If you want delicious mango coconut yogurt but don’t want to pay $25* for it, this is the recipe for you. Consider this a fun spin on our 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt to include mango and orange for a thick, tangy, creamy yogurt infused with delicious fruit and vanilla flavor. Serious swoon. Let’s do this!  The base of this 5-ingredient recipe starts with full-fat coconut milk and probiotic pills (brand recommendations for both below!). Once mixed together, let it hang out at room temperature until thick and tangy – about 48 hours seems to be the sweet spot for us.   Once thickened, it’s time to add the flavor! We loved a dash of vanilla extract (or paste), mango purée, and orange zest or juice. Once refrigerated, the yogurt will become even thicker and richer in flavor – this is key! Real talk: The reasonCoconut Cult yogurt costs so much is each 16-ounce jar contains 800 billion active probiotic cultures (some of which are human-derived). That’s a lot! Depending on the brand and quality of probiotic you add, you can get up to that number. But we think anything above 10 billion active cultures is pretty dang awesome (the one we use contains 50 billion). With that said, the cost comparison of 1 16-ounce jar Coconut Cult vs 1 16-ounce jar of our recipe is $24.50 vs. $6.48*(that’s a cost savings of $18.02!). *This cost estimation is for 1 can Whole Foods 365 full-fat coconut milk, 1 1/2 Renew Life 50 billion probiotic capsules, 1/2 mango, 1/2 orange, and a dash of vanilla. That means you have the same amount of delicious, tangy yogurt for a fraction of the cost. Pretty cool, huh? P.S. For more yogurt troubleshooting tips, see our original post for 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt.  We hope you LOVE this yogurt! It’s: Creamy Tangy Naturally sweetened Mango- + Orange-infused Easy to make &amp; Super delicious This yogurt is tasty on its own, but it’s also delicious when added to things like our Coconut Yogurt Cheesecake, Raw Banana Splits, Coconut Yogurt Waffles, or this Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart!

0,Cultured Vegan Sour Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cultured Vegan Sour Cream   Tangy vegan sour cream is here! Let us show you how.  This 5-ingredient recipe starts with soaked cashews. Cashews create the perfect creamy, thick base that’s neutral in flavor. Once soaked and blended, add your probiotics to get the culturing process started.   This sour cream does best with a 48-hour rest/culturing time. The longer it rests at room temperature, the thicker and tangier it will become (just like our 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt!). All that’s left to do is add in your lemon, salt, and apple cider vinegar for flavor and even more tanginess. Swoon!  We hope you LOVE this vegan sour cream! It’s: Tangy Thick Creamy Easy to make &amp; So delicious For flavor variations, stir in some adobo sauce or chipotle hot sauce for a smoky, spicy spin or blend with ripe avocado and lime for an avocado crema! This sour cream would be perfect on just about any spicy or Mexican-inspired dish. We loved it on a simple baked sweet potato with avocado and salsa.

0,Super Cleansing Slaw with Rosemary Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Cleansing Slaw with Rosemary Dressing   If you’re in the mood for a tasty, healthy side, snack, or salad base, this recipe is the one for you! It’s incredibly fresh, colorful, and customizable, and it comes with a new-and-improved tahini dressing. Let’s do this!  This 20-minute recipe starts with shredded fennel, celery, beets, carrots, and fresh parsley and cilantro, which not only creates a hearty base but also provides plenty of health benefits. Parsley and cilantro help gently lift and remove toxins from the body, including heavy metals, pollution, and more! They’re also both high in vitamins and minerals and very hydrating and nourishing. Fennel is high in vitamins A + C, calcium, potassium, zinc, copper, and selenium. It’s also high in fiber, which helps promote regularity (ftw). Celery is high in vitamins B6, C, + K, potassium, and folate. It also has high fiber, water, and electrolyte content, so it’s very hydrating for the body. And its antioxidants and polysaccharides help fight inflammation in the body!   Beetspromote oxygen-rich blood and improvedcirculation. They’re also high in folateas well as amino acids that help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, which in turn helps improve liver function. Carrotsare abundant in fiber and antioxidants like beta-carotene, which help fight free radicals in the body. They’re also high in magnesium, potassium, and vitamins A, K, + C. The nutrients in carrots also help boost and protect your eyesight! Applesare packed with antioxidants, flavonoids, and fiber. They’re also high in vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, and phytonutrients that help protect the body from free radicals. Cabbageis high in free-radical-fighting antioxidantsas well as vitamins K, C, + B6. It also boasts plenty of manganese, potassium, and fiber. Both red and green cabbage work in this recipe, but red will provide slightly more anti-inflammatory benefits due to its higher anthocyanin content. And the dressing adds a bit of healthy fat and creaminess in the form of tahini, an extra boost of vitamin C from lemon juice, and a little love for your gut from apple cider vinegar. Not to mention garlic, which is antibacterial and anti-parasitic, and rosemary for even more antifungal and antibacterial benefits! Also, this dressing TASTES amazing!  We hope you LOVE this slaw! It’s: Colorful Crunchy Fresh Customizable Insanely healthy &amp; Oh-so delicious This would make the perfect salad base to have on hand throughout the week. We enjoyed throwing a healthy serving into our salads and bowls and just enjoying as a snack. Plus, it only gets tastier throughout the week as all the flavors meld together. Swoon.

0,Fudgy Vegan Brownie Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Brownie Cookies  A brownie and a cookie IN ONE. Yes, it’s possible! Dreams do come true. Let’s bake, friends!  These quick-and-easy 10-ingredient cookies are adapted from our Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies. For dry ingredients, we went with cocoa powder, almond flour, coconut sugar, and sea salt. Walnuts and dark chocolate chips add the ultimate brownie factor, while chopped-up dates add more natural sweetness and a sticky, caramel-like surprise to bite into. Swoon! That means these cookies are not only vegan and gluten-freebut also grain-free and naturally sweetened (if you use naturally-sweetened dark chocolate like Eating Evolved).   We relied on aquafabaas the primary binding ingredient for the cookies as well as for added fluffiness. Whipped until soft peaks form, the aquafaba is then mixed with a little vanilla, coconut oil, coconut sugar, and melted dark chocolate to constitute the wet ingredients. When mixed with the dry ingredients, it creates a tacky, semi-wet dough that tastes and smells just like brownies.  After a quick chill in the refrigerator, simply bake for about 15 minutes or until fluffy and dry on the edges. Wait a few minutes to cool (if you can) and then you’ll be diving into these indulgent (yes surprisingly healthy) brownie cookies!  We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re: Fudgy Chocolaty Perfectly sweet Easy to make Slightly crisp on the edges Tender in the center &amp; SO decadent These would make a delicious dessert to have on hand throughout the week. And they would also be a fun treat to bring to group dinners or parties! We could also see them packaging up nicely to give as a gift.

Not only is it hearty and satisfying, it’s also simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients and 40 minutes to make (from start to finish). Let’s comfort food!  The base for this dish is a mushroom and lentil gravy/stew. It starts with sautéed shallot and mushrooms seasoned with coconut aminos, salt, and pepper for rich, deep flavor.

You can go 100 different ways with seasoning mashed potatoes, but we kept things simple: a little salt, pepper, and olive oil, with a few dashes of almond milk for creaminess. SERIOUS yum. For more flavor, you could also add fresh garlic, herbs, or even some vegan parmesan cheese.  All that’s left to do is serve! For garnish, we went for more fresh thyme and a little parsley. Vegan parmesan adds a bit more flavor, but it’s certainly optional.  We hope you all LOVE this dish!

Once the wine cooks down, add warmed vegetable broth one ladle at a time and stir as it cooks until “al dente.” Then just add your vegan parmesan cheese and the sautéed vegetables and you’re good to go! It’s that easy. A few things to keep in mind with risotto:  Always use warmed vegetable broth so it doesn’t halt the cooking when added to the rice. Stir frequently as the rice cooks to prevent sticking. Cook the rice at a simmer instead of a boil so the rice can cook slowly and evenly. Cook until just “al dente” to avoid gummy risotto.   We hope you all LOVE this dish. It’s: Creamy “Cheesy” Flavorful Loaded with fresh vegetables Easy to make &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you need something that’s incredibly satisfying and comforting in a hurry. It would make a delicious entrée or side dish, and it would also work well for dinner parties, as it’s a versatile side dish that complements just about any main.

0,Easy 1-Pot Black Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Black Beans from Scratch  If you can cover beans with water and turn your stove burner on, you can make these beans. From scratch! I believe in us. Let’s do it!  For some of you, making beans from scratch may seem like old hat. But for those of us less experienced (hand raised) in the art of buying bulk beans to cook yourself, this recipe is good news. After a little trial and error, research, and testing, we came to realize that if you want black beans that are flavorful, perfectly tender, and not mushy, they actually turn out tastier, less mushy, and deeper in color when you skipsoaking before cooking. This is wonderful because it not only saves time, but there’s also virtually no prep timeand the beans are ready in less than 2 hours! That’s right! This recipe is super easy, requiring just 6 ingredients and 1 pot to make.   Because the beans aren’t soaked beforehand, it’s a good idea to add a strip of kombu (seaweed) to make the beans easier to digest. And for flavor, add a halved onion and some garlic. Another way to infuse more flavor is to add some vegetable broth to the pot. We prefer a ratio of 3:1 water to vegetable broth. Next, cook your beans until tender. Then remove the onion and kombu and simmer for another 10-15 minutes to evaporate some of the extra moisture. This is also an excellent time to add your salt and other seasonings. For a smoky, spicy note, we added cumin powder and two chipotles in adobo sauce.  We hope you all LOVE these beans! They’re: Easy to make Flavorful Perfectly tender NOT mushy Versatile Healthy &amp; Super delicious These beans are so delicious on their own, but they would also work well with things like burrito bowls, tacos, nachos, veggie burgers and more! We have a fun recipe coming up that puts these beans to good use, so stay tuned! And if you dig this recipe, also be sure to check out our 1-Pot Pinto Beans! If you try this recipe, let us know!

Let’s bake!  This recipe is easy to make, requiring 1 bowl and 10 ingredients. The base starts with vegan “buttermilk” made by mixing dairy-free milk and vinegar. Then add in applesauce for (oil-free!) moisture and natural sweetness and vanilla extract for that quintessential vanilla flavor. YUM.

0,Smoky BBQ Black Bean Veggie Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger  Say hello to your new favorite veggie burger. It’s gluten-free, BIG on flavor, infused with smoky BBQ flavor, and perfect on the grill or stovetop. Let’s do this!  This burger is easy to make, requiring simple methods and 10 wholesome ingredients you likely have on hand right now. It all starts with black beans that are cooked down until dry and cracked, which helps keep the burgers from being mushy. Then comes toasted pecans, which are pulsed into a meal.   Then we add quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, cumin, chili powder, BBQ sauce, and salt. Quinoa adds moisture and also binds the burgers, and the rest is all about flavor: sweet potatoes for sweetness, mushrooms for “meatiness” and texture, and the spices and sauce for smoky BBQ flavor.  For these burgers, it’s best to sear both sides on the stovetop and then finish baking in the oven, where they will dry out and firm up a bit. But they are firm enough for the grill as well! Once cooked, it’s all about the toppings. We went for vegan buns, lettuce, cabbage, red pepper, pickles, and more BBQ + a little hot sauce. Swoon.  We hope you all LOVE these burgers!

Let’s make gluten-free pizza dreams come true!  This recipe requires 10 simple ingredients and comes together in less than 45 minutes from start to finish! The base flours are comprised of almond flour, potato starch, and arrowroot starch. Potato and arrowroot starch are particularly great for this recipe because they help make a firm and crispy-on-the-edges crust that’s also tender in the center. No gooey center, no cardboard edges – just pure, airy, delicious goodness.   We also included some flaxseed for binding (and fiber), olive oil for moisture (which you can sub for water if oil-free), oregano and garlic for added flavor, and vinegar and baking soda to help the crust rise a bit. Having tried a lot of gluten-free crusts (our own, at restaurants, and box mixes), we can confidently say this is the best gluten-free pizza crust we’ve tried and SPOT-ON in flavor and texture. Swoon!  Once your crust is formed, bake for 10 minutes. Then top with desired toppings. We went for tomato sauce, peppers, onions, mushrooms, kalamata olives, oregano, and whipped almond ricotta cheese. But you could go any way you prefer.

It starts with cooked and cooled quinoa and black beans that have been baked. Baking the beans is key, as it dries them out and makes the falafel crispy instead of mushy – a trick I learned from a friend! The quinoa adds moisture and nutrition, and pumpkin seeds add a bit of crunch. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;  The rest of the ingredients are all about flavor: garlic, tomato paste, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, coconut aminos, cumin, coriander, and sea salt.

0,Easy Vegan Gochujang Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Gochujang Sauce (Korean Chili Paste)  In all of the travels we’ve done, South Korea remains one of our favorite countries and Seoul one of our favorite cities. The people, the culture, the landscape, and the FOOD. Oh my word, the food. It’s all amazing. We’ve shared an inspired version of easy kimchi on the blog before, but recently, we were craving that quintessential red pepper paste known as gochujang. It’s spicy, savory, and slightly sweet with so much complexity. Traditionally, the sauce is made and fermented to develop the flavors, but there are also ways to make it more simply (and quickly) – which you know we’re all about. This is my inspired version (not authentic, mind you!) of this curiously complex sauce we’ve grown to love and crave. Let’s get started!  First of all, this recipe is EASY. I mean easy. Anyone can make it. It requires 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, and 1 blender or food processor. It starts with miso as a base, which provides a quicker route to that fermented flavor. Plus, we like using chickpea miso to avoid the possibility of GMO soy. But if you can only find soy miso, that works, too! The flavors are quite similar.  Next comes Korean chili powder or flakes, which we’ve discovered are quite different than other chili flakes. They’re not as spicy as cayenne and more complex than red pepper flake. If at all possible, order some online (link in recipe) or visit an Asian store in your area to see if you can hunt them down. For more flavor, we added some fresh garlic, maple syrup for natural sweetness, and coconut aminos in place of soy sauce for saltiness and depth of flavor. Swoon. What can you use this sauce on? So many things. First of all, it acts as a chili paste in marinades and sauces. Anywhere a recipe calls for chili garlic sauce, you could experiment substituting gochujang for more complex flavor. Bonus: We have a recipe coming soon to show you exactly how we put it to use. Stay tuned!  We hope you LOVE this sauce! It’s: Spicy Savory Bold Easy to make Versatile &amp; Insanely delicious The cool thing about gochujang is it’s not spice-your-face-off spicy. It’s more of a subtle spice because it’s balanced with other flavors. Plus, you can control the spice level when you make your own! So even if you’re typically averse to spicy food, give this one a try! You might be pleasantly surprised. Use this sauce in our Gochujang Spiced Cauliflower Wings to see what we’re raving about! If you’re into Korean food, also be sure to check out our Easy Kimchi recipe. And for instant inspiration for where to use this sauce, give it a try in our Marinated Peanut Tempeh or add it to the dipping sauce in these Collard Green Spring Rolls!

Let’s do taco night!  This easy recipe requires just 30 minutes and includes so many delicious, wholesome ingredients. For my vegetables, I was craving hearty ones, so I went for delicata squash, cauliflower, potatoes, and carrots (not pictured) seasoned with simple spices and roasted until tender.

This easy hot chocolate recipe requires just 7 ingredients and 15 minutes to make. While I have a more basic Vegan Hot Cocoa, I wanted to elevate it to include maca powder (where the feel-good vibes come in) and ensure it was naturally sweetened.  It starts with making our own chocolate base with cocoa butter, cacao powder, and a little carob powder, which intensifies the chocolate flavor and adds a little natural sweetness.   Next comes coconut milk, maple syrup for a little added sweetness, cinnamon for warmth, sea salt to bring out the sweetness,and vanilla to enhance the chocolate flavor. Then comes maca powder, which is an adaptogen rich in minerals like calcium, potassium, iron, and zinc. It also helps boost mood, balance hormones, and support the thyroid. It tastes like something between caramel and honeycomb. In other words, I’m obsessed.  Once everything is mixed and hot, it’s time to serve! Enjoy as is or elevate it even more with homemade coconut whipped cream and more cacao powder.  I hope you all LOVE this hot chocolate! It’s: Rich Creamy Chocolaty Warming Naturally sweetened Surprisingly healthy &amp; So tasty This is the perfect hot cocoa for chilly evenings spent inside.

0,Vegan Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Tortilla | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Sweet Potato Butternut Squash Tortilla  When traveling to Portugal last year, we sampled some seriously delicious food, one dish being a Spanish-inspired tortilla. Traditionally, a Spanish tortilla is a dish that’s somewhere between a gratin and a frittata with plenty of potatoes layered inside – kind of like a potato omelet. I’ve tried many versions at tapas restaurants and was pleasantly surprised that this particular dish relied solely on olive oil instead of eggs and was packed with fresh herbs and garlic for big flavor. Once we got home, I immediately added it to my list to try and recreate, and it was a major success. Let’s do this!  This 8-ingredient recipe is so easy to make, requires just 1 bowl (and baking dish), and starts with plenty of thinly sliced sweet potato and butternut squash. To do this, I relied on a mandolin, but with a little patience, a sharp knife will work as well. Next comes a healthy drizzle of olive oil (or other oil of choice, or see notes for oil-free option*), garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and fresh herbs. That’s it! Simply toss then layer evenly into a baking dish and you’re halfway there.   Around 45 minutes to 1 hour in the oven and voila! You have a plant-based dish that’s comforting, big on flavor, and super delicious.  I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s: Colorful Savory-sweet Nutrient-rich Super flavorful Versatile Quick + Easy &amp; So delicious This is the perfect dish to make when you’re craving comfort foods this winter. It would make a lovely side dish paired with things like our Sun-dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers, 1-Pot Everyday Lentil Soup, 1-Pot Red Lentil Chili, or Saucy Moroccan-Spiced Lentils!

0,Sugar-Free Carob Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sugar-Free Coconut Carob Bars  Recently, I came upon a new-to-me ingredient: carob powder! Have you tried it? It’s like cacao powder, but not. And while it tastes like chocolate, it also has hints of coffee and is naturally sweet (unlike cacao). Once I mixed it with some coconut butterand took one bite (hello, delicious), I knew a coconut carob bar had to happen. Plus, they fit in nicely with the sugar-free theme going on this month. Let’s do this!  This 7-ingredient recipe is easy to make. It all comes together in a food processor. The base is coconut butter, which is easy to make at home. It provides a creamy, coconutty, naturally sweet base for these insanely rich bars. Next comes coconut oil, sea salt, vanilla, and maca powder, though that’s optional. Maca not only adds a honeycomb, caramel-like flavor but also provides health benefits like balancing your hormones and supporting thyroid function. And it boasts minerals like zinc, phosphorous, iron, calcium, and potassium. The star of the show, though, is carob powder, which supports healthy digestion and has calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, copper, and zinc. It’s also a healthy alternative to chocolate for those who can’t enjoy it.  Once the mixture is blended, simply pour into molds of choice and chill. It’s that easy!  I hope you all LOVE these bars! They’re: Naturally (and perfectly) sweet Coconutty Chocolaty Rich Satisfying Healthy &amp; Super delicious These would make the perfect snack or treat to have on hand throughout the week.

Let’s do this!  This recipe is easy, requiring just 10 ingredients (I include substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients below) and simple methods.

This curry requires just 30 minutes to prepare andingredients you likely have on hand right now! For vegetables, I went with sweet potatoes, cabbage, and broccoli because: favorites. But you could sub whatever seasonal vegetable is lingering around your kitchen at the moment. Otherwise, it’s basics like shallot, ginger (hello digestive and anti-inflammatory best friend), curry paste, and coconut milk.  While the vegetables roast away, simply sauté the garlic and shallot (add a pepper for extra heat!) and add in the curry paste and coconut milk plus a little turmeric (nature’s gold dust) and coconut aminos. Then you’re in curry heaven. Serve with cauliflower rice, brown rice, or quinoa for even more deliciousness and comfort factor.  I hope you all LOVE this curry! It’s: Hearty Rich Spicy Comforting Super flavorful Versatile &amp; Amazingly delicious This would make the perfect quick meal to put on the table during the week or when you’re hosting guests, as it’s a crowd pleaser.

0,1-Pot Vegan Lentil Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Everyday Lentil Soup  Everyone needs a good lentil soup in their back pocket for days when you don’t really feel like cooking but want something nourishing on the table fast. This is my go-to version, which happens to require just 10 (basic) ingredients, 1 pot, and a little more than 30 minutes to prepare. Shall we?  The base for this lovely, everyday soup starts with hearty vegetables for plenty of plant-based fiber and flavor. I went with carrots, celery, kale, and potatoes. Garlic and onion are optional (they seem to aggravate some people’s digestion, so I’ve left them as optional in this recipe). And in my opinion, the real flavor magic happens when you add your own Homemade Vegetable Stock (so rich, flavorful, and such a good use of vegetable scraps leftover from the week).  Of course, you can’t have lentil soup without the lentils! I went with green lentils, but you could also sub other varieties if you’d like (just adjust cooking time accordingly). And if you’re not a lentil fan, you could always sub cooked beans, such as white beans or chickpeas – both would be lovely here.  I hope you all LOVE this easy, everyday lentil soup. It’s: Hearty Flavorful Vegetable-packed Fiber- + Protein-rich Super healthy Easy Versatile &amp; Seriously delicious This is my go-to meal when the weather gets cold and I want a no-fuss meal on the table fast.

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Buckwheat Crepes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Buckwheat Crepes  If you’re looking for a new breakfast recipe for lazy weekend mornings, I have just the thing for you. A crepe is like having a mini burrito for breakfast, and quite frankly, who wouldn’t want that? Plus, the flavor options and filling possibilities are endless. Let’s do this!  This crepe recipe was inspired by a new-to-me Youtube channel,Cam and Nina, which focuses on making vegan food easy and delicious – something we’re all about. So when I saw they had a crepe recipe that was both vegan and gluten free – a recipe I’ve been trying to tackle for years now – I had to give it a try. And I must say, with a couple of small tweaks, I’ve made it my own and am totally in love with the result. One of the best things about this 30-minute, 5-ingredient recipe is it’s SO versatile. It can be made oil-free, sugar-free, sweet, and savory, and the filling/topping options are endless. It’s just a good, hearty, basic crepe that you can make your own depending on what you’re craving.  This recipe is made with a simple mix of (untoasted*) buckwheat flour (a hearty, gluten-free grain), dairy-free milk, a little oil, salt, and sweetener / seasonings of choice. That’s it!

0,Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas  Friends, the day has arrived! The day that actually crispy (not fried) chickpeas can happen in your kitchen! Like, it’s a real thing! Let’s do this!  The magic of this 4-ingredient, easy recipe starts with cooked chickpeas. I went for canned because: easy. But I also suspect you could use home-cooked if that’s your thing. The #1 crispytipis to rinse, drain really well, then dry really well. Like, really, really well. The less moist (ew, sorry) the chickpeas are, the crispier they will become!  Once your chickpeas are dry, this brings me to tip #2: Peel the skins! Peeling the skins is onerous and annoying. Yes, I know. But in my experience, it does help them crisp up a bit more in the oven. And when it comes to crisping chickpeas, every little bit helps!  Now, it’s time for oil (if oil-free, you’ll omit this step) and salt. This brings me to tip #3: You’ll want to wait to add any other seasonings until after they’re done baking. I’ve found that too much seasoning can interrupt the crisping process, almost by trapping in the moisture and not letting the chickpeas “breathe.” Next step is tip #4: Bake at 350 F (176 C) for 45-50 minutes. In experimenting, I found that, at too high a temperature, the chickpeas burn quickly while being tender in the center. And if too low, no crisping seems to happen for a very long time. So 350 degrees is the sweet spot. Tip #5 is to let the chickpeas cool once out of the oven, and tip #6 is to store without a sealed lid. Doing so lets the chickpeas breathe and stay crispy longer than just 1 day.  That’s it, friends! You now have crispy chickpeas. They’re: Crispy Flavorful Simple to make Versatile Healthy Snacky &amp; SUPER delicious I love these chickpeas as a straight-up snack at home or on the go. They’re also great atop things like salads, soups, and Buddha bowls! Try these chickpeas with my Garlicky Kale Salad, Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Butternut Squash Pizza, Greek Goddess Bowl, or Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl! They’d also be equally tasty on my Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes. What I’m saying is: They’re delicious on pretty much everything! If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Sunflower-Coated Cheesy Kale Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sunflower-Coated Cheesy Kale Chips  If you’re into kale chips, this is definitely a variation you need to try! It requires simple methodsand 7 wholesome ingredients, and it yields BIG flavor. Let’s do this!  The base for this recipe is a cheesy sauce made with sunflower seeds, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and a few extra seasonings. The sunflower seeds are soaked then blended so this creamy goodness can coat the kale and help it crisp up (into chips – duh).  The key to the coating process is to have the kale thoroughly coated but avoid areas of serious clump! If you have any kale with a lot of the seasoning, it can have a tendency to remain a little tender after baking (which is not what we want). So coat, spread, and remove any excess. Then bake!   I hope you all LOVE these chips! They’re: Crispy Cheesy Seriously flavorful Super healthy Easy to make &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect snack to have on a lazy day at home or if you’ve made a dip and want something healthy to go along with it (think 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese,Easy Red Salsa, Garlicky Guac, or Lentil Dip).

0,Moroccan Lentil Stuffed Eggplant | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Moroccan Lentil-Stuffed Eggplant  Did you make those Saucy Moroccan-Spiced Lentils yet? I hope so, because I have the perfect application for them. Let’s do this!  This recipe requires 9 ingredients and comes together in about an hour. The lentils are added to crushed tomatoes and seasoned a bit more. Then they’re simmered to perfection. In the meantime, slice eggplants (I include two methods in this recipe!) and prepare for stuffing.   Once your eggplants have browned , it’s time to top them with your lentils. I also seasoned mine with a bit of vegan parmesan cheese and gluten-free bread crumbs for extra crunch, which I highly recommend!  For those stuffing the eggplant, simply bake until bubbling and golden brown and you have one saucy, satisfying dinner on your hands.  And for those slicing and rolling, your final product will look more like this!  In my opinion, the roll-ups are a prettier presentation that requires less cooking time.

I like to start by cooking my quinoa and roasting my vegetables, which takes the most time. If you know you’d like to have this salad several times during the week, double the amount of quinoa and roasted vegetables and reheat/use as needed to save time.  While the vegetables and quinoa are cooking, move onto the dressing, which consists of 3 easy ingredients: tahini, lemon juice, and maple syrup. A sprinkle of salt is optional, but it adds a bit more flavor. And if you aren’t into tart-sweet dressings, I’ve included a savory version in the notes.  All that’s left is serving! Add any additional seasonal vegetables or toppings you desire. I opted for broccoli sprouts and hemp seeds for added nutrients, protein, and healthy fat.  I hope you all LOVE this Loaded Kale Salad!

And while that happens, it’s time for the sauce. To create a super flavorful and quick sauce, I blended onion, garlic, and red bell pepper with spices like turmeric, paprika, and cayenne. Tomato paste adds depth of flavor, and apple cider vinegar adds a little acidity. It’s the perfect mix of bold flavors I was looking for.  All that’s left to do is add the sauce to the lentils with some fresh herbs – like parsley and cilantro – and stir to combine. Yeah, it’s that easy!  I hope you all LOVE these lentils. They’re: Saucy Tender Flavorful Smoky Subtly spiced Versatile &amp; Insanely delicious! This would make the perfect side dish or addition to salads, wraps, sandwiches, rice bowls, and more!

0,Herbed Green Cranberry Salad with Vinaigrette | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Herbed Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette  When I was dreaming up this recipe, I was seeing bright, vibrant colors: electric-green mint, magenta cranberries, and golden-brown pecans. Oh, and I was also thinking about the flavors. Don’t you worry. This herbed green cranberry salad is a total flavor bomb! Let’s do this!  This 30-minute recipe all starts with a sumptuous cranberry compote we’re going to turn into a creamy vinaigrette. Cranberry compote is so simple to make. Simply boil with a sweetener, some zest, and citrus juice for 10 minutes and voila! You’re ready to go.  Next, simply blend or whisk with red wine vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, salt, and pepper and you’ve got a creamy, tangy, naturally sweet dressing on your hands.  Another star ingredient? These 1-pan roasted candied pecans. I know! Simply toast raw pecans on the stovetop.Then drizzle on some maple syrup, coconut oil, coconut sugar, and some spices and you’ve got 8-minute candied pecans. It’s that easy.  All that’s left to do is plate and serve. I went with mixed kale and romaine for my base. Then I dressed it with crunchy cucumbers, fresh mint and parsley, and the candied pecans. For more “oomph,” I also added some of my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese (total swoon fest) and some baked crispy chickpeas. These toppings are optional, but they add more protein and fiber to the mix, as well as flavor and texture.  I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s: Fresh Satisying Flavorful Savory + Sweet Versatile &amp; Super delicious! This would make the perfect side or entrée for holiday festivities, dinner parties, or when you want a more exciting salad on the menu during the week.

0,Gluten-Free Cinnamon Rolls (Vegan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Cinnamon Rolls  Friends, behold: The Gluten-Free Vegan Cinnamon Roll. They’re like the unicorn of the gluten-free, vegan baking world. Many have attempted, few have succeeded. Yet I knew they existed and were possible if I just believed (and tried and tried again and again). After 11 – read ELEVEN – attempts, I believe I’ve nailed it. Let’s bake!  These cinnamon rolls are surprisingly easy to make. They require just 10 ingredients you likely have on hand right now (!!) and come together using simple methods. If you’ve ever been intimidated by yeast in baking, don’t be! I include my favorite yeast below, and as long as you don’t overheat your almond milk, you’re golden. It should activate right away and help your rolls rise to the heavens.  The cinnamon roll dough is kept light and fluffy with a blend of gluten-free flour and almond flour. Vegan butter adds flakiness to the exterior and moisture to the interior, creating that perfect tender-on-the-inside, flaky-on-the-outside cinnamon roll. YUM.  The one part that looks intimidating (but totally isn’t) is the rolling-out process. Simply line a cutting board with plastic wrap, dust with gluten-free flour, and plop your dough down. Then top with more plastic wrap and roll into a thin rectangle. And voila! You have a perfect cylinder for cutting your rolls. See? I told you we could do it.   Next is a short rise on a warm oven so the dough can expand. Once the rolls are almost touching, it’s time for a short bake in the oven. We’re so close, friends. So close!  Whoop! Behold: perfectly crisp and tender cinnamon rolls. At this point, you can glaze or not glaze. But…glaze. I include two frosting options below so there’s something for everyone.  I hope you all LOVE these rolls! They’re: Tender on the inside Flaky on the outside Cinnamon-spiked Perfectly sweet Easy to make &amp; Seriously delicious! These would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast or special occasion dessert (like the holidays!).

0,Vegan Dark Chocolate Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Dark Chocolate Bars  Friends! You probably know this by now, but I have a thing for chocolate (e.g.Chocolate Pancakes, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Brownies, Chocolate Energy Bites, Chocolate Cake). The obsession is real. I’ve even shared how to make vegan chocolate before! But I couldn’t help but share my most recent obsession: my go-to vegan dark chocolate recipe when cravings hit. Let’s make chocolate!  This 5-ingredient recipe is very similar to the coating for my Tahini-Stuffed Dates (a.k.a. Tahini Bombs!). The base starts with a mixture of a little coconut oil and mostly cocoa butter, which adds an intensely delicious chocolate aroma and flavor and a lovely creaminess to the chocolate. I’ve found that, if you only use coconut oil, the chocolate is almost too melty to hold on to and way too hard right out of the freezer. This combination makes the perfect base!  ﻿ The next step is cocoa powder or cacao powder. I’ve found that mixing the two gives the perfect chocolaty flavor that isn’t too overwhelming. Plus, cacao powder can be quite expensive, so I like adding only 1/2 cup instead of 1 full cup (#savings). To keep things naturally sweetened, I go for just a little maple syrup. You could also sub stevia to keep these entirely sugar-free or agave if you don’t have maple syrup. But, for best flavor and subtle sweetness, maple syrup is my go-to. Two optional flavor add-ins are sea salt and vanilla extract, which contrast the sweetness well and complement the flavor of the chocolate beautifully. Not essential, but they certainly take these to next-level dreaminess.  Once your chocolate is mixed, I like pouring mine into molds and topping with cacao nibs, which add that beautiful texture and a bit of crunch to the bar. Where my fellow texture freaks at? Creamy + crunchy = dream factor 1,000. And that’s it! Freeze until you’re ready to eat and enjoy.  I hope you all LOVE my go-to vegan dark chocolate bars. They’re: Creamy Rich Flavorful Chocolaty Perfectly sweet Easy to make Customizable &amp; Seriously delicious These are the perfect naturally sweetened, healthier dessert to have on hand for treats throughout the week. I like keeping mine in the refrigerator and breaking off a bite after dinner. The sugar content is so low (only 2g sugar per half-bar serving!) that I don’t feel bad at all for indulging daily.

0,Easy Vegan Caramel Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Caramel Sauce  Friends, what we have here is some seriously creamy, dreamy vegan caramel sauce, and I cannot WAIT to share this recipe with you. Let’s do it!  The base for this 5-ingredient caramel is coconut cream, dates, and arrowroot starch, which are blended until creamy and smooth. This makes up the liquid ingredients, which are added to a bit of coconut sugar and cooked until glossy and just bubbly. The whole process for this naturally sweetened sauce takes just 10-15 minutes! And bam – it’s ready to go. While it’s perfect right out of the saucepan, it also stores well in the refrigerator, where it takes on a slightly lighter color and is super tasty by the spoonful as a midday treat. (What? Who said that? Me. It was me. I did that. Several times.)  You can see in the photo below that the caramel on the right is fresh from the saucepan, and the caramel on the left has been refrigerated for 24 hours and has taken on a much lighter color. Mmmm, dreamy.   I hope you all LOVE this caramel! It’s: Creamy Smooth Caramel-y Perfectly (and naturally) sweet! Slightly salty So easy to make &amp; Super delicious This is the perfect caramel sauce for things like Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream, Vegan Apple Pie, Ice Cream Snickers Bars, Caramel Frappuccinos, Cinnamon Baked Apples, Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tarts (!), Deep Dish Apple Crumble Pies, Vegan Samoas, and Apple Pie Sundaes!

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan  When the weather gets colder outside, I start craving all the warm, comforting, cozy meals. Think chili, shepherd’s pie, and hearty dishes like eggplant parmesan (which is on weekly rotation in our household)! This is new my go-to crispy, gluten-free version that’s so easy to make, customizable, and insanely delicious. Let me show you how!  This 10-ingredient recipe starts with thinly sliced eggplant. My original version required salting and rinsing the eggplant to remove bitterness, but having tested it both ways now, I’ve found that it’s an unnecessary step and one that adds too much moisture to the eggplant. Especially when working with gluten-free flours and bread crumbs, extra moisture decreases the level of crispiness you can get on the eggplant. Plus, not salting saves time, meaning this dish is ready in about 45 minutes start to finish.   The breading process is simple: Dust in gluten-free flour, dip in almond milk and cornstarch, and finish up with a mixture of gluten-free panko bread crumbs, vegan parmesan cheese, and cornmeal. I’ve found this mixture to create the perfect breading for ultra-crispy eggplant rounds. Next, sauté over medium heat until light golden brown, and finish up in the oven until crispy. That’s it!  I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s: Crispy “Cheesy” Flavorful Comforting Satisfying Easy to make &amp; Super delicious This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving something plant-based but super hearty. It even satisfies picky eaters with its crispy texture, hearty dipping sauce options, and the fact that it pairs so well with pasta (hello, carbs, I’m Dana and I love you). This dish is tasty on its own, but it would also pair well with my Vegan Niçoise Salad, Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables, 1-Pot Vegan Minestrone, and Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodles!

0,Romesco Soup with Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Romesco Soup with Smashed Chickpeas  Friends, I’ve been SO excited to share this recipe with you ever since I perfected it a while back. It’s inspired by a soup we had at a vegan cafe in Iceland called Kaffi Vinyl. It reminded me so much of romesco sauce, which finds its roots in Spanish cooking. Romesco is traditionally made with almonds (or other nuts) peppers, garlic, and red wine vinegar. As you can imagine, my mind was spinning with ideas on how to recreate this soup once we got home, and the final result totally blew me away. Let’s make soup!  This recipe is quite easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients andsimple methods. It all starts with roasting red bell peppers, almonds,and garlic until brown and toasty. Then they go into the blender with spices like paprika, sea salt, and harissa for a smoky, spicy flavor.  And the magic comes next: We add our Homemade Vegetable Broth which transforms this sauce into soup! All that’s left is a little red wine vinegar for acidity, maple syrup or coconut sugar for a bit of natural sweetness, and a bit more salt for overall flavor balance.  I also added chickpeas for more heartiness and plant-based fiber and protein!  I hope you all LOVE this soup! It’s: Hearty Rich Flavorful Vegetable-Packed Fiber- + Protein-rich Satisfying Comforting &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect lighter yet satisfying meal when you want something on the table fast. It would feed a crowd or be perfect for making ahead and packing as leftovers for lunch throughout the week. This soup is absolutely delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with things like my Apple Pecan Arugula Salad, Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, Vegan Pesto Parmesan Breadsticks, Fluffy Vegan Spelt Rolls, Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables, or Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower Steak.

0,How to Make Vegetable Broth | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Vegetable Broth  Friends! I’m so excited to bring you this delicious kitchen staple that is SO easy to make. I’ve been telling all of my friends how they should start doing it, too. Consider yourself part of the inner circle who gets in on a secret: Making vegetable broth is what all the cool kids are doing. Let me show you how!  This broth is easy to make, requiring just 1 pot and basic ingredients you likely have on hand year-round. The inspiration for making my own broth originally came from my palPhoebe, who shared in her wellness book about making broth from vegetable scraps and garlic and onion skins collected throughout the week. BRILLIANT! Why had no one told me this before? Ever since, I’ve been saving a big bag of vegetable scraps (carrot peels and tops, greens on their last leg, onion ends, etc.) in a bag in my freezer, and when it’s full, I know it’s broth time.  I start by sautéing the sturdier vegetables down until soft and tender. Then I add water, salt, pepper, and herbs. Herbs add the “umami” to the soup, in my opinion. I went with fresh thyme, parsley, and rosemary and a bay leaf for good measure. And for even more depth of flavor? Tomato paste and nutritional yeast! I know it sounds like an unlikely combination that makes this broth cheesy and tomato-heavy. But a little goes a long way in adding extra “oomph” to the broth and helps take it from vegetable water to AMAZING broth!  After about 1 hour of simmering on low, the flavors develop and your broth is ready to go. Of course, you can cook it longer (the longer the better, really). But 1 hour is about the minimum for truly delicious broth. All that’s left to do is strain into storage jars and you’re set!  I hope you all LOVE this broth! It’s: Hearty Rich Flavorful Versatile Easy to make Healthy &amp; Super delicious This broth makes the PERFECT base for soups, sauces, gravy, and all kinds of recipes, like my1-Pot Vegan Minestrone, Simple Vegan Stuffing, Easy Vegan Poutine, Thyme &amp; White Bean Pot Pies, Mushroom &amp; Leek Risotto, Tomato &amp; Vegetable White Bean Soup, 1-Pot Curried Lentil Potato Soup, and Coconut Curry Ramen.

Thankfully, they seem to be readily available and a great way to get in some vegetables and fruit, which helps me feel a bit more “in my routine” even when I’m not. This creamy avocado smoothie was inspired by a recent trip to Iceland, where I hit the smoothie jackpot. Let me show you how it’s made!  This creamy avocado smoothie is easy to make, requiring just 5 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes. The base is frozen banana, which creates a creamy, naturally sweet base. Next comes the star ingredient: avocado! Full of fiber and healthy fats, avocado makes this smoothie creamy and dreamy and thick, almost like a milkshake.  Next comes dairy-free milk for a smooth and dreamy texture and some greens of choice for fiber, nutrients, and a beautiful green hue. Protein powder is the final ingredient, which takes this smoothie into meal territory. I’ve done a whole review on protein powders, so give it a look to see my favorites.  I hope you all love this smoothie! It’s: Thick + Creamy Satisfying Naturally sweet Gorgeous Full of vitamins and minerals Fiber- + Protein-rich Versatile &amp; Super delicious Try making this smoothie in the morning for a quick on-the-go breakfast.

0,Vegan Pumpkin Mac 'n' Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Mac ‘n’ Cheese  It’s pumpkin season (!!) and I haven’t been able to shake the idea of pumpkin pasta from my mind since I spotted the first pumpkins at the grocery store. Friends, let’s make creamy, dreamy pumpkin mac ‘n’ cheese!  This easy pumpkin pasta requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods. I even show you how to roast a pumpkin so you can impress your friends and family with this from-scratch meal. (Or buy canned pumpkin to save time!) Once your pumpkin is roasted, it’s time to make the sauce, which is a simple mixture of ingredients like sage, garlic, nutritional yeast, almond milk, and vegan parmesan cheese. I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice to add some warmth and spice as well as an optional pinch of red pepper flake for some heat.  Once you cook your pasta, all that’s left to do is mix it with your sauce and serve! I opted to sprinkle on more vegan parmesan cheese, broil for a crusty topping, and garnish it with a bit of sautéed sage (which I consider extra-fancy but nonessential touches).  I hope you all LOVE this pasta! It’s: Creamy Cheesy Pumpkin-infused Satisfying Comforting Easy to make &amp; Super delicious This would make the perfect meal when you’re craving something hearty yet healthy this fall and winter.

0,Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart  Friends, the holiday season is upon us and I’m so excited to offer up this easy plant-based dessert everyone will love and no one will suspect is dairy- or gluten-free. Let’s do this!  The crust for this gorgeous 10-ingredient tart is a blend of rolled oats and almonds naturally sweetened with a hint of coconut sugar and maple syrup. Coconut oil adds moisture and allows the tart to crisp up in the oven beautifully. Next is the filling, which is a simple blend of ingredients like coconut yogurt, soaked cashews, maple syrup, and lemon. The filling is poured over the baked (and cooled) crust and cooled as we work on the topping!  For a topping, I put my Cinnamon Baked Apples to good use. They’re naturally sweetened, require 1 bowl, and come together quickly while the tart chills. And before you know it, you have a gorgeous fall dessert on your hands that’s perfect for just about any occasion.  I hope you all LOVE this tart!

This easy recipe requires just 10 ingredients (2 more if adding these dreamy balsamic mushrooms!) and simple methods to make. The base is a simple mixture of vegetables and lentils simmered with fresh thyme in vegetable broth until tender and flavorful. Next up? If you dare, these balsamic-glazed portobello mushrooms, which add another layer of hearty goodness to this pie.  For topping, in place of traditional white potatoes (like in my 1-Hour Vegan Shepherd’s Pie), I went for sweet potatoes (the best potatoes, in my opinion). Simply boil then mash with a little salt and coconut oil. Then it’s time to layer up all of this goodness.  First, lay down the lentils and vegetables. Then add the balsamic portobellos (optional but dreamy!). And then top with fluffy mashed sweet potatoes. Swoon! Just 20 minutes in the oven and you’re good to go!  I hope you all LOVE this shepherd’s pie! It’s: Hearty Comforting Healthy Satisfying Flavorful Versatile &amp; Delicious!

0,Vegan Ricotta & Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Ricotta &amp; Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Salad  I know that summer is over and all (at least on this side of the planet), but can we please pretend like the sun is out and we’re in tank tops, riding bikes to get ice cream? Or at least can we keep making pretty salads for lunch? I can settle for the latter if you throw in a fireplace (’cause dang, it’s cold outside). Deal.  This salad was inspired by a sandwich I had when we werein Iceland. I found a juice shop (Jo &amp; The Juice!) that served up sandwiches on GF bread with a pesto-y dressing, fresh tomatoes, and ripe avocado. Swoon. I had intentions of making a similar sandwich as the recipe. But, honestly, I need more greens (and less bread) in my life right now, so salad it was. (However, this would be bomb with avocado on toasted sourdough instead of greens.)  This recipe requires less than 30 minutes to throw together even with the Easy Vegan Pesto dressing and Whipped Almond Ricotta. The only other elements are cooked chickpeas and pine nuts for some plant-based fiber and proteinand sun-dried tomatoes for texture and depth of flavor. You could also throw in some avocado, but I didn’t find it necessary. And for more carbs (#carblife), toss in some cooked gluten-free pasta (like this Pea Pesto Pasta Salad!).

0,Easy 1-Pot Marinara Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 1-Pot Marinara Sauce  With as much pasta and lasagna as I cook in my kitchen, I don’t know why it took me so long to share my favorite marinara sauce recipe with you. In any case, it was worth the wait. Let me show you how simple it is to make this basic kitchen staple.  This 1-pot, 9-ingredient recipe is forgiving. As long as you start with quality tomatoes and herbs, the rest kind of happens naturally. Plus, I include a couple of hero ingredients that save the day if things are tasting lackluster (a cook always need a good backup plan).  I prefer using canned crushed, peeled tomatoes, but diced work as well. In fact, I keep a few cans in the kitchen at all times in case I need a quick penne and red sauce to save the day. Next comes flavor in the way of garlic, fresh basil, oregano, red pepper flake, and sea salt. Coconut sugar keeps things naturally sweetenedand may seem like an unlikely addition. But sometimes tomatoes can be a bit astringent and bitter, and because this marinara is quite salty, the sweetness balances and enhances the flavors of the sauce. And what if, at the end, it just needs some extra oomph? Tomato paste and nutritional yeast to the rescue (for a little “umami” effect and more depth of flavor – trust me on this one).  I hope you all LOVE my take on marinara. It’s: Hearty Rich Flavorful Easy to make (1 pot!) Healthy Versatile &amp; Perfect for pasta night This is the perfect sauce for dishes like Spaghetti Squash Pasta,Eggplant Lasagna Roll Ups, Easy Vegan Pizza, Garlicky Pesto Breadsticks (for dipping), Vegan Meatballs, Chickpea Bolognese, Lentil Bolognese, and more. Add a dash of Vegan Pesto to the sauce for an even herbier flavor. Or a spoonful of my Vegan Tofu Ricotta or Whipped Almond Ricotta to take it to the creamier side!

Because everyone knows that the world needs more (cashew) queso. Truth.  This easy weeknight meal comes together relatively quickly if you already have your queso made (which I usually do, and you probably should, too). And itrequires 10 fall-friendly ingredients that remain incredibly versatile depending on what you have on hand. I’ve been stocking plenty of squash in the house lately, and because butternut squash is slightly sweet, I knew that it would play well with cumin, chili powder, and – of course – my Roasted Jalapeño Queso. But, really, any squash (or sweet potato!) should play well here.  For other toppings, I went with fresh red cabbage (which you could also sauté if you prefer it more tender), ripe avocado, and shishito peppers (any pepper will do!) For more protein (which I wasn’t too worried about thanks to the cashew queso), you could easily add something like cooked black beans, Smoky Chipotle Tempeh, or even quinoa.  I hope you all LOVE this butternut squash bowl! It’s: Hearty Comforting Fall-inspired Versatile Super flavorful &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal or even a great dish for hosting, as the recipe can easily be double or tripled.

Easy weeknight cauliflower rice stir-fry to the rescue!  This easy, versatile,30-minute recipe starts with my favorite rice substitute: cauliflower! It’s neutral in flavor, marries well with so many dishes, is full of fiber, and adds even more plant-based goodness to this dish. There’s nothing wrong with rice, by the way (let me make that clear!). But some days you just need more vegetables in your life. (Raise hand if this is you, or am I the only one?)  The sauce is vibrant, flavorful, and made of ingredients you likely have on hand right now like almond butter, maple syrup, lime juice, coconut aminos (or tamari or soy sauce), and chili garlic (or hot) sauce. The beauty of this recipe is you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I went with green beans, bell pepper, cabbage, and green onion. But, really, the options are endless.

0,How to Roast Spaghetti Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Roast Spaghetti Squash  If you’ve ever wondered how to cook a spaghetti squash, you’ve come to the right place. Let me show you how with this step-by-step tutorial! You’ll have ready-to-eat spaghetti squash on the table in less than hour. It all starts by halving your squash and scooping out your seeds, which I love to do with an ice cream scoop for efficiency. Then, it’s into the oven to roast. You can either go for an oil-free version with some water added to the pan for moisture, or – my preferred – brush the inside with a little oil and sprinkle of salt and roast in a 400-degree oven for 45 minutes or until fork tender.  Then it’s the fun part! Use a fork to make “spaghetti noodles” out of the squash, at which point it’s ready to enjoy with a little olive oil, vegan parmesan cheese, and sprinkle of salt and fresh herbs, Easy Vegan Pesto, or red sauce!

0,Dark Chocolate Coconut Butter Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Chocolate Coconut Butter Cups  I’ve been on a coconut kick lately. Coconut milk in my smoothies.

It all starts with gorgeous pumpkin, which is peeled, seeded, and cubed into bite-size chunks. The flavor comes in waves thanks to ingredients likecurry paste, chili peppers, ginger, garlic, and shallot – a.k.a. the curry dream team.  For vegetables, I went with vibrant red bell pepper and broccoli. That’s all you really need! And to keep the curry creamy and rich, I opted for light coconut milk, which complements the spicy flavors perfectly.  For a healthy fat and EASY protein, I went with roasted cashews (something I always have on hand). But, if you aren’t into cashews or can’t do nuts, you could also add Quick Crispy Tofu, includeRed Lentils, or simply serve over quinoa.  I hope you all LOVE this curry!

0,Cinnamon Baked Apples | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Cinnamon Baked Apples  Apple season is officially here (!!) and I’ve been dreaming about this baked apple recipe for a while now. Dreams came true in my kitchen when I opened up the oven to see these tender, cinnamon-coated, perfectly caramelized apples! Let me show you how.  This recipe is simple, requiring 9 (basic) ingredients and 1 bowl. A mix of tart and sweet apples are peeled, cored, thinly sliced, and added right to the baking dish before being topped with delicious spices like cinnamon, fresh ginger, and nutmeg. Total swoon.  To keep this dish naturally sweetened, I went with coconut sugar (you could also sub stevia or maple syrup)! Coconut sugar provides a slightly caramelized flavor I adore. All that’s left is lemon juice and sea salt to balance out the sweetnessand a touch of cornstarch or arrowroot to ensure the sauce thickens up nicely. Forty-five minutes in the oven covered then another 10 uncovered and you’re in cinnamon-apple paradise.   I hope you all LOVE these baked apples!

0,Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Oil-Free Roasted Vegetables  I’ve been playing around with oil-free dishes for two reasons: 1) I’m curious to see if you can make dishes oil-free while maintaining delicious flavor and texture. And 2) many of you have been asking for oil-free recipes*, so I wanted to provide this as a resource! Spoiler alert: It totally works! Let me show you how.  This recipe requires simple ingredients (whatever seasonal vegetables you have available to you) and simple seasonings (whatever flavors make you happy). I’ve been loving this DIY curry powder, which added a complex kick of flavor to the vegetables I had on hand, which in this case were a mix of starchy and non-starchy vegetables. More on that soon…  Here’s the trick I’ve found to work best: Steam starchy vegetables first until just tender and then finish roasting in the oven. And for non-starchy vegetables, throw them straight into the oven with just the seasonings (no steaming necessary). They don’t need the extra moisture because they are more tender and have a higher water content in most instances, so steaming would make them soggy. So in this instance, I chose to steam the sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts. And then I added the broccolini, beets, cauliflower, peppers, cabbage, and zucchini straight into the oven to roast.  You’ll know that your vegetables are done when they’re tender and slightly golden brown on the outside. Or, if you like crispy vegetables, continue roasting until deeper golden brown (just be careful not to burn). And that’s it! Easy, oil-free roasted vegetables that are perfect for just about any occasion.  I hope you all LOVE these vegetables. They’re: Easy Quick Versatile Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Flavorful &amp; Delicious Add these vegetables to just about any dish to bring some plant-based goodness to your plate. Think breakfast scrambles, salads, quinoa bowls, pastas, wraps, and more! You can also pair these vegetables with my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese for a delicious crudité!

0,Coconut Curried Golden Lentils | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Curried Golden Lentils (20 Minutes!)  Sometimes you want to make a recipe so badly that you dream about it. This is one of those recipes. It may be their vibrant golden color, but I just couldn’t wait to cook up these lentils and put them on every bowl and salad from here to eternity. And oh my did they deliver. Let’s do this!  This dish comes together in about 20 minutes from start to finish, thanks to the quick cooking time of yellow lentils (which I’ve found to be very similar in texture and cooking time to red lentils). While you give your lentils a quick boil, prepare a coconut curry sauce with spices, ginger, garlic, and a healthy dose of coconut milk (check out my DIY Coconut Milk recipe).  Once the sauce is seasoned, add your lentils and stir. Finish with a bit more seasonings and some fresh lemon juice and “POW” – you have beautiful curried golden lentils!  Friends, I hope you LOVE these lentils. They’re: Savory Saucy Perfectly spiced Aromatic Coconutty Hearty + Satisfying &amp; Seriously delicious These curried lentils would be delicious atop rice, cauliflower rice, salads, bowls, and more.

0,5-Ingredient Vegan Almond Ricotta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whipped Almond Ricotta (5 Ingredients!)  I never thought vegan ricotta cheese could taste so good – until now. Friends, let’s make 5-ingredient vegan cheese!  The base for this seriously easy1-blender, 10-minutericotta is blanched slivered almonds. Because they’ve already been soaked and the skins removed, the almonds don’t need to be soakedbefore blending! Time = saved. In fact, I tried soaking them and didn’t like the end product nearly as much. Because ricotta doesn’t typically have an intense cheesy flavor, the only additions it needs are nutritional yeast for a little cheesiness, lemon juice for tang, salt for saltiness, and a dash of garlic powder for depth of flavor.  Once blended, the “ricotta” is ready to go! Or you can set it in a cheesecloth and set it in the refrigerator to chill and harden a bit more. But if you’re in a hurry, the finished product is ready like that (in just 10 minutes)!  I hope you all LOVE this almond ricotta! It’s: Creamy Tangy Cheesy Satisfying Versatile Easy to make &amp; SO delicious Add this ricotta to things like my Zucchini Lasagna, My Favorite Vegan Pizza, or Stuffed Shells! It would also make a delicious addition to things like my Lentil Bolognese Sauce to make the sauce creamier and cheesier. YUM.

The dense, little snack bites are inspired by Lee from America’s Coconut Fat Balls, which I tried recently and really enjoyed.

The result is amazing – the perfect snack or healthier dessert I’ve been craving recently.

Arrowroot powder adds thickness and helps the sauce get a bit “stringy” like real cheese!   I hope you all enjoy this aflredo sauce!

Let’s do this!  First of all, what is a tonic? Good question! It’sa ‘medicinal substance taken to give a feeling of vigor or well-being.’ (source) I used to think of “tonic” as tonic water. But when I realized that it related more to a healing beverage or substance, I’ve been calling this recipe a “tonic” ever since! This turmeric-ginger-lemon variety has been on repeat for some time now, so it was due time I share it with you all. It’s easy to make, requiring just 5 minutes, 3 ingredients, and 1 pot. Healthy and easy? Yeah, now we’re talking.  The base for this easy tonic is lemon juice, freshly grated ginger, and freshly grated turmeric. You can elect to add maple syrup, but I didn’t find it necessary! The only other thing I prefer is a little kick in the form of cayenne pepper.  So what makes this tonic healing? Good question. Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which boasts amazing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. (source) Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory andantioxidant thathas been known toaid digestion and relieve nausea. (source) Lemon is naturally detoxifying and alkalizing in the body, aids in healthy bowel movements, and boasts plenty of Vitamin C, which boosts the immune system. (source) And cayenne stimulates circulation, boosts metabolism, naturally relieves pain, and can have an alkalizing effect in the body. (source) See? Told ya so.  I hope you all LOVE this tonic!

The base is a blend of flax eggs, coconut oil, zucchini, and applesauce, while maple syrup and coconut sugar add the perfect amount of natural sweetness. Then comes plenty of cocoa powder for that rich chocolate flavor.  For gluten-free flours, I tested many combinations, but a mixture of oat flour, gluten-free flour, and almond flour worked best!

0,Easy Vegan Poutine | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Poutine  After many requests for vegan poutine, it’s finally here! Without further ado, let’s jump into it! This recipe requires 10 ingredients and about 1 hour to prepare (once your cheese is made!). The base, of course, is crispy baked fries! I discovered that cooking the fries in a bit of oil on parchment paper allowed them to get crispy on the outside and tender on the inside without ever sticking to the pan.  While your fries cook, it’s gravy time. For my gravy, I went with a mix of mushroom and shallot for flavor and heartiness, cornstarch or arrowroot to thicken, almond milk and vegetable stock to thin and add more flavor, and plenty of salt, pepper, and a dash of vinegar and coconut aminos to bring more depth of flavor. I did a lot of testing and research when it came to gravy, and this by far was my favorite! I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.  All that’s left to do is add cheese, brown in the oven, and top with gravy! Traditional poutine doesn’t require the cheese curd to be cooked, but my version isn’t traditional – it’s vegan, after all. Plus, the Vegan Mozzarella Cheese “curds” taste best when they’ve got a little a little color on them! And who wouldn’t want melty, gooey cheese on their fries?  I hope you all LOVE these fries! They’re: Hearty Salty Cheese Gravy-covered Savory Luscious &amp; SO Satisfying This is the perfect dish to enjoy on game days, on chilly fall and winter evenings, or when you’re craving a hearty appetizer or snack.

0,Vegan Mozzarella Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Mozzarella “Cheese”  It’s cheese! It’s cheese! And it’s seriously easy to make! Shall we?  This is my take on vegan “mozzarella cheese.” There are quite a few methods out there to try, but to me, this is about as easy (and delicious) as it gets, requiring just 7 ingredients and simple methods to create. The base for this “cheese” is soaked cashews. They get wonderfully creamy when soaked and create a neutral flavor base that takes on the tanginess of coconut yogurt, lemon, and nutritional yeast so well.  Once blended, all you have to do is cook on the stovetop for about 5-10 minutes, first whisking and then stirring until you get a thick, sticky cheese ball!  At this point, the cheese is ready to use. But to add a bit more flavor to the mozz, you can soak it in a sea salt water brine. I personally thought this was a fun approach, but ultimately, I felt that it added too much moisture to my cheese, so in the instructions, I recommend skipping. But you can see the process photographed below.  What is this cheese good for? SO MANY THINGS. I loved it on top of pizza, as it got all melty, browned, and gooey. But you could also add it to tomatoes, pesto sandwiches, pasta dishes like baked lasagna, Caprese salads, and so much more!  I hope you all LOVE this recipe!

0,Traditional White Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Traditional White Sangria  Friends! Summer is almost over here in the Pacific Northwest, but I’m still hanging on to every last drop of sunshine with this Traditional White Wine Sangria. Gather your leftover berries and stone fruit, snag an apple and some wine, and let’s make sangria!  I shared a recipe for Easy Traditional Red Sangria, and you all have loved that! It’s our go-to for hosting and one we enjoy over and over again. So it was due time to create a white wine version. This recipe is simple, requiring just 8 ingredients, 1 pitcher, and 15 minutes to make. The only “special” ingredients it requires are a bottle of white Spanish table wine and apple brandy (brand recommendations included below!). Based on my research, this is a traditional blend of alcohol and wine that creates a crisp but boozy and irresistible sangria.  For fruit, I went with plenty of citrus, strawberry, nectarine, and apple. Of course, based on whatever season it is in your country, get creative! Anything that blends well with beverages would likely work here (think oranges, blackberries, figs, plums, and mango). Sangria benefits from a bit of sweetness, and to keep things uncomplicated and pure in flavor, I went with organic cane sugar. But I know some of you avoid sugar, so try sweetening with a comparable amount of either powdered coconut sugar, maple syrup, agave, or stevia to taste.  All that’s left to do is muddle and then add the rest of the fruit and booze! This is the fun part.  Simply stir and serve over ice or frozen fruit. This can be made up to 24 hours in advance, which makes it ideal for making ahead for parties and gatherings.  I hope you all LOVE this sangria! It’s: Citrusy Bright Fruity Perfectly sweet Refreshing Versatile &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect easy beverage for Spanish-inspired mealsor tapas dishes like Patatas Bravas (mmmm, take me back to Spain already). Pair this delicious sangria with just about anything spicy or Spanish/Mexican-inspired, like Quinoa &amp; Vegetable Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms, Roasted Cauliflower Tacos with Chipotle Romesco, Garlicky Sweet Potato Noodle Pasta, Quinoa Taco Meat, or Butternut Squash Portobello Tacos!

0,Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower Steak | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Shawarma Roasted Cauliflower “Steak”  I’ve been wanting to share a cauliflower steak for the longest time, and my beloved version is finally here! If you’ve never had cauliflower “steak,” it’s exactly what it sounds like: cauliflower sliced lengthwise into “steaks,” seasoned, and either grilled or roasted (I went for roasted) until tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Swoon!  My take is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to prepare, which includes my go-to green chutney sauce! For seasoning the cauliflower, I went with my DIY Shawarma Spice Blend, which creates a smoky, subtly spicy coating that pairs perfectly with the chutney.  The end result is PERFECT! It’s: Smoky Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Served with a citrusy, herby sauce Hearty Satisfying &amp; Incredibly healthy! I love this either as a hearty side or served atop a bed of quinoa for more protein (see recipe + notes for more options!)!

The crust is made of dates, walnuts, and salt, which creates a salty-sweet, insanely delicious base for this creamy cheesecake.  The matcha comes in swirl form. Once most of the filling has been added, add a bit of matcha to the remaining filling and blend. Then pour and swirl. Ohhhh, yeah. It’s not only beautiful, but also delicious.

0,Sweet Potato Cauliflower Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Cauliflower Curry (30 Minutes!)  It’s time for another easy, plant-based meal that’s flavorful, healthy, and super delicious. Let’s do this!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare! And it’s inspired by an Indian dish called aloo gobi, which typically consists of curried cauliflower and potatoes. While it can be served on its own, I prefer this more saucy inspired version*. Serious yum. In place of regular potatoes I went with sweet because sweet potato’s flavor lends itself so well to curry! And instead of cooking the cauliflower with the sweet potatoes, I roasted them with sea salt and curry powder until crispy and golden brown. I find roasted cauliflower to have so much more flavor and such better texture than stewed. Plus, once roasted, it acts as the “rice” in this dish to soak up all of that delicious curry sauce.  For serving, you don’t need much more than some fresh cilantro and lemon juice! This curry also pairs well with my Vegan Naan if you’re looking for even more heartiness. Or just some classic rice or cauliflower rice would be delicious, too!  I hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s: Flavorful Hearty Vegetable-packed Comforting Satisfying &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something fresh and hearty on the table fast! It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair well with this Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri, Curry Roasted Vegetable and Lentil Kale Salad, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Curried Butternut Squash Soup, andCurry-Spiced Cashews. If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!  *Update: Some readers commented that aloo gobi traditionally does not include tomatoes or curry paste, which was a new-to-me idea! I based this recipe off a version I tried in an Indian restaurant that did include tomatoes and tasted very similar to this dish. This is definitely an inspired version! I tend to keep curry paste on hand, which is why I recommended using it in this recipe. However, to keep it more traditional you can instead season with spices (such as turmeric and garam masala) and fresh chilies. ",https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-cauliflower-curry-30-minutes/
0,Gingery Mango Berry Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gingery Mango &amp; Berry Smoothie  Most of our smoothie recipes have bananas, and some of you happen to dislike bananas. (Weird, I know – some of my friends and family included!) So, when I recently ran out of bananas but was still craving a smoothie, I discovered this recipe, which would be perfect for those of you who aren’t in love with bananas but still want a delicious, creamy smoothie. Let’s do this!  This recipe requires just 6 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes– simple, just the way I like it. Instead of bananas for a creamy, sweet base, I relied on another favorite: mango! And for a gorgeous pink hue and dose of antioxidants, I added in a mixture of strawberries and raspberries. Frozen fruit makes the creamiest, dreamiest smoothies. But if yours is fresh, simply add 1-2 cups of ice to chill things down. Next up are lime for some acidity, ginger for a bit of spice, coconut milk and shredded coconut for a bit of coconut flavor, and a pinch of cayenne to bring a bit of heat (optional but recommended!).  Mmm, look at that creamy goodness. All that’s left to do is enjoy as is or layer and garnish with delicious toppings! I went for my Easy 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt, but full-fat coconut milk works wonders as well for that sultry swirl effect. And on top, I went with more raspberries, a bit of lime, and a spoonful of coconut flakes. Yes, please. I hope you all LOVE this smoothie! It’s: Creamy Citrusy Naturally sweet Gingery + subtly spicy Nutrient-packed Healthy &amp; SO delicious This would make the perfect on-the-go smoothiein the mornings or even a post-workout snack if you add in a little of your favorite protein powder.

0,Gluten-Free Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies  Hey, friends! How’s it going? Things are swimming along over here. Summer is in full bloom (my fave), we’ve been traveling a lot, and I’ve been enjoying being in the kitchen even more than usual lately for some weird but wonderful reason. Maybe it’s because I’ve been whipping up delicious eats like these healthier oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Let’s bake!  The base for this simple, 10-ingredient recipe is oats, almond flour (or meal), and shredded coconut. Coconut oil adds moisture and crispness, while almond butter adds nuttiness and helps create a tender center. Lastly, they’re sweetened with muscovado sugar (or coconut or brown sugar) and studded with vegan dark chocolate chips. Swoon.  The binder is aquafaba (method adapted from these Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies!), which helps the cookies puff up and crisp on the edges. Is there anything aquafaba can’t do? I think not.  Just 12-15 minutes in the oven and these babies are ready to go. You can make the dough ahead of time and chill overnight or even scoop out and freeze for future late-night cookie cravings (raise your hand if this happens to you way too often).  I hope you all LOVE cookies! They’re: Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Packed with oats Studded with chocolate Healthier than your average cookie &amp; SO delicious These would make the perfect cookie to have around to snack on throughout the week. If I were you, I’d throw them (already baked) into the freezer to have a cold, crunchy cookie when your sweet tooth craving strikes. (Trust me, I’m an expert – frozen cookies are where it’s at). If you’re into cookies, be sure to check out our 5-Ingredient Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, Almond Butter No-Bake Cookies, Coconut No-Bake Cookies, Soft &amp; Chewy Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Vegan GF Peanut Butter Cup Cookies.

0,Quinoa & Vegetable Stuffed Mushrooms | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa &amp; Vegetable Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms  It’s stuffed mushroom time! This summer-friendly recipe is yet another grill-friendly meal that’s portable, versatile, and super delicious.  It’s not only tasty, it’s also easy to make, requiring just 30 minutes and simple methods. The base is hearty portobello mushrooms in a balsamic-lime marinade seasoned with smoky spices. You can cook them eitherin the oven or on the grill, which makes them great for taking along to BBQs and dinner parties alike.  The “stuffing” is comprised of cooked quinoa, black beans, sweet potatoes, bell pepper, and cabbage seasoned with salt, lime, and smoky spices. Once your mushrooms have marinated and been sautéed, they’re ready for the stuffing! Party time.   While your mushrooms finish in the oven or on the grill, you can prepare a sauce of choice, such as Easy Red Salsa, Easy Chimichurri Sauce, or Chipotle Red Salsa. This is optional, but it takes the recipe to the next level! I personally prefer the chimichurri for its vibrant color and big flavor. It complements the dish perfectly.  I hope you guys love this dish! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Satisfying Healthy Versatile BBQ-friendly &amp; SO delicious This would make the perfect plant-based entrée for dinner parties and BBQs! I think it would satisfy vegans and non-vegans alike, and it can be customized to be grain-free andinclude several different sauces (options below).

0,Best Vegan Matcha Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Best Vegan Matcha Latte  Matcha lattes, you guys. Vegan matcha lattes. Naturally sweetened vegan matcha lattes. Things are getting very hipster over here today and I’m very into it. Let’s matcha!  I’ve been on and off the caffeine train many times over the last decade. Some days, it’s my superpower. Other days, it makes me feel like an insane person. So when I’m needing a little pick-me-up these days, I’ve been opting for a gentler source of caffeine that also boasts a flurry of antioxidants: matcha green tea powder!  This 4-ingredient, 5-minute recipe is easy to make, customizable, and super delicious. The first and most important thing is to start with quality matcha. Townshend’s is local to Portland and I love supporting local brands doing cool things, so I went with Townshend’s this time (which happens to be bright green and so delicious!). However, if you’re new to matcha and wanting to try a more affordable yet still high-quality brand, tryOrganic Matcha (which I also enjoyed).  For sweetener, I went with maple syrup, but another natural alternative would be stevia, which dissolves easily and adds a subtle amount of sweetness to your latte. The next important ingredient is dairy-free milk. I tested almond, coconut, and macadamia nut milk, and two stood out as clear winners. Almond milk doesn’t jive with the flavor of matcha in my opinion, but coconut and macadamia, on the other hand, totally do. I found my favorite combo to be half coconut milk, half macadamia milk (brand recommendations below // see my Guide to Making Dairy-Free Milks here!). This duo creates a creamy, delicious latte that lets the matcha shine through.  I hope you guys enjoy this latte! It’s: Creamy Smooth Bright green Naturally sweetened Antioxidant-rich &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect gentle caffeine boost when you need a little pick-me-up. I enjoy mine warm in the morning with breakfast. But it can also be made cold over ice if you’re in warmer climates or it’s summertime. If you’re into caffeine boosts, also be sure to check out our Cold Brew Mocha Frappuccino, Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino, Coffee Coconut Ice Cream, Vegan Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches, Vegan Pumpkin Spice Latte Waffles, 3-Ingredient Mocha Milkshake, and Matcha Green Smoothie Bowls.

0,Roasted Rainbow Vegetable Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Rainbow Vegetable Bowl (30 Minutes!)  I shared on Instagram stories recently about a meal I’ve been super into that has a surprising amount of protein despite it being basically 100% vegetables. Yeah, vegetables are cool like that, bro. Let me show you how!  This 30-minute vegetable bowl is inspired by farmers market produce and the beautiful CSA we’ve been getting this year! I’ve found myself in an abundance of vegetables and loving it – but not always knowing what to do with them. My easy solution? Roasting. Roasting vegetables makes them easier to digest, enhances their flavor, and takes them to whole new level of delicious. So we start with carrots, beets, radish, potatoes, and sweet potatoes all tossed in sea salt, oil (or water), and curry powder.  Once the root vegetables are 10 minutes in, throw in some cabbage, bell pepper, broccolini, and, last but not least, some greens! And just like that, you have a meal.  So where does the protein come from? Plants! Vegetables have plenty of protein (and other healthy stuff like fiber, vitamins, and minerals). For instance, did you know 1 potato has 4.3 grams protein, 1 cup kale has nearly 3 grams protein, and 1 cup broccoli has 2.6 grams protein? And fun fact:1 head cauliflower has 11 grams protein! Kinda cool, right? Throw on some hemp seeds and tahini and your meal boasts 13.2 grams protein! Don’t get me wrong – it’s not all about protein. There are many studies that suggest average protein consumption is usually too high. But people often wonder where plant-based eaters get their protein. And I personally love knowing I’m getting plenty just from simple plant sources.  I hope you all LOVE this bowl! It’s: Wholesome Satisfying Colorful Flavorful Healthy Versatile &amp; SO delicious This would make the perfect healthy plant-based breakfast, lunch, or dinner! I’ve been loving mine as a late morning brunch alongside a little Golden Milk or lemon water. If you aren’t into tahini, try my Easy 10-Minute Chimichurri Sauceor Garlic Dill Sauce!

The result is a smoky, tangy, spicy, well-balanced sauce that’s thick and creamy and perfect for these cauliflower tacos.  I hope you all LOVE these tacos! They’re: Smoky Spicy Savory Satisfying Easy to make Versatile &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect healthy, satisfying weeknight meal when you don’t have much time to cook. The cauliflower could be roasted ahead of time and reheated in the oven or stovetop if you’re short on time.

I’ve only shared a few veggie noodle pastas on the blog (Carrot Noodle Chickpea Bolognese,Zucchini Pasta with Lentil Sauce and Noodle-Free Pad Thai). But, because it’s summer and I’ve found myself in an abundance of zucchini and potatoes, it seemed like the right time to share another “pasta-free” pasta dish!  This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 8 ingredientsand simple methods to prepare. The base is spiralized sweet potato noodles, which cook up quickly until tender and provide the perfect amount of sweetness to offset the garlicky, cheesy cashew alfredo sauce. This garlicky alfredo sauce is on point! Cashews blend with garlic, nutritional yeast, salt, and almond milk. Arrowroot adds a little more thickness to the sauce but isn’t necessary. Yes, that’s it! So easy and so creamy, garlicky, and delicious. Look at that thickness though!  I hope you all LOVE this veggie noodle pasta. It’s: Garlicky Creamy Savory-sweet Satisfying Versatile &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something healthy but satisfying.

0,Peanut Butter & Jelly Açaí Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Açaí Bowls  On a recent trip to Kansas to visit friends and family, we stopped at a local juice shop called Songbird that had the delicious, healthy offerings I was craving when away from home. Are you surprised to know I went two days in a row? And that I ordered the same thing both days? I’m so predictable it’s not even funny. This was one of my first açaí bowl experiences, and the flavor combination of banana peanut butter finally compelled me to create an inspired version for the blog. Let’s do this!  This recipe is SO simple, requiring just 10 minutes, 4 ingredients, and 1 blender. The base is açaí, the wonder fruit everyone seems to be raving about, especially when it comes to smoothie bowls. Açaí is a South American-based berry that’s becoming quite popular in the health community, boasting loads of antioxidants, amino acids, electrolytes, and vitamins. I personally love it because (depending on the brand you buy – I like Sambazon), it has very low sugar content. Plus, itblends extremely well with other ingredients as it’s quite neutral in flavor, which is what makes it perfect for this banana peanut butter version!  In addition to frozen açaí (which is easy to find at most grocery stores and health markets in the frozen section), I relied on bananas for creamy sweetness, peanut butter powder for a lower-calorie yet high-protein addition, coconut milk, and spinach (hello, fiber and folate). The result is a creamy, thick smoothie bowl that ends up tasting like a banana peanut butter milkshake!  For toppings, I went with sliced bananas, berries, coconut, and sunflower seeds. Hemp seeds also make a great addition. I also think this smoothie bowl would be delicious with the addition of your favorite vegan protein powder (chocolate, vanilla, or plain)!  I hope you all LOVE this smoothie bowl! It’s: Creamy Perfectly sweet Peanut buttery Nutritious Super healthy &amp; Mega delicious This would make the perfect breakfast or snack for days when you don’t have much time or it’s too hot to cook.

Spoiler alert: This is my new favorite Pad Thai recipe that trumps takeout every time. It’s that good!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare! And LOOK at all those veggies! Noodle-free Pad Thai never looked so gorgeous and delicious. To replace traditional rice noodles, I went with carrot “noodles,” collard greens, thinly sliced bell pepper, and cabbage.

And let’s not forget the sauce, which I played around with quite a bit until perfecting: almond butter, lime juice, coconut aminos (or tamari / soy sauce), maple syrup, and chili flake. That’s it! So simple, savory, spicy, sweet, and insanely delicious.   For more “oomph,” I added a bit of crumbled tofu to mock the egg in traditional Pad Thai, but this is completely optional, especially if you’re soy-free.

0,5-Ingredient Vegan Parmesan Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Parmesan Cheese  Nuts can be “cheese,” too, ya know? I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. It was about time for my updated, go-to vegan parmesan cheeserecipe! Let’s do this.  What’s different about this new recipe and my old, go-to recipe? It’s cashew-free! Many of you have expressed cashew allergies/intolerances and I thought I’d provide an alternative. This version is as easy as ever, requiring just 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, and 1 bowl.  In place of cashews, I went for a blend of hemp seeds, pine nuts (which add a buttery, nutty flavor), and Brazil nuts (which are fairly neutral in flavor). The “cheese” flavor comes from nutritional yeast (which is super high in vitamin B12), and a pinch of salt. That’s it! Garlic powder and oil are optional, but they add even more depth of flavor.  I hope you all love this cashew-free vegan parmesan! It’s: Cheesy Savory Nutty Salty Easy to make Versatile &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect topper for things like Eggplant Parmesan, My Favorite Vegan Pizza, Roasted Red Pepper Pasta, or Easy Vegan Meatballs. It also works well in things like Pesto and Vegan Mac ‘n’ Cheese Sauces! If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram.

0,Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chimichurri  This is an entrée salad if I’ve ever seen one. And it’s what I’ve been noshing on lately for solo-lady dinners and lunches at home. It makes delicious use of seasonal vegetables, my favorite 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, and my 10-minute Chimichurri as a dressing! Wowza – that’s a gorgeous plate. Let’s make salad!  I’ve been digging roasted vegetables lately because they’re the easiest way to make vegetables tender, delicious,and easier to digest. And even with the roasting time, this remains a 30-minute recipe. Some of you ask how I work so fast in the kitchen. I suppose I’ve been doing it for a while now, but also, I multitask! While your veggies are roasting, make your dressing. It’s that easy! Lately, I’ve been throwing whatever roasted vegetables I have on a bed of greens and calling it a meal. Add a little tahini and lemon juice for “dressing.” Or, if you’re feeling fancy, bust out the chimichurri – my new favorite condiment for summer! Not only is it a gorgeous, vibrant green color, but it’s packed with healthy fats, spices, and an extra serving of greens from both parsley and cilantro. Hello, world’s healthiest dressing (cue waving hand emoji). I hope you guys LOVE this salad! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Veggie-packed Satisfying Super healthy Versatile &amp; Super delicious This would make the perfect meal for an easy at-home lunch or quick weeknight dinner. It travels well, so I could also see it being delicious on picnics, hikes, road trips, or even plane trips! It’s hearty enough to serve two as an entrée (20+ grams protein!). But it would also make a delicious side to meals like my Grillable Veggie Burgers, Zucchini Lasagna, Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich, or Red Lentil Chili.

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Carrot Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Carrot Cake  Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me… Happy birthday to me! Hey, guys. It’s my birthday and I made myself a cake, ’cause that’s how I do. The wait is over – let’s make cake!  This cake is simple, requiring just 1 bowl to make! Plus, it requires basic ingredients you likely have on hand right now. The recipe is adapted from my Vegan GF Carrot Apple Muffins, but it needed some tweaking to get that cake-like texture. I tested this recipe for 3 days straight (oy) until I finally ended up with this perfected version. I served it to friends (non-vegan and non-gluten-free folks) and none of them could tell that it was special-diet friendly. Score!  The base of the cake is coconut oil, applesauce, flax eggs, maple syrup, and almond milk. Organic brown sugar and cane sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness while leaving the cake light and fluffy. And for gluten-free flours, I went with almond flour and my go-to gluten-free blend. The result is a light, airy, fluffy carrot cake that retains its moisture without being mushy (the ultimate goal). Once cooled, it’s frosting time!   For frostings, I included several options. After taking a vote on Twitter, it seemed many of you wanted to see both a vegan buttercream and a cashew buttercream. But guess what? I provide6 frosting options below! For my cake, I went for classic Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting – I couldn’t resist. But really, any of the options would be amazing! Just depends on how creative and healthy you want to be.  I hope you all LOVE this carrot cake! It’s: Tender Fluffy Moist Perfectly sweet Carrot-packed &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect birthday cake or cake for summer celebrations, wedding showers, cookouts, and beyond! It’s insanely flavorful, rich, moist, and undetectably vegan and gluten-free. Those who are gluten-free will be happy to know there isn’t any oat flour in this cake. I also included nut-free, oil-free, and refined-sugar-free options in the notes. If you’re into cake (who’s not?), be sure to check out our other cakes: Vegan Birthday Cake, The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes, Vegan Chocolate Hazelnut Cake, Vegan Funfetti Cupcakes, Vegan Pumpkin Cake, Vegan Pumpkin Roll, Vegan Apple Gingerbread Cake, and Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake!

0,Cashew Buttercream Frosting | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cashew Buttercream Frosting (2 Ways!)  Friends! It’s frosting time because I have a cake coming your way soon that needs it BIG TIME. Shall we?  This frosting is not only simple –8 ingredients required – but it also comes with 2 flavor variations: “Classic” and “Tangy Cream Cheese.” The first is great for instances when you want a vegan buttercream for things like Funfetti Cupcakes, and the second is preferred for cakes that call for cream cheese frosting like Zucchini Cake! I know. It’s so exciting I can hardly stand it.  The base for these frostings is soaked cashews. For the classic, I go with coconut milk and lemon juice. And for the tangy, I go with coconut yogurt(!!) and apple cider vinegar, which provides that cream-cheese-like flavor. Both versions are naturally sweetened with maple syrup, and they get even more flavor from vanilla extract. The result is a creamy, dreamy cashew cream that chills perfectly into frosting texture!  Your cashew cream just needs some time in the freezer with occasional whisking and then blending to get that quintessential buttercream texture. The transformation is magical.  I hope you all LOVE this frosting! It’s: Thick Creamy Rich Decadent Naturally sweetened &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect frosting option for things like cupcakes, cakes, cookies, and more! I think it would be especially delicious on my Vegan Sugar Cookies, 1-Bowl Pumpkin Bread, and my Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,How to Make Coconut Yogurt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy 2-Ingredient Coconut Yogurt  Friends, I made yogurt! Coconut yogurt to be exact. And if I can make yogurt, you can make yogurt – promise. Let’s do this!  There areno fancy tricks or expensive equipment involved here. Just 2 simple ingredients required! All you need iscoconut milk and probiotic capsules, which (if you’re like me) you probably have in your pantry right now. Score! This is a 3-step process: 1) Empty coconut milk into a clean glass jar or bowl. 2) Top with probiotic and stir. 3) Cover with cheesecloth and wait. That’s it! Seriously – it doesn’t get any easier than this. And the result is phenomenal!   I’m sure you’re thinking, “How good can homemade yogurt be?” Trust me, I’ve tried all the store-bought coconut yogurts and this by far is the best! It’s creamy (almost like Greek yogurt!), rich, and tangy – just like the “real” thing.  Once your yogurt has activated (24-48 hours), simply refrigerate to thicken / cool and then enjoy! I prefer my yogurt plain, but it is also delicious with maple syrup, lemon, vanilla, or fruit. For serving, I made some of my fruit compote and added some chia seeds to thicken and WOW – it was amazing with the yogurt. Dream big, friends! Just about any flavor combination works here.  I hope you all LOVE this yogurt! It’s: Thick Creamy Coconutty Probiotic-rich Gut-healthy Versatile Easy to make &amp; SO delicious! This would make the perfect satisfying snack or breakfast. I like serving mine with some banana, fresh fruit, and a sprinkle of Classic Granola or Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Granola and hemp seeds for added protein and fiber! Talk about an amazing plant-based treat. This yogurt would also be delicious on top of things like my Life-Changing Banana Pancakes, Best Vegan GF Waffles, Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins, 1-Bowl Banana Bread, and more! And I put it to good use in upcoming recipes, so stay tuned! If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag your yogurt creations #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see. Cheers, friends!   Recipe updated 7/24/17 to reflect another round of testing and troubleshooting. Switched recommendation of light coconut milk to full fat! Other considerations:  Please make sure your probiotic is high quality and does not contain PREbiotics. The combination I have had the most success with: 1 can 365 Whole Foods Full Fat Coconut Milk + 2 Renew Life 50 billion probiotic capsules. I have not tested this recipe in a yogurt maker or with a yogurt starter/culture. So if you try them this way, let me know how it goes in the comments! It’s important that you follow the recommendations of coconut milk brands I mention, otherwise I can’t guarantee good results. I believe Whole Foods 365 brand works so well because the flavor and consistency are nearly perfect. It does contain guar gum, which may be why it helps create smooth texture and prevents separation. Brands that do not contain guar gum are more likely to have some separation. If you have separation, that’s OK! Either stir it in, or put it in the refrigerator separated, then scoop off the creamy top layer. If your yogurt takes on weird colors or odd smells, something has gone wrong. This never happened to me, but it can. If this happens, throw it out! It should taste tangy, but not spoiled. If you made this recipe with good results and you tried other brands / methods, please leave a rating and share any tips or tricks that might be useful to other readers! I have not tested this recipe with any other non-dairy milks and have no further recommendations besides full-fat coconut milk. Lastly, if you want to thicken your yogurt even more, place two layers of cheesecloth over a fine mesh strainer set over a large mixing bowl and carefully pour in your yogurt. Then loosely cover the top (with a lid or plastic wrap), and refrigerate / let drain for several hours (draining liquid as needed) until desired thickness is reached!

0,3-Ingredient Plantain Tortillas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Plantain Tortillas  While experimenting with plantain chips and garlicky guac (&lt;- a must-try recipe, btw), I had a few leftover plantains and was up for some experimenting. Per usual, the big, wide internet didn’t let me down. And, in fact, it led me to discover that, among the many things you can do with plantains, you can make TORTILLAS with them. I know! It’s crazy. It’s magic. It’s delicious. Let’s do this!  This recipe is so easy, requiring just 3 INGREDIENTS. Again, I know! It’s crazy! You start by boiling sliced green plantains for 15 minutes to soften and tenderize the fruit. Then you just peel, throw them into a blender or afood processor with salt, and blend until you have a sticky “dough.”  Next, to roll out, I went with tapioca flour to keep this recipe bothgluten-free and grain-free. You can also try smashing the tortillas between wax paper or plastic bags, but I found this to yield super sticky dough that was unmanageable – tapioca to the rescue!  All that’s left is a quick cook in a skillet (5-6 minutes total) and you have real-life tortillas on your hands! I know what you’re thinking – they are probably doughy in the middle and gross and not sturdy. But no! They cook all the way through, aren’t doughy in the slightest, and are SO sturdy I would bet money they’d hold more toppings than a traditional corn tortilla. Yeah, I said it.  I hope you LOVE these plantain tortillas! They’re: Easy to make Tender Customizable (add garlic or herbs!) Flexible + sturdy Neutral in flavor &amp; Super delicious These would make the perfect vessel for things like Vegan Barbacoa, Vegan “Pulled Pork,” Quinoa Taco Meat, Garlicky Guacamole, Roasted Jalapeño Vegan Queso, Saucy Portobello Mushrooms,and 10-Minute Chimichurri. I also bet they would work wonderfully for enchiladas (next on my list)! I also think, if baked, they would make a delicious tostada. Or, if sliced and then baked, they would make a delicious chip (see notes)! If you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistaker on Instagram so we can see your tortillas in action. Cheers, friends!

0,Mustard Green Cherry Salad & Tahini Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mustard Green Cherry Salad with Nut Cheese &amp; Tahini Dressing  Ah, welcome to my version of summertime eats. Produce, fruit, and plenty of quick heat-free meals, like this gem of a salad! It’s inspired by ourCSA box, which has been brimming with mustard greens – a new love of mine. Shall we?  I have been envisioning this salad ever since I discovered our macadamia nut cheese! I knew that it would meld perfectly with greens, cherries, and tahini dressing, and I was right! This salad requires 30 minutes (or less, depending on if you chill your nut “cheese”), 10 healthy ingredients, and no cooking! The base is mustard greens, which happen to be a favorite of mine this time of year. Mustard greens have the texture of a spinach-kale hybrid, but they taste like mustard! I know – it’s incredible. Plus, they’re super high in vitamins and minerals! Total win-win situation right here.  Next are my 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, toasted almonds, cherries, and my go-to, 3-ingredient tahini dressing! The combination strikes the perfect balance between creamy, savory, and sweet. It was love at first bite.  I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s: Creamy Fresh Nutty “Cheesy” Fruity Insanely satisfying &amp; Super healthy + delicious If you try this salad, let us know!

0,Baked Plantain Chips & Garlicky Guacamole | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Plantain Chips + Garlicky Guacamole  I’ve been on a plantain kick lately. Why, you ask?  They’re delicious They’re healthy They’re extremely versatile You can make CHIPS with them!  Need I say more?  This recipe is easy, requiring just 7 ingredients and 30 minutes! The base is thinly sliced green plantains tossed in a bit of coconut oil and salt and then baked to crispy perfection. The result is shockingly delicious and perfect for dipping in delicious things like GUACAMOLE. I know – it’s happening. Right now.   I have only posted a Greek Guacamole recipe before, so a more traditional version was necessary. My go-to guac is pretty basic: avocados, onion, lime, cilantro, and raw garlic for a zesty, spicy punch of flavor (throw in a jalapeño for more spice). Creamy, salty, citrusy, spicy – what more could you ask for?  I hope you all LOVE this version of chips + guac! It’s: Easy Quick Healthy Crunchy + creamy Grain-free Super flavorful &amp; So delicious This would make a delicious chip and dip for parties, BBQs, or just lazy days spent snacking.

0,1-Pot Vegan Barbacoa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Vegan “Barbacoa”  Friends, I’m so excited to share this recipe with you! What started as a “tempeh taco ‘meat'” experiment/flop turned into a major success. Without further ado, let’s make vegan “barbacoa!”  I was initially hoping to make tempeh taco meat. But because tempeh benefits from some sweetness in a marinade/sauce, I just couldn’t get the flavor right. So I pivoted and remembered how the mixture of carrots and lentils in my Best Vegan Pulled “Pork” Sandwich blew me away. I decided to try to morph that recipeinto vegan “barbacoa.” Total win! The base of this 1-pot recipe is onion, garlic, shredded carrots, and cooked lentils (I used canned to save time). The smokiness comes from ground smoked paprika, cumin, and cloves. And the heat comes from chipotle peppers in adobo sauce – a favorite ingredient for adding smoky, earthy spice. To balance the spice and smokiness, I added some coconut sugar for sweetness, lime juice and apple cider vinegar for acidity, and coconut aminos for that “umami” flavor. Then I let it simmer to deepen in color and flavor until it was tender, delectable, and insanely flavorful. Like whoa.   I hope you guys LOVE this “barbacoa!” It’s: Tender Smoky Flavorful Spicy Hearty Satisfying Easy to make &amp; Super delicious This would make the perfect topping for dishes like tacos, taco salads, nachos, and more! And I think it would be insanely delicious inside enchiladas (added to my recipe list!) and taquitos (find a version in our cookbook!). This barbacoa is delicious on its own, but it would also pair extremely well with things like my 5-Ingredient Ginger Beer Margaritas, 10-Minute Chimichurri Sauce, Mexican Quinoa Salad, Kale Chip Nachos, Vegan Mexican 7-Layer Dip, and Grilled Corn with Sriracha Aioli.

If you’ve never had romaine taco boats, you haven’t lived! OK, maybe you’ve lived, but you haven’t enjoyed the freshest, most satisfying dinner I know. Let’s make “Raw-maine” tacos!  This recipe is simple, with just 10 ingredients, 15 minutes, and no cooking required! Romaine leaves replace traditional taco shells for a crunchy, nutritious vessel that’s perfect for all the goodness that’s to come. I went for beet hummus! But to keep these raw, you could either skip the hummus or find (or make) a sprouted hummus.  Next comes fresh veggies of just about every color for a seriously crunchy, nutritious, and colorful filling. Hemp seeds are optional, but they add even more protein and health perks. And last but not least, the sauce! You could go either savory with my 10-Minute Chimichurrior tangy and sweet with my 4-ingredient tahini dressing (recipe below). Personally, I prefer the tahini dressing. But you can’t go wrong either way!  I hope you LOVE these taco boats! They’re: Fresh Flavorful Healthy Satisfying Versatile Easy &amp; Delicious! This would make a delicious entrée for two or a side or appetizer for four! While delicious on their own, they would pair well with Easy Vegan Falalel, Creamy Roasted Red Pepper + Tomato Soup, Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowls, 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese + Vegan Crudité, or Sun-Dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers!

This is the perfect “dessert for a meal” type of recipe (if you’re into that sort of thing – I certainly am).  And for the savory version, I went with my beloved combo of avocado, nutritional yeast, sea salt, and red pepper flake. I also added hemp seeds for more healthy fats, fiber, and protein.

0,Sweet Potato Salad With Avocado | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato &amp; Avocado Green Salad  On a recent trip to Kansas for a friend’s wedding, I came to the realization that airplane food is just never going to do it for me. There are rarely any good vegetarian options that aren’t slathered in five kinds of cheese, and there’s hardly ever a fresh vegetable in sight. OK, rant over. The solution? Bring your own lunch! And so I did. This recipe is inspired by my simple airplane salad that requires just 30 minutes to make, and it’s insanely healthy and delicious. Let’s do it!  The base of this salad is organic spinach and mizuna lettuce from ourorganic CSA! However, you can use whatever greens you have on hand. I think kale and green lettuce would also work well. Next comes sweet potatoes that are roasted until tender and golden brown, as well as a ripe avocado for plenty of plant-based fiber and healthy fat. Lastly? The dressing! It’s all about the dressing, which is my go-to3-ingredient lemon-maple tahini dressing! It’s creamy, citrusy, and subtly sweet, and it complements this salad perfectly.  That’s really it! It’s light and refreshing yet satisfying. For added protein, I sprinkled on a healthy dose of hemp seeds, which are a “perfect protein” and contain all 20 amino acids(among other amazing health benefits). Can we say superfood much? However, you can also add something like crispy baked chickpeas for added protein and fiber.  I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s: Simple Quick Fresh Healthy Satisfying &amp; Crazy delicious This makes a perfect portable lunch, as it can be served chilled or at room temperature (making it ideal for long flights!). It’s delicious on its own and serves one as an entrée (with 22+ g protein!).

Because many of you are gluten-free and some grain-free, I decided to tackle a crisp that was completely grain-free! However, if you have a nut allergy, you can easily substitute oats or even coconut. This is a very flexible recipe that also happens to be insanely delicious.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl to prepare. The berries are added directly to a baking dish then topped with maple syrup, arrowroot starch (to help thicken the berry juice), and lemon juice for a bit of brightness and acidity.  Next comes the crisp, which is kept grain-free with a mixture of almond flour, shredded coconut, and chopped pecans. It’s also naturally sweetened with coconut sugar (!!), which keeps this recipe refined-sugar-free! Just 40-45 minutes in the oven and this beauty is ready to enjoy. It gets crisp and golden brown on top, and the juices from the berries meddle and create a lovely “sauce.” Oh, mama.   I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s: Easy to make Berry-packed Naturally sweetened Warm + comforting Crisp on top &amp; Entirely delicious This would make the perfect summertime dessert for dinner parties, BBQs, and celebrations or an easy weeknight treat.

0,How to Make Nut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How To Make Nut Butter Consider this your one-stop resource for how to make nut butter at home! It’s so easy, often requires just 1 (or 2) ingredients, and comes together in less than 30 minutes!  First, choose your base. I love starting with raw, organic almonds. Then I mix in a few walnuts for omega-3s. However, hazelnuts make a delicious butter on their own, as do pecans. So many nuts to choose from! Or, go for seeds! Sunflower seeds make amazing butter, too. I include links to several recipes below.   Hazelnuts have skins, which often shed during roasting. So it’s best to remove those before blending (see photo below).  Then, it’s nut butter time! Either use a food processor or high-speed blender to creamy a creamy, delicious nut butter. Just 1 ingredient – that’s right! No oil, water, or sweetener. In fact, adding in ingredients like oil, water, or even maple syrup tend to disrupt the creamy texture and shouldn’t be added. The blending processgenerally takes 10-12 minutes, so be patient! It’s worth the wait.  While your nut butter is blending, you can choose a few add-ins (if desired). My go-tos are sea salt and flax seed. But you could also add hemp seed, chia seed, coconut butter, a dash of vanilla, or even dark chocolate! Dark chocolate + hazelnuts = NUTELLA. I know! It’s amazing.  That’s it! You nut butter made at home. It’s that easy. Plus, making your own nut butter allows you to create your own blends, add fun mix-ins, control salt content, AND save money! So awesome. See my favorite nut butter recipes below in the recipe. If you try making nut butter, let us know how it goes!

0,How to Make Coconut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Coconut Butter  Have you ever wanted to make your own coconut butter but didn’t know how? This is the recipe for you. Bonus? Itrequires just1 bowl, 1 ingredient, and 10 minutes. Shall we?  The 1 ingredient is shredded unsweetened coconut. I find that using desiccated coconut (buying options included below) works best. But I speculate you could also use any unsweetened shredded coconut you can find. The next important part is equipment! I highly recommend using a food processoras the design of blenders isn’t conducive to blending coconut butter. It tends to kick up the flakes and not allow them to blend, which is how it gets creamy. So stick with a food processor for best results. Then, it’s just blend, blend, blend until you have creamy, delicious coconut butter on your hands!    Coconut butter is: Unsweetened Wholesome Creamy Rich Super coconutty Delicious &amp; So easy to make It’s perfect for snacking on straight out of the jar, but also pairs well with things like baked sweet potatoes, ice cream, smoothies, muffins, banana bread, waffles, pancakes, and more!

The structure and the makeup of this magical brine allow it to be whipped into things like meringue andmayonnaiseand used as a fluffy egg substitute in things like donuts, cakes, and cookies! In this recipe, the aquafaba is whipped into semi-stiff peaks. Then you simply add a little salt, vanilla, coconut oil, and maple syrup – which keeps this recipe naturally sweetened!  All that’s left to do is stir your maple-sweetened coconut into your aquafaba base, scoop, and bake. The dough should be wet but scoopable. This is key! If it’s too dry, the macaroons will be crumbly. If it’s too wet, they won’t fluff up in the oven. I include some tips in the instructions to help you achieve the right texture.  The name of the baking game here is slow and low. I bake these for 20 minutes at 325 degrees F (162 C) and then 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F (176 C). This allows the macaroons to firm up, and the higher temperature adds a beautiful golden-brown exterior. YUM. You can enjoy these macaroons as is or create a quick, 2-ingredient chocolate coating to dip and drizzle them with. This is completely optional, but it takes them to the next level for sure!  I hope you all LOVE these macaroons! They’re: Fluffy Crisp on the outside Tender on the inside Coconutty Perfectly sweet Easy to make &amp; Insanely delicious These would make the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand during the week or for road trips and picnics. They’re extremely portable, which makes them ideal gifts or treats to bring along to baby showers, bridal showers, BBQs, and more.

0,Blueberry Sweet Potato Breakfast Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Savory Breakfast Salad  During a recent trip to wine country,we stayed at one of our favorite hotels and I was so delighted to see a “breakfast salad” option on their morning menu. Salad &gt; donuts almost any day (unless it’s Sunday). You better believe I ordered it all threedays (with my own modifications) and loved every bite. The minute we got home and picked up our first CSA of the year (!!), I got to work recreating my own version of the salad with beautiful greens and organic produce. I can’t wait to share this gorgeous salad with you. Shall we?  The base of this 20-minute, 9-ingredient salad is a bed of greens. I went with organic mustard greens (!) and endive. However, you can really use whatever you have on hand. Next is sweet (or baby red) potatoes cooked to perfection on the stovetop, as well as blueberries and avocado for plenty of antioxidants, healthy fats, and plant-based fiber. For a bit of protein, I went with hummus and hemp seeds – a lovely combination that pairs well with just about any salad. For dressing, I kept things simple with a basic lemon vinaigrette. But you could easily sub in balsamic vinegar if that’s more your style or even just a drizzle of maple syrup, lemon, and tahini (like in my Detox Salad!).   I hope you all LOVE this summer-friendly salad! It’s: Fresh Light Satisfying Superfood-packed Colorful Delicious &amp; So easy to make This would make the perfect weekday or weekend breakfast when you have a bit of time to spare but don’t want to turn the oven on – which makes it summer (and warm-weather) friendly and perfect for using up seasonal produce from farmers markets and CSAs!

Well, then you won’t be surprised that I’m sharing a recipe for chocolate granola! Besides, who doesn’t want a(healthier) version of Cocoa Puffs in their life?  This chocolate granola is inspired by one I tried recently by Purely Elizabeth. I demolished the whole bag in a matter of days and knew I wanted to create a version for the blog. This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and roughly 30 minutes to make! The base is nuts, oats, chia seeds, and coconut. To keep things on the healthy side, I went with maple syrup and coconut sugar for natural sweetness. And the chocolate flavor comes from both cocoa powder and vegan dark chocolate! Yessss, come to Mama.  I hope you all LOVE this chocolate granola! It’s: Crunchy Nutty Chocolate-infused Perfectly sweet Protein- + Fiber-rich Quick + easy to make &amp; Delicious!

0,Easy Red Salsa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Red Salsa  How have Igotten 5 years into writing a food blog and not provided a simple red salsa recipe? How dare I? How could I? I know. Shame, shame. But I realized this recently and am excited to fill the void with this EASY, 10-minute Red Tomato Salsa! Let’s do it!  I did quite a bit of experimenting for this 10-minute, 8-ingredient, 1- bowl recipe. The dreamy minimalist in me thought, “Cool. I’ll just throw some tomatoes and onion and a pepper in a blender and ‘voila!’ I’ll have salsa!” Not quite.  While you can go that route, I find that it yields a watery, flavorless salsa, and I’m obviously not down for that. So, instead, I tested multiple canned-tomato varieties as a base and found fire-roasted tomatoes to be the best fit! They’re extremely smoky and complex, and they add a rich tomato flavor to this salsa. Supporting ingredients like onion, cilantro, lime, garlic, and jalapeño or serrano pepper round the flavors out to yield the perfect red salsa.  I hope you all LOVE this salsa! It’s: Fresh Flavorful Smoky Spicy Quick + Easy &amp; Delicious This is the perfect salsa for dipping tortilla chips, Frito chips, or even kale chips! It would also make a delicious addition to things like our Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups, Black Bean Butternut Squash Enchiladas, Best Damn Vegan Nachos, Sweet Potato Kale Chip Nachos, or Plantain Black Bean Tacos.

0,Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies  On a recent trip to California, I trieda chocolate chip cookie like no other chocolate chip cookie. It was healthy (like seriously healthy). It was delicious. It was chocolaty It was perfect. I got straight tothe kitchen when we got home. The code had to be cracked!  These almond butter cookies are insanely delicious, require just 1 bowland9 ingredients, and come together in 1 hour. And although they aren’t exactly like the cookie I tried, this inspired version is legit. This recipeis slightly adapted from my Best Almond Meal Chocolate Chip Cookies, but they are more tender and less involved (no whipping required). The base is coconut oil, coconut sugar, almond butter, and aquafaba! And the “flours” are almond flour and shredded coconut. This creates a light and fluffy cookie infused with almond flavor and studded with chocolate chips! And because many of you are doing less oil in your diet, I included a lower-oil option in the notes! I got you.   I hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re: Tender Fluffy Grain-free Chocolaty Perfectly sweet Easy to make &amp; Super delicious These would make the perfect healthier cookie to snack on throughout the week or to bring to BBQs and parties.

0,Macadamia Nut Cheese and Vegan Crudité | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Macadamia Cheese + Vegan Crudité!  I asked you allon Twitterrecently what kindsof recipes you wanted to see this month and many of you requestedroom-temperature meals that didn’t require much heat and were portable for picnics, BBQs, and dinner parties. I like the way you think! And I have asolution. Let’s do this!  The star of this (30-minute) vegan crudité is my 5-minute Macadamia Nut Cheese! Yes, 5 minutes. Unlike most other nuts, macadamia nuts don’t require soaking because they’re already so tender and soft. They blend up beautifully with just thehelp of a littlewater. Inspired by my Macadamia Ricotta, the cheesy flavor in this recipe comes from nutritional yeast, which is a vibrant yellow yeast that’s packed with vitamin B12. Delicious and healthy? Yes, please.  Beyond nutritional yeast, you just need a little lemon juice, salt, and garlic powder. Fresh herbs add a hint of color and flavor, but they are not necessary.   Once blended, your macadamia nut “cheese” is ready to enjoy! Yes, vegan cheese in 5 minutes – this is real life. It does, however, benefit from some time in the fridge, where it will stiffen and the flavors will develop. While that’s happening, prepare the rest of your vegetables. I LOVE the flavor and texture of the nut cheese with roasted vegetables, so I went with beets and carrots, which sweeten and caramelize when roasted. But you can also just stick toraw vegetables if you prefer to keep your oven off.  I hope you all LOVE this nut cheese + crudité! It’s: Easy Fast Healthy Flavorful Fresh Portable &amp; DELICIOUS This is the perfect meal or appetizer for things like BBQs, picnics, and happy hours. I think it’s a good amount for 4-6 people as a snack. Ortwo people could easily split thisas a meal and be very satisfied. In addition to the nut cheese, you can also serve this with hummus (I share several recipes below), baba ganoush, crackers, and roasted nuts. If you try this recipe, let us know!

This recipe is simple, usingeasy-to-master methodsand10 basics ingredients you likely have on hand right now. Plus,they come together in less than 1 hour! The shortcakesare adapted from my Best Damn Vegan Biscuits– a reader favorite. I made a few modifications, including a thicker vegan “buttermilk” of coconut milk instead of almond milk. And I made them gluten-free with a mix of my gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and cornstarch. The result is a seriously fluffy, tender shortcake that’s perfect for strawberries and coconut whipped cream.  These shortcakes bake up beautifully. I was so happy to see them rise well and brown on the outside. They formed a nice crust on the outside (swoon!), yet remained tender and fluffy on the inside. All that’s left to do is let these babies cool. Then we get to the important part: toppings!  For toppings, I went withCoconut Whipped Cream and strawberries sprinkled with cane sugar. But I also tried them later with grilled peaches (!!) and dairy-free ice cream! Both were delicious – you really can’t go wrong with toppings here.  I hope you all LOVE this shortcake! It’s: Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Perfectly sweet Easy to make Vegan &amp; Gluten-Free &amp; Seriously delicious This would make the perfect summertime dessert.

0,Green Spirulina Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Green Spirulina Smoothie (5 Ingredients!)  Summer is creepin’ on and I’m craving fresh, green things, like this green spirulina smoothie. What makes it super green? We’re about to find out. Shall we?  This smoothie is about as easy as it gets: 5 ingredients, 5 minutes, 1 blender. The base is frozen banana, cucumber (we learned about cucumber’s health benefitsin my Cucumber Smoothie), and coconut milk. I include hemp seed as an optional addition for healthy fats and protein. And last but not least, spirulina! I asked you guys on Twitter if you’d be interested in seeing any recipes with spirulina, and you said yes! I’ve included tips on where to buy and how to use it in the notes.  Spirulina is an extremely nutritious blue-greenalgaethat’s high in Bvitaminsand minerals like iodine, beta-carotene, antioxidants, iron, and manganese. It’s also 60% protein and a complete protein, containing all essential amino acids – 1 Tablespoon boasts 4 g protein. So what’s the big deal? Spirulina is a very concentrated source of vitamins and minerals and also very detoxifying and alkalizing to the body, which is why it’s considered a “super food” in many circles. I’ve been incorporating it mainly into my smoothies and loveits intense color, neutral flavor, and health benefits. It’s a great way to get a green smoothie without adding handfuls of kale. What does it taste like? Eaten directly, it has a somewhat unpleasant taste – kind of like seaweed. But, when thrown into smoothies or desserts, it’s undetectable. Huzzah!  I hope you all LOVE this gorgeous smoothie! It’s: Creamy Bright green Perfectly sweet Insanely nutritious Quick + Easy Portable &amp; Delicious This smoothiemakes the perfect plant-based breakfast or snack. For even more protein, add more hemp seeds, chia seeds, or your favorite vegan protein powder. And don’t forget your toppings!

Cheesy cuz it’s…queso?) But, in all seriousness, soak some cashews, roast your peppers, and ready your chips, folks. We’re making vegan queso.  I’ve made vegan queso before, bothfrom eggplant and from a semi-classic “roux” of garlic, oil, starch, and almond milk. But I had yet to tackle cashew queso. However,after a trip to one of my favorite Portland eateries – Prasad – my friend Jeanette ordered their roasted jalapeño queso and insisted I try it.Things haven’t been the same since. I had to remake this queso. My version is easy, requiring just 7 ingredients and a little over 1 hour to make. Plus, it’s oil-free for those of you avoiding oil, yet it remains ridiculously creamy thanks to the soaked cashews. The “cheesy” flavor primarily comes from nutritional yeast, which also adds a hefty serving of B vitamins and a gorgeous golden hue. It’s what we call a win-win situation. I hope you all LOVE this “cheese” sauce! It’s: Creamy Smoky Spicy Super flavorful Rich Cheesy &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect sauce to add to things like tacos, burritos, enchiladas, nachos, and more.

0,Vegan Breakfast Burrito With Scrambled Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Scrambled Tofu Breakfast Burrito (30 minutes!) Ah, the vegan breakfast burrito – a thing to behold. While we have a veganburrito in our cookbook, I’d yet to make one with tofu. And, truth be told, this version is a bit easier to make. No rice, no beans, no slaw. Just spiced, scrambled tofu, roasted vegetables, ripe avocado, and a sauce of your choice. Now that you’re imagining yourself with a vegan breakfast burrito in hand, let’s get to it!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish. And the ingredients are things you likely have on hand right now! The only thing I didn’t have was tortillas, which can be subbed with many things to keep this recipe gluten-free, such as corn tortillas, gluten-free wraps, or collard greens. While red peppers and potatoes roast away, scramble up some extra-firm tofu with smoky spices like cumin, chili powder, and garlic. Nutritional yeast and hummus add a bit of “umami” to the tofu that I just love. Nutritional yeastseems to have that effect in recipes.  All that’s left to do is wrap! Simply pile as many toppings as you can fit into a tortilla and roll away. If you’ve ever watched the burrito artists at Chipotle do this, you know it’s possible but not easy. You really have to roll and tuck to get everything inside. But trust me – the end result is worth it. I hope you all LOVE these burritos! They’re: Saucy Smoky Flavorful Fast Healthy &amp; So delicious These would make a delicious on-the-go breakfast for kids in the morning or for weekend adventuring like hiking or picnics.

0,Golden Turmeric Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Golden Goddess (Turmeric) Hummus  You know golden milk, right? Well, have you met her cousin golden hummus? She’s sort of a diva. She goes by goddess because she’s so vibrant in color and boasts mad anti-inflammatory effects. Give her a crown already (or at least a carrot). Also, you should totally invite her over because she might just change your life.  Golden goddess hummus? Yes, it’s a thing. When your food has fiber, protein, plant power, andtons of anti-inflammatory perks, you can call it a goddess. I checked (sorta). This 9-ingredient, 10-minute hummus gets its gorgeous golden hue from digestion-promotingfresh ginger, a pinch of metabolism-boosting cayenne pepper, and a generous sprinkle of both fresh and ground turmeric – the ultimate beauty spice.

0,Vegetable Pakoras (Gluten-Free and Vegan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mixed Vegetable Pakoras (30 minutes!)  Have you ever had a pakora? If not, you’re missing out. Think crispy, golden, battered, and pan-fried vegetables with big curryflavor. They’re similar to a classic onion ring but somehow better. And you can use just about any vegetable you have on hand. However,I’ve found this combo to be best. I even include my go-to, 5-minute green chutney dipping sauce. Shall we?  This recipe comes together in 30 minutes! And the ingredients aresimple. The only thing you may have to get is chickpea flour, which I’m realizing is quite useful to have around for gluten-free cooking. The batter is a mixture of water, chickpea flour (which makes this recipe vegan and gluten-free!), and spices. And, for the vegetables, I went with thinly sliced red onion, yellow potatoes, and cauliflower. I also tested red bell peppers and zucchini but didn’t enjoy quitethem as much.  Let’s talk cooking methods. I know that some of you are going to prefer a baked (low-fat) method, which I include in the notes. But, in my opinion, pakoras are an occasional treat worth splurging on.I highly recommend going for pan-fried, which doesn’t call for too much oil. The texture is noticeably crispier, the overall flavor is better, and the cooking process goesmuch faster. However, if you’d rather go oil-free, baking is great too. While your pakoras are crisping up, all that’s left to do is make my 5-minute, go-to green chutney, which makes this recipe in my opinion. Who wants a naked pakora? Not I.  I hope you LOVE these pakoras! They’re: Simple Crispy Subtly spiced So flavorful Easy to make &amp; Delicious These would make the perfect snack or side to dishes like my 1-Pot Sweet Potato Kale Curry, Coconut Red Curry with Chickpeas, Yellow Curry with Mango, or 1-Pot Lentil Dal.

The only “problem” with chickpeas as a base is 1) they don’t bind together well,and 2) they don’t quite emulate the fluffy texture of eggs or tofu. To the drawing board I went. I experimented, I asked your guys’ opinion on Twitter and Instagram, and I experimented some more. And onesuggestion – eggplant – was the golden ticket!  This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make! I even include some workarounds that make it even faster + easierif you’re short on time. The “secret” to this scramble is baba ganoush, which whips up in less than 15 minutes. It’s what helps bind the chickpeas together whilealso providing provide flavor, creaminess, and a bit of fluffiness! Eggplant for the win, once again.  While the eggplant is roasting, season your chickpeas! I went with a healthy mix of turmeric (an amazing anti-inflammatory!), ginger (great for digestion), and cumin (also helpful for digestion). A pinch of salt, pepper, and smoked paprikabring even more flavor to this delicious and wholesome scramble.  I hope you all LOVE this scramble! It’s: Fluffy Flavorful Wholesome Satisfying Easy to make &amp; Super tasty This would make the perfect breakfast or lunch when you’re craving something satisfying yet healthy. While it does require 30 minutes from scratch, you can usestore-bought baba ganoush to cut that down to 10-15 minutesor make the seasoned chickpeas and baba ganoushahead of time to throw into the skillet throughout the week!

And seeing as we are about to enter grilling season (at least in the Pacific Northwest!), it’s the perfect time for another a grillable plant-based recipe. Shall we?  The inspiration for this recipe came from Jamaican jerk chicken. It’s been so long since I’ve had that dish, but I’ve always been drawn to smoky, spicy, earthy foods.

The result is a sauce with BIG flavor that soaks right into the eggplant before they’re grilled to perfection. Mmmm.  For serving, I went for rice (you could also use cauliflower rice!). And I even whipped up an impromptu dippingsauce for serving, which is entirely optional but adds another wave of flavor I adore to this dish. I hope you LOVE this recipe!

0,Easy Vegan Golden Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Vegan Golden Milk  We’ve been digging golden milk for a while now, so it was due time to share my go-to recipe. If you haven’t tried golden milk yet, you’re missing out! It’s a creamy (dairy-free), hot milk drink that’s filled to the brim with nutrients. Yes, a delicious beverage with health benefits. Dreams do come true.  My version is inspired by the lovely Nutrition Strippedand requires just 8ingredients, 1 pot, and 5 minutes.We’ve been making McKel’sversion for quite some time now with a few modifications, and it’s now a daily obsession. I’ve found that using a mix of light (canned) coconut milk and unsweetened almond milk creates the perfect creamy base. I’ve tried using both fresh and ground turmeric and have tosay ground is better in terms of flavor! Coconut oil adds a touch of healthy fat and makes the turmeric more available for our bodies to absorb because it is fat-soluble. So don’t skip the oil! And by some wizardry, black pepper also makes the curcumin in turmeric more bioavailable, so it’s an important addition as well. To sweeten, you can go any number of ways. I typically go for a spoonful of maple syrup, and if it still needs some sweetness, a dash of stevia is perfect.   I hope you all love our go-to Golden Milk! It’s: Creamy Comforting Coconutty Turmeric + ginger-infused Slightly spicy Perfectly sweet Super healthy &amp; Delicious This is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up when you need something to tide you over till dinner. The health perks alone have made it a daily ritual for us. Anything anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich is a win in my book.

0,Healthy Almond Butter Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Butter Tofu Stir-Fry  If you’ve ever tried my recipe forHow to Make Tofu Taste Good(or the new quicker method),you’ve likely fallen in love with tofu.

But it’s since become my tried-and-true method for pretty much all things tofu!

0,Healthy Peanut Butter Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Peanut Butter Fudge (4 Ingredients!)  Peanut. Butter. Fudge. Yes, I’m on a fudge kick,and no one is gonna stop me.  This fudge was inspired by its chocolate fudge cousin and is somehow even easier to make. Probably because it only requires 4 ingredients and 30 minutes to make. And yes! It’s still naturally sweetened and surprisingly healthy for you (hello,protein and healthy fats). The base is made of coconut flakes whirled into coconut butter (a.k.a. nature’s frosting). Then comes a generous amount of creamy, salted peanut butter and melted coconut oil for a super-creamy texture. I tested the recipe without any coconut oil and must say it lacked that fudgy, creamy texture, so don’t skimp!

It’s such a healthy, easy, and versatile dish that pairs perfectly with all things Mediterranean. Without further ado, my take on tabbouleh salad!  This recipe is so easy, requiring just 6 ingredients, 10 minutes, and 1 bowl to make. The base is fresh, chopped parsley, red bell pepper, and red onion. I love eating parsley because it’s so healthy for you (hello, antioxidants) and great at detoxifying the body (especially when you throw in lemon!). I used to add grains to my salad, but it honestly takes too much time and I don’t feel that it was adding much in the way of texture or flavor. But feel free to add cooked, cooled quinoa, bulgur, or couscous!  Traditional tabbouleh calls fortomato. But, after realizingall I had was red bell pepper one night and using it in its place, I haven’t gone back. It adds even more crunch (plus beta carotene!) and a bit of sweetness, which I love. And I love that this is another no-mix dressing (i.e. dump the dressing over the salad sans mixing). Keep it easy, folks. I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s: Fresh Crunchy Citrusy Mega healthy Delicious Versatile &amp; Easy to make This salad makes a delicious side to Mediterranean mains like Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes, Chickpea Shawarma Sandwiches, and even Curry Lentil Soup!

(Trust me. It’s not as scary as it sounds.) Or, if you ever make your own almond milk,you likely have leftover pulp! You can put it to good use in these crackers. (Yet another reason to try this recipe.) What I’m saying is: These delicious crackers make excellentuse of ingredients you likely have in your pantry right now. Shall we?  This recipe requiring just a food processor (or bowl!) and 7 ingredients to make. The base is gluten-free flour blend and almond meal, and the flavor comes from salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. You could also add a littlenutritional yeast for cheesiness if you’d like (see my Vegan Cheez Its for inspiration).  Next comes oil and water to bring moisture to the dough. The fat adds a bit of flakiness, and water brings crispiness. A perfect balance of the two makes these crackers easy to roll out and form as well as spot-on in texture.

0,How to Make Aquafaba | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"A Guide to Aquafaba  If you’ve found this page you’re likely curious about aquafaba! What is it?  It’s is the liquid leftover from cooked chickpeas. You can obtain it two ways:  1) Drain a can of chickpeas and reserve the liquid. Or, 2) Cook your own chickpeas and reserve the leftover cooking liquid. The second method is less reliable, in my opinion, because the aquafaba can be too thin and you may need to cook it down, making it more time consuming.   Beginners should rely on aquafaba from canned chickpeas for ease!  How do you whip it?  The trick to whipping aquafaba is using a hand or stand mixer! Whisking it by hand takes quite a long time and does not produce as good of results in my experience. I use this hand mixerand it works like a dream. Whipping aquafaba generally takes 3-6 minutes to get to semi-firm peaks, depending on your equipment and how thick your aquafaba was to begin with. So take your time and don’t be discouraged if it takes some time to reach stiff peaks! It can requirea little practice and patience.  Tips + Tricks?  My main tip? Buy canned chickpeas instead of making your own from cooked chickeas. My favorite brand is Trader Joe’s Organic Chickpeas. My next tipis to throw in some cream of tartar, which causes the aquafaba to whip up much easier, faster, and makes the peaks firmer. See it at work in this VIDEO!  ﻿ How to Use It? Aquafaba can be used in a number of ways:  It can be added to recipes unwhippedas an egg binder, such as in these Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookies.It can also be used to makeVegan Mayo! It can be whipped into semi-stiff peaks and added to recipes as a whipped egg white substitute, such as these Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles! It can be whipped into stiff peaks and made into things like meringues and macaroons (recipes to come!).   Recipes!

0,Vegan Shamrock Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mint Matcha Shamrock Shake  This is my take on the classic shamrock shake! It’s creamy, minty, refreshing, and way healthier than the original! Plus, just 6 ingredients required, it’s 100% plant-based, and is refined sugar-free. Shall we?  The base is made with frozen coconut milk “ice cubes” blended with almond milk and a dash of coconut cream for thick and creamy texture. The mint flavor comes from fresh mint (!!) and peppermint extract. A handful of spinach adds some nutrients as well as a vibrant green color. And the shake is naturally sweetened with maple syrup or stevia.  This shake is: Icy Creamy Perfectly sweet Minty Surprisingly healthy &amp; So easy to make This is the perfect treat to enjoy on St. Patrick’s Day and beyond! You could even make it boozy with some Irish Whiskey, Bailey’s, or Creme de Menthe (just sayin’.)

0,Easy Vegan Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Vegan Fudge (30 minutes!)  This recipe tested my patience. I almost threw in the towel. Aren’t you glad I didn’t?  This fudgestarted as avocado truffles, which then morphed into avocado fudge, which inevitably ended up being a flop because, as hard as I tried to ignore it, I could always taste (and smell) the avocado in the background. Back to the drawing board. Next, I went for a vegan chocolate-inspired approach with cocoa butter and coconut oil. But it ended up a bit too waxy and somewhat oily for my liking. Back to the drawing board (again). Which brings us to the current magic that is this easy 1-bowl, 30-minute vegan fudgemadewith 8ingredients. Let’s dessert, shall we?   The base for this recipe is coconut, cocoa butter, nut butter, and cacao powder. This creates a fudgy, rich texturewith the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. This recipe is also naturally sweetened (something I really wanted to hang on to) with maple syrup and chopped dates. It all happens in the food processor before being poured into a pan and frozen. This recipe is not only easy to make, but also quick and virtually foolproof (the best kind of recipes).  I hope you all LOVE this fudge! It’s: Rich Dense Chocolaty Perfectly sweet Slightly nutty Subtly infused with coconut &amp; Insanely satisfying This is the perfect healthier dessert to have on hand for a weeknight treat. I keepmine in the fridgeand inevitably end up snacking on a piece after lunch and dinner. It’s that good!

0,Spicy Vegan Breakfast Sausage | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Tempeh Breakfast Sausage  If you follow us on Instagram, you know I’ve been sitting on this recipe for a while now with ample excitement. I’d been ponderinghow to make thisrecipe work for weeks, and after finally giving it a try, I’mSO pleased with the results. If you’re plant-based or trying to eat more that way, this vegan breakfast “sausage” is going to satisfy that savory morning protein craving like no other. Let’s do this!  This recipe does require more ingredients than I typically use, but it’s for a good cause. Every spice adds another layer of flavor to make these undetectably vegan “sausages!” The simple factor comes with the 1-bowl prepto save on dishes and clean up time. The base of this “sausage” is tempeh, which mocks the texture of sausage perfectly. Next comes a mixture of smoky, sweet, and spicy seasonings like smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Vegan Worcestershire sauce adds a “meaty” flavor, while a bit of oil adds moisture. Garlic and onion add texture and even more flavor. The fun part is the mixing, which I recommend doing with your hands. You can also do this in the food processor, but I prefer mixing in a bowl so you get more of a chunky mixture and less of a puree. Plus, using your hands is more fun – trust me. I highly recommend cooking these on the stovetop for a crusty outer edge and a tender middle. But I also tried baking these and it works as well if you’re trying to avoid or cut back on oil. Either way, these “sausages” are a major win!  I hope you all LOVE this sausage! It’s: Hearty Super flavorful Smoky Spicy Crisp on the outside Tender on the inside Easy to make &amp; SO delicious These are the perfect breakfast companion for things like my Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble, Breakfast Hash,Simple TofuQuiche, and Crispy Hash BrownHaystacks. Not to worry – I am also going to be testing this recipe for an updated Biscuits and Gravy recipe as well as other breakfast entrées, so stay tuned!

0,Vegan BLT Sandwich with Eggplant Bacon | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan “BLT” Sandwich  As promised, my take on a vegan “BLT” sandwich! Trust me, it was worth the wait.  This sandwich is seriously easy once you have your Eggplant Bacon (or Coconut Bacon) and Vegan Mayo prepared.And it only requires 6 ingredients! The base for this beauty is bread, such as my Easy Vegan Seeded Whole Grain Bread! Next comes a spread, eithervegan mayo or hummus!

0,Easy Vegan Mayo with Aquafaba | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Aquafaba Mayo  It’s happening:Easy vegan mayo that’s perfectly creamy, thick, and tangy!You can do this.   This recipe requiresjust 5 minutes,6ingredients, and1-bowl to prepare. The initial version of this recipe was made with a hand mixer, but I’ve since found that it doesn’t work for everyone, especially depending on the power of your mixer! So I’ve done more testing and now have a couple of ways this recipe works, including with both an immersion blender and a small upright blender (such as a Magic Bullet).   The base is aquafaba – the liquid/brine leftover in a can of chickpeas – which is blended with apple cider vinegar, brown rice syrup, mustard powder, and sea salt for flavor. Next comes a neutral oil for creaminess and body, which is streamed in while mixing. For oil, we found sunflower to work best, but avocado works too (just produces slightly less thick mayo).  I hope you all LOVE this mayo! It’s: Creamy Tangy Rich Easy to make &amp; Delicious This mayo is the beginning of so many wonderful things to come. It’s going to be perfect foraiolis,salad dressings, sandwiches, and more. It’s especially perfect on our Vegan BLT!

0,Crispy Eggplant Bacon | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Eggplant “Bacon”  After trying my hand at coconut bacon and loving the flavor, I was lefthoping for a texture that was closer to the real thing. Enter: Eggplant. We’ve used eggplant to make delicious things like Baba Ganoush, Harissa Eggplant Dip, Eggplant Lasagna Roll-Ups, andCashew-Less Vegan Queso, but bacon may perhaps be its most brilliant use yet. This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients(and it comes together in about 40 minutes). Thin strips of eggplant are marinatedin a mixture of smoky spices, maple syrup, tamari, and vegan Worcestershire for the ultimate savory, sweet, spicy flavor. The eggplant is then baked at a low temperature for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.   The result is crispy, smoky bacon-like strips that are 100% vegan and 100% delicious. I hope you all love this eggplant “bacon.” It’s: Smoky Crispy Salty Slightly chewy Easy to make Insanely flavorful &amp; SO delicious How does one use eggplant “bacon,” you ask? Great question. I enjoyed mine directly from the pan (true story), but it would also be delicious mixed into (or served alongside) a tofu scramble, layered on a sandwich (more to come soon!), or atop salads, dips, and so much more.

Ready your food processors, friends. Let’s make the tastiest snack on the block!  These energy bites are made with 6 simple ingredients in less than 30 minutes! The base is my favorite natural sweetener: dates!  I love dates because they’re nature’s caramel and boast minerals like zinc, potassium, magnesium, and iron! Walnuts come next, which add protein and are high in omega 3 fatty acids. Cacao powder adds rich chocolate flavor as well as phytonutrients, magnesium, and iron. Almond butter provides even more protein as well as vitamin E, manganese, and biotin. Andhemp seeds add omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, iron, magnesium, and zinc. Plus, they’re a perfect protein, boasting 20amino acids, including the 9 essential amino acids.  I think we can all agree that this is one healthy snack.  The texture of these bitesis close to a truffle! They’re so chocolatyand rich and moist. And when you roll them in cacao powder, they even get a little fudgy and sticky.

0,Crunchy Baked Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crunchy Baked Granola Bars  A recent beach trip found me at a cozy coffee shop nibbling on something like these granola bars.

Not only are these barsdreamy, but they’re easy to make, requiring just 9 ingredients. They also come together in less than 1 hour and don’t require a blender or food processor.

I love this mealbecause it’s healthy, satisfying, and comes together so quickly! Plus, Mexican food for the win. Let’s make nachos, shall we?  These nachos are simple, requiring just 7ingredients and 30 minutes to prepare! The base is kale chips (!!), lightly seasoned with smoky spices and nutritional yeast. Check out my basic recipe for these, which can modified to include any number of flavors or seasoning, like these 30-Minute Cheesy Kale Chips. Next comes pan-fried sweet potatoes – my new favorite way to make sweet potatoes super fast without requiringanother pan in the oven (so the kale chips can do their thang). This method allows the potatoesto get crispy on the outside while the inside remainstender, and the whole process takes just 7-8 minutes! Last but not least, simply heat up some cooked black beans and season with cumin and chili powder. I told you we could do this. Healthy nachos for the win.  All that’s left is assembly! The beauty of this recipe is that it’s super versatile and can betopped with anything you like. I personally love a little salsa, avocado, and red onion. But you could also make guacamole, throw on some hot sauce, or even add some Saucy Chipotle Tofu, which you can find in our Everyday Cooking Cookbook(under BraisedTofu Tostadas).

0,Vegan Chocolate Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffins (GF)  Remember those Vegan Banana Nut Muffins I made recently? If not, you should make them. Like, STAT. Well, as I was writing the post, I realized I had yet to make my second favorite flavor of muffin in gluten-free form. That had to change, obviously. Spoiler alert: It totally worked and they’re totally delicious.  This is another 1-bowl recipe! It also requires simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now. The base of the batter is flax eggs, applesauce, coconut oil, and almond milk. Good news! These muffins are naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar. To keep them gluten-free, I useda mixture of gluten-free oat flour, almond flour, and my DIY Gluten-Free Flour Blend. This is my go-to blend in most baked goods for keeping them light, airy, and tender. The chocolate flavor comes from cocoa powder and vegan dark chocolate chips (my favorites being Enjoy Life or Trader Joe’s). I suggest a modest amount of chocolate chips in the recipe, but then I went ahead and topped them with another hefty handful before baking. Because chocolate is life.  These muffins rise beautifullyand then fall a bit when they’re cooling. But not to worry! That doesn’t mean they’re not perfectly fluffy, tender, and crumbly on the inside. And I love how the top forms a bit of a crust while the inside remains super moist and chocolaty. Total swoon-fest. You’re gonna want, like, three of these with a glass of almond milk immediately. Trust me.  I hope you all LOVE these muffins! They’re: Chocolaty Tender Moist on the inside Crumblyon the outside Perfectly sweet Easy to make Naturally sweetened (!!) &amp; So delicious These would make the perfect healthier treat to accompany a breakfast such as a scramble or asmoothie.

(Yes, we totally do). Presenting a warm and savory Brussels sprout slaw that screams winter, is über comforting, and is quick and easy to make.  This recipe requires just 30 minutes and less than 10 ingredients to prepare. The base is shredded Brussels sprouts, which are tossed in a tangy, slightly sweet mustard sauce. Hubba.  Pecans add nuttiness and a little protein, while coconut bacon (!!) adds a lovely crunch and saltiness to thedish. This was admittedly my first time trying coconut bacon, and I was super impressed!

This smoothie requires 6 simple ingredients, a blender, and 5 minutes to make. The base is frozen ripe banana and wild, organic, frozen blueberries (a wintertime favorite of mine). Next comes almond butter for some plant-based protein and creaminess, and almond milk blends everything together. I also added flax and chia seed for plant-based fiber and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Not only is this smoothie healthy, it’s insanely delicious.

But, with a little inventiveness and lots of testing, I cracked the code! Friends, allow me to introduce your new BFF: Vegan White Chocolate Truffles!  Originally, I was testing this recipe with a base of cocoa butter, coconut cream, and cornstarch, but it turned out either like pudding or rock hard and crumbly. Back to the drawing board. In the midst of all of this, I was snacking on macadamia nuts – serendipitous, eh? – and gotthe idea to use them as a base with cocoa butter! Now, we’re making progress.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients to make! The method is easy, too: Blend macadamia nuts and coconut into abutter, add remaining ingredients, and mix. Then refrigerate and roll into truffles! The mixture of the nuts with the coconut creates the perfect creamy base, while cocoa butter adds that rich chocolate flavor and hardens them up so they form truffles! Swoon!

These really are my new favorite cookie. And, by new, I mean an old favorite (that’s beenveganized)! If you’ve tried these Almond Meal Cookies with Coconut and Chocolate Chips, you already know how amazing theyare. However, the recipe does require an egg, and a reader recently suggested/asked if I had tried veganizing them. Brilliant idea, reader. Thank you! Because I’m always testing new recipes, I rarely reach back and remake old ones. But this called fora special retest! Onto the show.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and roughly 1 hour (including chilling)! The base is shredded coconut and almond meal (I mixed in a little almond flour for added fluffiness). For sweetness, I stuck with organic brown sugar, but I also think coconut sugar would work if you’re trying to go au naturel. And coconut oil and vanilla are the only liquid ingredients, besides… Aquafaba! In place of the egg is aquafaba.Are you even surprised at this point? Aquafaba never lets me down. (See Peanut Butter Cup Cookies, Fluffy Sugar Cookies, Best-Ever Cornbread, Pumpkin Cake…The list goes on.) After the dough has been mixed and chilled for 30 minutes, scoop,bake for 12-15 minutes, and BAM. You have chocolate chip cookie perfection.  These cookies are AMAZING.

0,Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Gado-Gado Bowl (30 Minutes!)  We’ve nearly made it through January (!), and I don’t know about you, but my body is still craving vegetable-rich, healthy entrées. One of my easy, go-to meals is gado-gado – a traditional Indonesian dish we discovered when we went to Bali way back in 2013. The concept is simple: rice topped with raw or lightly steamed veggies and a spicy peanut sauce. That’s my kind of meal (and you better believe I ate plenty during our trip). Shall we?  This 30-minute recipe is adapted from my Sweet Potato Gado-Gado Bowl in our 31 Meals eCookbook– a month of healthy dinner recipes, plus a meal plan + grocery lists! In place of rice, I subbed quinoa for even more plant-based protein. For the vegetables, I kept things light and fresh (even omitting the classic steamed potatoes) for green beans, mung bean sprouts, red pepper, carrots, and cabbage. I didn’t hold out on the sauce though. When in doubt, add more peanut sauce. (That should totally be my life motto.)  Traditionally gado-gado peanut sauce is on the spicier side, so I add plenty of chili garlic sauce. But, if heat isn’t your thing, hold off and keep it on the sweet and tangy side. No judgments here. I hope you guys love this bowl! It’s: Healthy Hearty Colorful Nutritious Satisfying Quick + Easy Customizable &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect plant-based meal when you’re craving tons of veggies but also plenty of staying powder. Each serving boasts more than 20 grams of protein! And it’s so easy to customize. If you’re needing more carbs, add quartered, steamed baby potatoes. If you’re needing more protein, add my 25-Minute Crispy Tofu! Peanut-sensitive? Sub with another nut or seed butter (options listed below). The possibilitiesare endless. Plus, leftovers store and pack beautifully, making it ideal for lunches throughoutthe week. Total win.

0,Vegan Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Potato Salad  Sometimes, you just need a classic. Today is one of those days. Say hello to my vegan-ized version of potato salad. Creamy, savory, and hearty, it requires just 10 ingredients. What’s not to love?  This potato salad is made with red potatoes – my favorite – for the ultimate potato salad texture. (Yellow potatoes tend to get too soft + I love the red skin for a pop of color.) Fresh, chopped vegetables – I went with bell pepper, celery, and onion – add plenty of crunch and plant-based fiber. And last but not least, my cashew garlic-herb dressing marries everything together. I hope you all LOVE this potato salad! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Garlicky Vegetable-packed Portable Customizable &amp; Delicious If you aren’t into white potatoes, sweet potatoes could easily be subbed! And, depending on what’s in season where you live, feel free to swap out the veggies as well. The garlic-herb sauce works with pretty much any combination! Wondering what to serve with this?

0,Vegan Baked Chocolate Donuts (GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Chocolate Donuts (Vegan + GF)  Did you know there’s been a donut pan saga in our home? I’ve been contemplating making baked donuts for the blog since the very beginning, but I always had a hard time justifying a donut pan when my recipes require just standard, minimal equipment. I don’t even own a stand mixer! Yes, I take this minimalist stuff seriously. Fast forward nearly 5 years and practically everyone has a donut pan – except me. I’ve watched as other bloggers put out the most fabulous-looking baked donut recipes, and all the while, I – a longtime donut lover – have sat idly by, thinking they weren’t for me. Enough!I recently realized that it would be worth it if I put it to good use. Besides,what if I createda donut that was not onlysimple to make, but also undetectably vegan and gluten-free? Clearly, I bought thedonut panand haven’t looked back since. Friends, let’s make DONUTS (finally)!  This recipe is simple, requiring basic ingredients and 30 minutes to prepare! And they’re naturally sweetened and (vegan) butter-free! The base is adapted from my 1- Bowl VeganGF Chocolate Hazelnut Cake (hubba), only in place of the flax egg, I tested out aquafaba! No surprise – it totally worked. However, I also included some workarounds in the notes if you don’t have (or are afraid of) aquafaba. While your donuts bake, why not make an optional (but highly recommended) naturally-sweetened coconut oil glaze? That’s what I said! Doooo it! Doooo it!  I hope you all LOVE these donuts! They’re: Fluffy Chocolaty Perfectlysweet Quickto make &amp; Undetectably Vegan + GF These donuts would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast treat or healthier dessert! The optional glaze kind of seals the deal, in my opinion. Plus, it allows for fun toppings like cacao nibs, coconut flakes, and sprinkles!

0,The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles  I have made vegan, gluten-free waffles before, but none compare to these. These perfectwaffles are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, perfectly sweet, and undetectably vegan and gluten-free. Shall we?  This recipe was a reader request. Someone asked if I’d tested whipped aquafaba (the brine/liquid in a can of chickpeas) in classic waffles, which I hadn’t! So I got to work testing.Obviously, things worked in my favor. This recipe requires just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make. And, while pretty much any waffle iron will do, I have to say I recently retired my old waffle iron and replaced it with aBelgian-style waffle maker. Friends. I’m in love. It creates perfect, fluffy, massivewaffles with little effort and zero non-stick spray or greasing.There’s no turning back now. I’m henceforth a Belgian waffle girl.  The batter mixes up pretty much like any traditional waffle, except in place of whipped egg whites, I used whipped aquafaba, which I’ve used in my Fluffy Vegan Sugar Cookies, Peanut Butter Cup Cookies, Best Vegan Gluten Free Cornbread, Vegan Pumpkin Cake, and more! I think it’s safe to say aquafaba is the coolest egg substitute on the block and super versatile. It can be used straight from the can or whipped, and it mocks an egg beautifully in baked goods. Expect more recipes with it in the future!  I hope you LOVE these waffles! They’re: Crispy on the outside Fluffy on the inside Perfectly sweet Undetectably vegan + gluten-free Easy to make &amp; SOdelicious These are officially my new go-to waffle. They’ve received rave reviews in my circle of friends (for good reason). Expectflavor variations in the future – because carbs for breakfast for the win.

0,Coconut Green Curry,"Vibrant Coconut Green Curry  When we traveledto Japan,we found this amazing restaurant called Mr. Farmer (recommended by my pal, Erin). It was a hidden gem that had tons of juices, smoothies, salads, and vegan fare, and I was in absolute heaven. One of the dishes I enjoyed there no less than three times was a green curry so vibrant in color I was instantly obsessed. It was perfectly seasoned, creamy, and supercomforting when we were thousands of miles from home. You know the rest of the story. Once we got home, I got straight into the kitchen to try my hand at recreating this dish. The results? Kind of amazing.  This recipe requires just 9 ingredients and comes together in roughly 30 minutes (without sides). The green color in this dish comes from greens! I went with spinach, but I’m guessing you could easily opt for kale or even collard greens – whatever you have on hand. And for the intense curry flavor I went with my DIY Curry Powder (that I’m putting on everything these days), which gets diffused and slightly sweetened with light coconut milk. Swoon.  Once the flavors simmer together for a while, transfer to a blender and blend until creamy and smooth. Then place back on the stove to warm until thickened and bubbly. This curry was always destinedto be paired with brown rice, my Coconut Curried Greens, and my Crispy Tofu seasoned with DIY Curry Powder. How could I resist? The pairing is absolutely phenomenal. I ate the leftovers three nights in a row and was sad for the last bite to come. If you’d rather, you could also add green lentils to the sauce for protein, vegetables of choice like mushrooms or bell peppers, or even eggplant. The sauce is so flavorful and creamy it would pair well with just about anything you can dreamup.  I hope you all LOVE this curry! It’s: Creamy Vibrant in color Loaded with greens Insanely flavorful Versatile Comforting Healthy &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal for hosting or when you and your family are craving something a little more substantial yet still incredibly healthy.

If you follow myInstagram stories you likely already know I’ve been tinkering with my How To Make Tofu Taste Good recipe to make the process even faster (20-25 minutes!). I thought it wasn’t possibleto make crispy tofu without baking it for at least 30-40 minutes. But, I was wrong. One night when I was super hungry and desperate for dinner fast, I tried this new-and-improved method and it worked so well I’ve sinceused this one exclusively! It’s that good. I don’t know why I didn’t think of this sooner. Plus, it easily carves5-10 minutes off of the originalmethodand includesthe opportunity to add more seasonings.  Step 1: Preheat oven to 375 F (190 C) and wrap your extra firm tofu (this is important – anything less than extra firm won’t crisp up as fast or as well) and set something heavy on top like a cast iron skillet.  Step 2: Cube tofu and add to a mixing bowl. Season with salt and, depending on what type of dish you’re adding it to, season accordingly (i.e. curry powder for a curry dish, or a bit of tamari and/or chili garlic sauce for a stir-fry). I was adding mine to a green curry (coming later this week!), so I went with curry powder.  Step 3: Sauté in oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until browned on all sides (shaking the pan as needed to cook all sides). Step 4: Finish baking in the oven for about 15 minutes or until crispy and golden brown. Mmmm, yes, please. Now what? Add it to salads, curries, stir-fries and more! While seasoned well on the outside it will still benefit from a hearty sauce, like my stir-fry glaze,Almond Butter Tofu Glaze, or a NEW green curry sauce coming soon!

This recipe is super simple, requiring just 1 pan, 30 minutes and 10 ingredients. I even include a DIY curry powder seeing as I was out of my go-to jar and had to make my own. Spoiler alert: it’s gold dust and I want to put it on everything. Do it! Besides the curry powder, we’re talking collard greens, kale, sea salt, coconut sugar, and light coconut milk. This combination of ingredients makes by-far the tastiest (and healthiest!) greens I’ve ever tried. These may very well be on weekly rotation in our house moving forward.  I hope you all LOVE this recipe. It’s: Super flavorful Loaded with greens Richin plant-based protein + fiber Savory-sweet Insanely healthy &amp; Absolutely delicious Although these are great on their own, I think these greens would pair well with any of my curries: Coconut Red Curry with Chickpeas, Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower Wings, 1-Pot Sweet Potato Kale Curry, Green Curry with Chickpeas, Spicy Red Lentil Curry, 30-Minute Coconut Curry, Easy Chana Masala, Thai Yellow Curry with Mango, or my Coconut Curry Ramen.

0,Fluffy Vegan Gluten Free Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fluffy 1-Bowl Sugar Cookies (Vegan + GF)  We’ve officially reached the month of December and I have one thing on the brain: Cookies. OK, cookies and somehow convincing John to get a real Christmas tree this year. The old fake one is looking real sad. Send good vibes and tree care tips, please.  You may remember I made vegan gluten free cookies last year. However, with yet another year of recipe development under my belt, I’ve learned a lot since thenand have tried new techniques and gluten free flour blends. The result? I’ve cracked the code onperhaps the most fluffy, perfect gluten free vegan sugar cookies on the planet. Big claims, I know. But kinda true. Plus, this recipe is simple requiring just 1 bowl and less than45 minutesstart to finish. Ready to see this wizardly? Onward.  The base of these cookies is vegan butter, organic cane sugar and vanilla extract. For the egg, I went with aquafaba – the liquid left behind in a can of cooked chickpeas, which makes a lovely egg substitute in most vegan baking and whips up like egg whites! Magic, I know. I hope to do a post on aquafaba soon as I get a lot of questions about it and recipe requests, so stay tuned! But if you follow my instructions below you’ll be fine. Next comes my special blend of GF flours: Almond flour (which creates a perfect crumbly texture) Cornstarch (which puffs them up and providesshape + structure) Andmy DIY Gluten Free Flour Blend(for extra binding)  The batter only chills for 15 minutes while the oven preheats, during which time you can make your frosting. These little dudes are also quite delicious plain if you’d rather keep things simple. And may I add that these cookies are undetectably vegan and gluten free and are eerily reminiscent of Lofthouse sugar cookies!? Yeah, I know. Exciting stuff. Give them a try for yourself and let me know how it goes.

0,Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garlic &amp; White Wine Pasta with Brussels Sprouts  This. Pasta. Tho. I’ve made alfredo before, but this, this may be my new favorite.   What sets it apart? Garlic and white wine, which are infused into a classic white sauce paired with al dente pasta and roasted Brussels Sprouts. Now we’re talking.  This recipe requires 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to make. While the sauce is bubbling away and pasta is cooking to perfection, Brussels Sprouts are roasting until golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside. This is comfort food at its finest.

0,Creamy Chickpea Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Kale Salad with Chickpeas &amp; Shallot  This salad came to my mind right as I wasfalling asleep. Does your brain ever do crazy stuff like that? My best ideasseem to come when I’m about to doze off anddon’t have a notebook or pen to write things down, so I just make a pact with my brain to remember. And the next daywe both do our best to recallwhat we were thinking. Thankfully, this one made it through the pipeline! Three cheers for my old lady brain still working!  I’ve made many a kale salad before, but this one is special. This is the answer to the question, “What’s super cozy, flavorful and perfect for Thanksgiving?” This Mediterranean/Egyptian flavor pairing came to mind, and the recipe is adapted from my all-time favorite Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare! The base is kale massaged with lemon juice and olive oil. Then comes freshly grated beets (which to me taste like candy in salads!). Next is pan-fried gluten free shallots that literally take 5 minutes, and Mediterranean baked chickpeas. The final touch? Dukkah! Which is an Egyptian spice blend used to seasonsauces, protein, and things like this delicious salad! Dukkah isa totally optional ingredient but such a fun topper for this dish. It not only adds smoky, nutty flavor, but also a little crunch.  The dressing is SO easy (and dreamy). Tahini is blended with fresh garlic, lemon juice, and maple syrup. Add water to thin and ‘voila!’ You have a super creamy, lemony dressing ready to coat those gorgeous greens. Look at that salad goodness.  I hope you all LOVE this kale salad!

I haven’t posted a recipe that’s not gluten freein a while because I’vebeen trying toavoidglutensince January to see if it’s causing of any of my health concerns (which I also wrote about inthis Cleanse review). The jury is still out. I feel fine on the few occasions I have eaten it – i.e. no stomach cramps – but I’m still on the fence about whether it really adds any benefit to my diet. So for now, I avoid it. With that being said,one exception I think I may make moving forward is whole grain, easy-to-digest flours like spelt or fermented sourdough bread on occasion. Besides, making fluffy, Thanksgiving-worthy rolls gluten free is virtually impossible in my experience. So today, I make exceptions and indulge.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredientsand extremely simple methods! The dough is a mixture of almond milk, yeast, cane sugar, salt, olive oil and spelt flour. After resting, roll into balls and topwith oats. Just a 1-hour rise before going into the oven where they bakeup to golden perfection (see above)!

0,Spicy Vegan Cheese Ball | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Vegan Pimento Cheese Ball  You guys. I made a cheese ball. Yes, another cheese ball. But this one is spicy, so it’s totally my jam. And guess what? Now you have something delicious to serve your dairy sensitive / vegan guests as they arrive at your party! Isn’t that grand?  This cheese is simple to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and surprisingly simple methods. If you can soak and blend cashews with spices and then wrap it in a towel, you can make this cheese. I believe in you – you got this. The base is soaked cashews and vegan cream cheese for extra creamy texture and a little tang. The cheesiness comes from nutritional yeast, and the spicecomes from garlic, smoked paprika, pimento peppers, and cayenne pepper. This combination of ingredients creates a seriously dreamy cheese ball that’s spicy – but not too spicy – and insanely flavorful.  Once the cheese has had some time to rest in the fridge, it becomes semi-firm and moldable, but remains creamy – that’s what you want. This is an optional step, but I chose to coat mine in a blend of the spices for extra kick: paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne, salt, and chili pepper. Plus, look at that color! I couldn’t resist.  I hope you all love this recipe! It’s: Creamy Cheesy Super flavorful Perfectly spicy Satisfying Spreadable &amp; So delicious This would make the perfect appetizer for Thanksgiving, or anytime of year! It holds its shape for 2 hours outside of the fridge and keepsup to 5 days making this a great recipe to make ahead of time and set out just as your guests arrive. You so fancy.

Are you prepared for all this deliciousness? In case you missed it, Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls and Roasted Squash, Pecan &amp; Pomegranate Salad are already on the table. What’s missing? Pasta salad!Let’s fix that.  Originally I had planned to make a traditional pasta salad modeled after this Vegan Macaroni Salad, but when I made the dressing it just wasn’tthe quite flavor combination I had in mind. I had a cravingfor pesto and decided to switchdirections. This pasta salad is vegan and gluten free, comes together in about 30 minutes, and requires just 9 ingredients! This could be one of the last things you prepare for your Thanksgiving feast, or you can even makeit ahead of time and let it rest whileeverything else finishes upas the flavors seem to improvethe longer it hangs out. The base is gluten free penne (I share my favorite brand below!), roasted tomatoes (use parchment paper while roasting unless you want a sad, blackened baking sheet like mine), and an insanely delicious and simple pesto dressing. Classic flavors, easy preparation, big flavor.  I hope you all love this recipe!

0,"Roasted Squash, Pecan, & Pomegranate Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Roasted Squash, Pecan, &amp; Pomegranate Salad  Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza recipe #2?Squash! Do you rememberwhat I didlast year? I made a Butternut Squash Sweet Potato Casserole (yes, a hot dish) for Thanksgiving. And? It was amazing! My aunts even made it at my grandma’s house for the big day! The Midwesterner in me was so proud. I wanted to incorporate squash and sweet potatoes again this year, because, carbs. But I wanted to simplify and class things up a bit. Hence, a salad (made of mostly carbs)! Shall we?  The base of this 9-ingredient dish is roasted butternut squash and (or) sweet potatoes. Roastwithcoconut oil, spices, and a little maple syrup and coconut sugar until golden and tender. It’s so delicious you’ll eat half before it’s ever assembled (according to a friend of mine – not me, of course).  While the squash is roasting, toast up some pecans and then – right on the pan – toss them with coconut oil, coconut sugar, maple syrup and spices and roast 5 minutes more until golden brown and crispy and SO DELICIOUS. Again, my friend said she ate like half of them before serving. I can’tbelieve her. Such a lack of self-control.  For the dressing, I was hemming and hawing between savory, sweet, ortangy, until I remembered pomegranate molasses existed! Have you ever tried it? It’s tangy and slightly sweet and so flavorful. I use it in my Fesenjanrecipe (find the vegan version in our Cookbook!) and it makes the dish. You can either buy pomegranate molasses or make it at home by cooking down pomegranate juice into a semi-glaze consistency (like you would balsamic vinegar). It only takes about 20 minutes and you’re left with a 1-ingredient dressing that complements this “salad” beautifully. For serving, I opted for a bed of arugula and red onion. But to behonest, it was just for color. You can definitely just serve the squash with pecans and pomegranate molasses and this would be a show stopper. But it never hurts to sneak in more greens when you can (so they say).  I hope you all love this dish! It’s: Festive Hearty Savory-sweet Vegetable-packed Nutrient-rich &amp; So delicious I’m envisioningthis beingthe “I can’t keep my hands off it” side dish this Thanksgiving (and all fall + winter long for that matter).

0,Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Fall Soup in Acorn Squash Bowls  We’re in the final countdown to Thanksgiving festivities and I have yet to provide you with an entrée option. Not to worry! Acorn squash to the rescue. PLUS,I have an exciting announcement! This is the first recipe in a week-long seriesI’m calling Thanksgiving Week Extravaganza, wherein I post a recipe every day leading up to my Thanksgiving Round-Upon November 23! That’s right: EIGHT recipes that will cover your mains, sides, appetizers, and of course, dessert. Let’s start with this show-stopper of a main, shall we?  Last year when pondering a plant-based Thanksgiving entrée my mind immediately went to: What would I actually make and eat on Thanksgiving? And my Sweet Potato Chickpea Thanksgiving Wrap was the answer. This year, I was craving something a little more festive, a little more colorful, and a little morecomforting. So I made the easiest, creamy fall soup (ever) and served it in roasted acorn squash “bowls.” The result is a creamy, decadent, nutrient-rich soup that will “wow” guests and leave you feeling all warm and cozy inside.  Not only is this soup healthy and delicious, but it’s also easy to make, requiring just 10 basic ingredients you likely have on hand right now, and just 1 1/2 hours to prepare (including roasting acorn squash). The base is a mixture of onion, garlic and your vegetables of choice! I went with a mixture of carrots and butternut squash, but pretty much any winter squash or hearty root vegetable will do here (think pumpkin and beets).  Next comes the fun part. Will you add lentils? Mung beans? Sage? Bay leaf? Or go with a curry adaption? You decide. To keep things simple I added a little fresh sage and a bay leafto infuse plenty of classic fall soup flavor. And for a bitof protein and fiber I added red lentils because they cook quickly (in the soup!) and absorb flavors well.  While the soup is coming together roast your squash bowls until golden brown, tender and sweet. However, if squash bowls seem a little too over the top for you, you can totally skip this part and the recipe would become a 1-pot, 45-minute wonder. How cool is that?  I hope you all love this soup. It’s: Creamy Savory Vegetable-heavy Fiber- &amp; protein-rich Full of flavor Wholesome Comforting &amp; Delicious I think this would make the perfect alternative Thanksgiving entrée or even a side. You could pair this with my Vegan Thanksgiving Wrap,White Bean KaleSalad with Tahini Dresingor Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas, and a little Sangria for a classy, festive meal. For more Thanksgiving ideas, I’ll be sharing a round-up next week. In the meantime, feel free to check out last year’s! Oh, and don’t forget the Pumpkin Pie or Bars!

Only this version is naturally sweetened, has a no-fuss almond-oat crust, requires just 10 ingredients, and is made entirely in the blender. Yeah, I’m bringin’ the heat (is that still something the kids say?).  While I do love atraditional pumpkin pie, this one may be slightly better because of the no-fuss crust! Just blend oats and almond flour and press into a baking dish instead of mixing with a pastry cutter, rolling and thentransferring the crust to a pie pan. Ain’t nobody got time for that.  NEWS! I have an update for my go-to almond oat crust:Almond flour in place of whole almonds/meal. Almond flour is made of blanched almonds instead of raw almonds and creates a lighter texture and less harsh almond flavor in baked goods. It’s an easy swapthat makes the crust even more perfect and undetectably gluten free! I’ve found almond flour to be generally more expensive than almond meal, but I’ve found it’s worth it for the better texture and flavor. Plus, I’ve been ordering a 2-lb. bag of WellBee’s from Amazonfor a better price than store-bought and had great success with it! I did a little research and found out that not all almond flours are made equal, so I’d highly recommend trying this brand first! I plan to use almond flour a little more around here, especially in gluten free baking as it seems to be superior (to almond meal) in gluten-free baked goods. OK, onto the filling!  I hope you all love these bars! They’re: Creamy Pumpkin-y Subtly spiced Perfectly sweet Wholesome Naturally sweetened &amp; Crazy delicious These bars would make the perfect dessert to bring along to holiday gatherings.

Simply slice onions into rings and dredgein a mixture of brown rice, cornmeal, salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne pepper. It’s as easy as that! To cook, I went for pan frying, because I never met a baked onion ring I liked. In fact, I tested a baked version of this recipe and it was a total no go. Burnt on the outside, stringy on the inside, and the coating fell off (saddest day).  I hope you all LOVE these rings! They’re: Crispy, crunchy Savory on the outside Sweet on the inside Perfect spiced Comforting Indulgent &amp; Kind of amazing These would make the perfect snack or appetizer for a day spent watching sporting events or Netflix re-runs, especially when paired with my Whiskey BBQ Ketchup or Vegan Chipotle Aioli (pictured above)!

0,5-Ingredient Chipotle Aioli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Chipotle Aioli  Whoa, guys. Like whoa. Chipotle aioli with 5 ingredients? This calls for a french fry and veggie burger party.  This dip has been a long time in the making. Any time we go to a restaurant, my eyes always go to the sauce section. I’m a sauce freak and always hope they have some dairy-free options. My favorite dip – besides ketchup, obviously – is chipotle aioli. It’s creamy, it’s salty, it’s spicy – it’s everything. This is my 5-ingredient, vegan, gluten-free restaurant-inspired version.  I tried using chickpea brine as a base to whip up a “mayo-” like texture, but it failed miserably. Trusty cashews never let me down. The rest is simple: lemon juice, salt, water (or almond milk), and a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. The result is an insanely creamy, savory, spicy “aioli”perfect for: Grillable Veggie Burgers Sweet Potato Black Bean Burgers Mexican Green Chili Burgers Sun-dried Tomato Chickpea Burgers Chickpea + Sunflower Seed Sandwich Cajun Sweet Potato Fries Crispy Matchstick Oven Baked Fries &amp; more!

0,Eggplant & Almond Butter Tofu Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sesame Eggplant &amp; Almond Butter Tofu Bowls  It’s been a few months since we’ve been in our new (and first!) home, but I still get nostalgic about our old neighborhood even though it’s just 10 minutesaway, and our new neighborhood is pretty awesome as well. In our old apartment, we were super close to a Boké Bowl – a healthy, Asian, “fast food” restaurant in Portland. My favorite dish there was definitely the tofu rice bowl. Tender, sticky rice, perfectly fried tofu, seared eggplant, and kimchi. It was so delicious I knew I had to recreate it at home. Consider this my inspired version.  This dish requires just 30 minutes to make, and it can be modified to taste and what’s in season. Currently, I’m digging on eggplant (these are little Japanese eggplant!). But you can also go for something like sugar snap peas, squash, or bell pepper if that’s more your thing. The base is rice, the protein is my go-to almond butter tofu, and the toppings are abundant. Kimchi strongly recommended.   This dish is like a hug from fall. It’s: Hearty Comforting Saucey Vegetable-packed Protein- + Fiber-rich Quick Healthy &amp;Insanelydelicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something healthy yet satisfying. It’s delicious on its own, but it would also pair especially well with my 20-minute Asian Kale Salad, or these Healthy Spring Rolls! If you try this recipe, let us know!

No literally, just tea and soup. Oh, and hot showers and hot cocoa. I basically hibernate like a bear all winter.  While John and I don’t agree on all food choices (he hates sweet potatoes, but they’re my only love), we do agree that ramen is where it’s at and frequently seek it out for dinner – especially in the fall and winter. I love how savory and comfortingit is, and how amazingly full I get on broth, rice noodles and vegetables. It’s magic. I loved makingvegan ramen last year andwanted to try it again. But this time, the broth was inspired by our go-toPortland ramen shop, Boxer Ramen. Their vegetarian broth is insanely delicious and has a unique flavor profile. Although I was skeptical at first, the coconut curry infusionjust makes sense. It adds a whole other dimension to the broth – warmth, spice, slight sweetness. I’m in love. Consider this my inspired version that requires just 10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour to make.  I hope you guys LOVE this ramen! It’s: Healthy Savory Comforting Curry-infused Perfectly spiced Vegetable-forward &amp; Perfect forcolder weather This would make a delicious and comforting meal when you’re craving something lightyetsatisfying. The toppings and noodles are extremely versatile, so everyone can pick and choose how to styletheir bowls.

0,Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Pumpkin Cake (Vegan + GF)  How is it mid-October already and I’m only just now postinga pumpkin recipe? Can you forgive me? Please say yes. Please say yes. Please be my friend.  This pumpkin cake is inspired by fall and my love for all the pumpkin things and my Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread. It’s simple, requiring just 1 bowl to make! And it comes together in about 1 hour.How cool is that?  I’ve been doing more experimenting withaquafaba as an “egg” in gluten-free baking and it’s working wonders. This cake is another proud accomplishment in my line of testing vegan/gluten free goods. Oh joy (and more to come). The base is whipped aquafaba (chickpea brine) and coconut sugar, which keeps this cake entirely naturally sweetened! Cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice amp up the fall flavor, while pumpkin puree and banana add incredibly moist texture and natural sweetness.  The result is a fluffy, tender, pumpkin-infused cake laced with rolled oats and almond flour. As for the gluten-free blend, Iwent with a light blend I’ve been loving lately. But I feel pretty confident that, as long as it’s a rice-based blend, it should do well here! And of course, if you’re not gluten-free, feel free to sub spelt flour, whole-wheat flour, or unbleached all-purpose for the gluten-free blend.  I hope you all LOVE this cake! It’s: Tender Fluffy Wholesome Naturally sweetened Pumpkiny Perfectly-spiced Hearty &amp; Insanely delicious This would make the perfect cake for entertaining this fall or if you just want something special on hand for a lazy weekend. I opted for my vegan cream cheese frosting – which requires the cake to be refrigerated – but you could easily go for my vegan buttercream frosting as well (recipes linked below).

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Zucchini Lasagna | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"8-Ingredient Zucchini Lasagna (GF)  Whoa. Like whoa. Guys, you’ve never had lasagna like this before. Trust me.  What sets this 8-ingredient lasagna apart from the rest is two things: Veggie ‘noodles’ and a brand new-to-me vegan ‘ricotta cheese.’ Have you guys tried macadamia nut ‘cheese’ yet? You know how I love my tofu ricotta, but this macadamia version is ridiculously easy (no soaking required!) and very close in flavor and texture to the real thing! Plus, it turns out all fluffy and cheesy and green from fresh basil. Ooh mama.  In place of noodles, I opted for ribboned (thinly sliced) zucchini squash, but you could also sub eggplant,sweet potatoes or gluten-free lasagna noodles. You could also use the macadamia ricotta to adapt my Spaghetti Squash Lasagna Bakefor another delicious lasagna-inspired dish!  I hope you all LOVE this lasagna! It’s: Super simple Nutritious Flavorful Vegetable-packed Protein- &amp;fiber-rich Hearty &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something hearty, healthy, and more special than pasta and red sauce (not that there’s anything wrong with that).

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Cornbread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Cornbread  Growing up, cornbread was one of my favorite side dishes, especially alongside chili. My mom would serve it with butter and maple syrup and I would go nuts. It’s no wonder – I’ve always loved carbs.  In the past few yearsI’ve attempted vegancornbreadwith success. However, I had yet to crack the code on vegan, gluten-free cornbread. Without eggs, gluten-free baked goods tend not to rise and miss that crumbly texture necessaryin cakes and quick breads. However, recently I hopped on the aquafaba bandwagon and things have changed. Unless you’ve been napping for the last year, you’ve likely heard of aquafaba – the starchy brine left behind in a can of chickpeas (or other beans, such as white and kidney beans). The brine has the protein and wizardry necessary to mock an egg and even whip up and bake into things like meringues and pavlova! It’s kind of amazing. While I haven’t perfected my meringue or played around much with aquafaba as a stand-alone ingredient (yet), I have been loving it as an egg substitute in gluten-free baking.  This recipe is easy, requiring just 10 basic ingredients. Plus, it’s extremely simple if you know how to turn on a hand mixer and whip up egg whites. Aquafaba behavesthe exact same as egg whites, creating a stable base and binding agent for this fluffy, perfect cornbread.  I know some of you may be temptedto sub out the organic cane sugar for a more natural sweetener, but I would beg you not to do so. The texture and flavor of the cornbread is compromised when things like coconut sugar or maple syrup are subbed in and I know this by experience. The only thing that might work is subbing stevia for 1/4 cup of the sugar. Otherwise, I hope you’ll try it and love it as is!  I hope you all LOVE this cornbread! It’s: Fluffy Tender Crumbly Perfectly sweet Easy to make &amp; Ideal for fall + winter! This is the perfect hearty comfort food to have on hand this fall and winter to pair alongside dishes like 1-Pot Vegan Chili, Vegan ‘Pulled Pork’ Sandwich, and Vegan Sloppy Joe’s! In my opinion, it’s almost undetectably vegan and gluten-free so everyone can enjoy (but no one will be able tell the difference). If not gluten free, try my Best Vegan Cornbread for 2!

0,Vegan and GF Apple Pie Crumble Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Apple Pie Crumble Bars (Vegan + GF)  Wow. Apple season is here (at least in the Pacific Northwest!) and I couldn’t be more thrilled. When I worked at a sandwich shop in college, I used tobring a granny smith apple in every day for my mid-morning snack. I literally ate an apple a day everyday for, like, two years. That’s love!  This recipe takes my love for apples into new territory. They remind me of apple crisp and apple pie and apple strudel all wrapped into one! Plus, just 10 ingredients and 1 hour required before these delicious Apple Pie Crumble bars are on your plate. Let’s do this!  The crust is my go-to almond oat crust that knows no bounds. I’ve now used it to make Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble Bars, Baked Vegan Cheesecake, Peanut Butter and Jelly Snack Bars and soon-to-be more fall treats! Stay tuned. I love it because it’s simple: Oats, almonds, coconut sugar, salt, and coconut oil. That’s it! And when it bakes up it’s reminiscent of graham cracker crust but without all the weird ingredients and preservatives.  The apples are tossed in cinnamon, lemon juice, and coconut sugar before they’re pre-baked for that quintessential tender, tart-sweet apple pie texture. And the topping is easy, too! Simply mix coconut sugar, oats, gluten-free flour, and coconut oil together and crumble over the top for a crumbly, slightly crisp topping.  All that’s left is slicing and topping with an optional 2-ingredient powdered sugar and almond milk glaze! In my opinion, this really sends these bars over the top. But they would be equally delicious as is or topped with Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream or Coconut Whipped Cream! I think they would also be amazing with my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from the cookbook! If you try these crumbly Apple Pie Bars, let us know!

0,1-Pot Chickpea Shakshuka | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Chickpea Shakshuka  During our time in Vancouver, we tried lots of delicious restaurants, one beingMedina – famous for its brunch. The long line was worth the wait on a cold dreary morning and all I was craving was a hot beverage and a comforting pot of something warm and delicious. One bite into thetagine (a close cousin to the North African dish known as “shakshuka”) and the smoky, intenseflavors in the tomato sauce, I was hooked! I got to work recreating this dish once we returned home.  This 30-minute, 1-pot meal starts with a mixture of onions, garlic, and bell pepper. Next comes tomato puree (or diced tomatoes) and tomato paste for plenty of rich, hearty flavor. Seasonings can practicallybe whatever you have in your pantry, but I felt thatcumin, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, coriander, and cardamom worked best, giving the dish a smoky, earthy, rich, and comfortingflavor.  Next comes cooked chickpeas and olives to provide a little more saltiness and substance. Plant protein to the rescue! This dish is quite amazing. It’s: Smoky Tomato-y Rich Hearty Spicy Comforting Vegetable-forward Protein- &amp; fiber-rich &amp; Insanely easy to make! This is the type of plant-based meal that can be enjoyed at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. From what I gather, shakshuka is traditionally a baked egg dish, but I swapped in chickpeas for the protein. Serve with toasted bread, flatbread, or over rice, cauliflower rice, or gluten-free pasta of choice! I think this pairs especially well with my Garlicky Chickpea Kale Salad.

0,Vegan Chocolate Malt (3 Ingredients!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Vegan Chocolate Malt  You get a malt. You get a malt. You get a malt. Everybody gets as malt! Don’t mind me. I just think saying things in an Oprah voice will never not be funny.  Did you know I used to bean ice cream scooper? In high school, I worked in a movie theatre witha restaurant inside and I made all the milkshakes, cherry limeades, sundaes, etc. It was a hard job, but someone had to do it (poor, poor me). One of my favorite things to make waschocolate malts. To behonest, if there was a little extra leftover, it totally went into my cup. Shhh, don’t tell my old boss. I’m sure there’s still some way I’d get in trouble for that.  This, however, isn’t your average malt. For starters, just 3 ingredients, 1 blender, and 5 minutes required. Second, it’s dairy-free thanks to Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream (hubba). Third, it’s made with HOMEMADE Vegan Chocolate Syrup (that’s naturally sweetened)! Lastly, the malt flavor doesn’t come fromsome mystery powder (what is that stuff anyway?). It’s thesuperfood maca.  Maca not only adds antioxidants and amino acids and rainbows and unicorns (I kid, I kid), it also adds a smoky, malty flavor that is reminiscent of a traditional malt. Yipee for healthy swaps!  Look at that swirl, tho. I hope you all love this malt! It’s: Creamy Thick Perfectly Super chocolaty Malty &amp; Oh-so delicious This is the perfect dessert to make when you want to indulge while alsoreaping a fewhealth benefits. Not into chocolate (who are you?)? Leave it outandgo for vanilla! Or add some strawberries for a fruity twist. Dream big, people.

This isn’t just any chocolate sauce. It’snaturally sweetened thanks to maple syrup (or stevia), and cocoa butter in place of dark chocolate.

This recipe was inspired by my love for the combination of anything kale and sweet potatoand my intense passion for putting curry paste in and on everything. Get on board.  This recipe starts with coconut oil, ginger, pepper, garlic, and red curry paste. Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness, and maple syrup and turmeric add flavor and balance out the heat. I love how the sweet potato and kale marry perfectly together to create a tender sweetness with a dose of earthy greens. Talk about two superfoods in one pot. Next comes a few green peas and cashews for a kick of plant-based protein.  I hope you all love this curry!

0,Red Curry Cauliflower Wings | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Red Curry Cauliflower “Wings”  OK, guys. This is big. Have you tried cauliflower wings? They’ve been a thing on the internet for a while, but I only recently gave them a try. And before you roll your eyes and say cauliflower isn’t your wing (get it? It’s a pun) or vegetable of choice, hear me out. This is one recipe you don’t want to miss.  While I haven’t tried the traditional“hot wing” recipe using hot sauce yet, this one by Hot For Food looks amazing and I used it as a basis for developing this recipe. The original idea for these wingscame from a reader (hi!) who requested a recipe for curry-spiced cauliflower breaded in chickpea flour and served with chimichurri sauce – a beloved dish from a local restaurant in their area. I tried to wrap my brain around that concept, did a little research on chickpea breading methods, and then got to work. Spoiler alert – the results were mind blowing.  This recipe requires just 9 ingredientsyou likely have on hand right now. Cauliflower may bea cruciferous veg that gets mixed reviews from people, but I happen to love it (have you tried this masala spiced tofu scramble yet?). It’s coated in a brown rice- (or chickpea flour-) based batter seasoned with curry powder and tandoori masala spice blend. YUM.  First, it’s baked to roast the cauliflower until slightly softened. And then the fun part – tossing in a curry paste glaze! It’s simple: red curry paste, maple syrup, coconut oil, and a little water. The result is abeautiful red sauce that coats the cauliflower before it’s thrown back into the oven and roasted until golden brown, sticky, and all kinds of delicious.  The chutney sauce is optional, but I highly recommend it! Plus, it’s easy and comes together while your wings are roasting.  I hope you guys LOVE these wings. They’re: Spicy Saucy Tender Sticky Super flavorful Easy &amp; Insanely delicious How does one enjoy cauliflower wings? As a snack, appetizer, side to curry or salads, when the “big game” is on (or whatever the sporting folks say). I personally devouredthese as a late lunch. However you enjoy them, you can’t go wrong.

I learned this technique from my mom (thanks, Mom!). Simply peel and slice apples and cook on the stovetop with a little cinnamon and (coconut) sugar until tender, and then turn up the heat at the end to slightly caramelize. Works like a charm. It’s the perfect way to get your apple pie fix in 30 minutes.  While your apples are cooking, roast up some cinnamon sugar pecans. This all happens on one baking sheet – the lazy girl’s dream!Simply roastfor a few minutes. Then top with cinnamon, coconut sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt and toss. Roast foranother few minutes and you have insanely gorgeous, roasty, toasty pecans on your hands. Yum. These are perfect for salads, snacking, or this sundae (I can’t wait, you guys).  All that’s left is scooping upyour Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Creamor Coconut Whipped Cream. We’re so close I can taste it. Caramel sauce is completely optional but does send this sundaeover the top. Either thin Date Caramel onthe stove top with a little maple syrup or go for my Coconut Sugar Caramel Sauce from our Cookbook!

0,Quinoa Chickpea Buddha Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Chickpea Buddha Bowl  This summer has beena glorious mix of amazing weather, trips to the farmers market, and travels to new cities. Sincesummer is on its way out (booo) I thought it appropriateto highlight one of my go-to meals recently: This 7-ingredient kale, quinoa, chickpea Buddha Bowl. It may seem simpleand just like any other wholesome bowl, but the flavors meld together perfectly, it’s a nutrient powerhouse (with 22 g protein per serving), andits simplicity is the best part (anyone can make it)! Interested in how this delicious bowl is made? Please follow me.  This recipe is inspired by the Mighty Bowl at Prasad (one of my favorite Portland restaurants) and starts with cooked-from-scratch chickpeas (which are totally easy by the way). My new go-toquick soak method tenderizes the beans and opens them up nicely, saving you (6-8) hours of overnight soaking. Cook immediately after soaking and you have delicious, tender, nutrient-rich beans in roughly 2 hours flat.  In the final minutes of the beanscooking, it’s time to prepareyour quinoa (a gluten-free, protein powerhouse), make your 3-ingredient Tahini Sauce, and steam your kale (why kale is amazing, in case you aren’t convinced). Then it’s Buddha Bowl building time.  I hope you all LOVE this bowl! It’s: Simple Easy to make Incredibly nutritious Protein- + fiber-rich Vegetable-packed &amp; Crazy delicious This is the perfect meal for most any occasion, but especially when you’re craving a healthy, hearty lunch or dinner.

0,Lentil Bolognese Zucchini Pasta,"Zucchini Pasta with Lentil Bolognese (30 minutes!)  Raise your hand if you’re always three years behind trends like me (wave it around, girl). I’m still trying to figure out whether it’s cool or notto wearflare jeans. Please advise in the comments. Veggie noodles have been a “thing” since like 2007, but I’m just now getting on board. Who wants tospiralize things with me?!  Here’s the thing about spiralized noodles. It requires a tool, as in another thingto have lyingaround your kitchen and we tend to be anti “stuff.” We like to keep our kitchen minimal, as you might’ve guessed.(Get it, Minimalist Baker? Sensing a trend? You’re quick, I knew you’d get it.) However, when your pal sends you her newcookbook and your very own spiralizer to try out, you kind of sort of have to use it. And since the rest of the free world seems to have one in their kitchen – including my mom, my sister, and probably all of my aunts – it’s about time I geton board. The cool thing about spiralizing noodles – besides vegetables morphing into curly q’s – isthat there are options: You can buy a countertop spiralizer, Ahandheld spiralizer, Or use a good old-fashioned vegetable peeler like I’ve done for the past several years. And when in doubt, just use pasta. You simply can’t lose with pasta.  This recipe comes together in 30 minutes, you guys. That’s big! Just think: aflavorful, hearty, protein- and fiber-rich dinner on the table in half an hour. Anyone can do it! Even you. Yes, you. You know I’m talking to you. The marinarais hearty and rich, and includes carrots for texture and natural sweetness and lentils for plant-based protein (nearly 20 g protein per serving!). Serve over fresh or lightly sautéed zucchini noodles and you’re good to go.  I hope you all LOVE this meal! It’s: Light Fresh Easy Flavorful Hearty Protein-packed Vegetable forward &amp; Crazy delicious Make this on nights when you need something hearty and healthy on the table when you don’t have a ton of time to spare. Or when you’re hosting folks with sensitive diets and need to please a crowd. Or just because. This dish is sogood it’s likely going to becomea mainstay in our dinner rotation.

0,Coconut Red Chickpea Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Red Curry with Chickpeas  Could there possibly be too many curries in the world? I say, no. I’ve been super intored curries lately for their spicy, smoky kick. And because chickpeas lend so beautifully to spicy sauces, they are my protein of choice here. Shall we dig in?  This curry is inspired by one I’ve been ordering from a local Thai shop in our new neighborhood. There’s nothing a little papaya salad, spring rolls, and curry won’t fix after a long day. It’s been our go-to Sunday routine as of late. (I’m not mad about it.) This recipe is simple, requiring just 1 pot and 30 minutesto prepare! Plus, the ingredients are simple and versatile. Don’t have eggplant? Omit or sub for mushrooms or zucchini. Don’t have bamboo shoots? Leave ’em out. Looking for more protein? Be sure to include the green peas, which provide 8 grams per cup!  I hope you guys love this curry! It’s: Simple Quick Creamy Vegetable-packed Savory-sweet Subtly spiced Super satisfying &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect weeknight mealwhen you’re craving something hearty but are short on time.

0,20-minute Asian Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Salad,"20-minute Asian Kale Salad  I recently tried doing an elimination diet – emphasis on the “tried.” I think I lasted about oneweek, but one foodI did manage to do was avoid soy. During that time, I discovereda way to do Asian food without tamari or soy sauce. Exciting, right? Allow me to demonstrate.  A local grocery store in Portland has this amazing kale “slaw” with carrots and cabbage, and I’ve basically been living off of it for the past month. It’s the easiest thingto reach into therefrigerator and grab to make quick salads, scrambles, or bowls. And I’ve made my own version for the base of this salad. The amazing part of this 20-minute recipeis the dressing. It’s a simple mix of cashew butter, chili garlic sauce, maple syrup, and sesame oil (meaning it’s soy-free!). A sprinkle of salt (or tamari) adds a bit of saltiness if needed, but I usually skip! It’s a gorgeous bright orange hue, creamy, and spicy-sweet (my favorite).  This salad makes a delicious snack or side, but to make it an entrée, I added some miso-roasted crispychickpeas! That’s right, I did a little internet research and found a few tips for making chickpeas super crispy and crunchy.   I hope you all LOVE this salad! It’s: Crunchy Savory Spicy Fast Healthy Satisfying &amp; Delicious This is the perfect salad to pack for lunches, picnics, or when you’re craving a light but satisfying meal.

0,Watermelon Sashimi | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Watermelon Sashimi  Do you ever look at foods and wonder what else they could be? I do it all the time. That’s how I comeup with recipes likeVegan “Pulled Pork” Sandwiches, Vegan Pepperoni, Eggplant Queso, and Quinoa Brittle. I think it’s limiting to think of foods as only being enjoyed one way. Such is the case with watermelon. Think big, people. It isn’t just meant to be cubed and enjoyed at BBQs (although, absolutely delicious). What if you turned it into “sashimi”?  Just looking at watermelon it has the same hue as tuna or salmon. Kind of weird, right? The texture may be different, but its color and flavor lend to a fun application of sashimi. This plant-based version is oh-so much fun.Plus, it onlyrequires7 ingredients and 10 minutes! Simply slice watermelon into triangles, wick awaysome of the moisture, and brush with a sesame-tamari glaze. A little wasabi adds a kick, which I thoroughly enjoy with sushi.  Toppings can be modified to what sounds best to you, but to keep things simple I went with avocado, red onion and pickled ginger. A few sesame seeds (black or white) add a nice pop of color and tiny crunch.  I hope you all LOVE this sashimi! It’s: Fresh Satisfying Salty-sweet Crisp Refreshing &amp; So delicious This makes theperfect summer afternoon or pre-dinner snack. In fact, if I had friends over for Portobello Stir-Fry,Peanut Butter Tofu Stir-Fry, or Brown Rice Sushi, I might just serve this as an appetizer.

The base of this bowl is my go-to parsley, tomato, and onion salad with a simple dressing of lemon juice, olive oil, and sea salt. It takes 5 minutes and I make it at least once a week for falafel night. Yes, we have falafel night and it’s the highlight of my week. Don’t judge.

(Are you sensing a theme? I like shawarma.) In most situations, my 4-ingredient Garlic Dill sauce is where it’s at. It’s lemony, herby, and packed with tons of fresh garlic flavor. Recently, however, I’ve been reaching for something more subdued, especially when it comes to myfalafel addiction. Enter: 3-Ingredient Tahini Sauce for Everything.  This sauce was inspired by Wolf + Bear in Portland (one of my favorite food carts!), which has me hooked on falafel salads with tahini dressing (and Tahini Bombs!). Upon investigating thetexture and flavor of theirsauce, I realized how simple it really was. Consider thismy inspired version.  This recipe couldn’t get any easier. Sprinkle a little salt and garlic powder on tahini and whisk. Then add water and whisk. THAT’S IT. It’s hardly a recipe but it’s too good and simple not to share.

0,No-Bake Almond Butter Cup Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Almond Butter Cup Bars  We recently made a trip back to Kansas to visit family and friends and during our stayI got to hang out with my pal, Laura, who is my kindred spirit who also eats gluten-free, is super into baking, and even crafted this fine Gluten Free Pizza Crust Recipe. Isn’t she a gem? We were passing through a health food store, checking out their wares, when I spotted a Hail Merry almond butter tarton the top shelf. The tart and I locked eyes, and I immediately knew its destiny: my stomach. So I snatched one up andwepromptly devoured it. This is my inspired version.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 basic ingredients and 20 minutes to make! The chocolate date-nut crust is adapted from my No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecakes. The filling is justalmond butter mixed with a little sea salt and maple syrup. And the top layeris a simplified version of my 2-ingredient Dark Chocolate Truffles! What’s not to love?   The reason I love these bars so much – besides the fact that they come togetherin 20 minutes – is the salty-sweet combo. My favorite desserts have always struck a balance between salty and sweet (which explains my obsession with Snickers), and this recipe is no different. Plus,they’re naturally sweetened (aside from the dark chocolate ganache), and chock-full of protein and fiber thanks to the nuts and almondbutter. Serious love for these gems.

0,Berry Smoothie Bowl | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Go-To Smoothie Bowl (5 minutes!)  Lately I’ve been a bit obsessed with smoothie bowls (or as I call them, smoodie bowls). The concept is simple and I’ve done it before here and here! But I believe this is my best version yet, and the trick is all in the blending method. Come see how!  This recipe only requires 3 ingredients, 1 blender,and 5 minutes. Huzzah! Simply addfrozen bananas andfrozen mixed berries to a blender and blend on low (this is key!) until it looks like Dip ‘n’ Dots (remember those?!). Then add a little (not too much!) non-dairy milk of choice – I like coconut – and protein powder if you’d like. Blend some more on low, scraping down the sides until you have SOFT SERVE! Yes, a smoothie bowl is glorified soft serve and it’s so dang delicious. Hence the reason I can’t stop.  The best part about smoothie bowls is the toppings. I’ve been keeping it super simple recently and adding a spoonfuleach coconut flake, hemp seeds,and chia seeds for added nutrients, fiber, and protein. Fruit makes a pretty addition but isn’t necessary since the entire bowl is made of fruit.  This recipe is so simple, but I hope you give it a try and love it!

Ever since I discovered the trick of quick-soaking chickpeasinstead of using canned chickpeas to make the perfect falafel, my mind is spinning with applications. Don’t worry. This is the firstexperiment of many. This 10-ingredient version uses chickpeas as a base and is infused with sun-dried tomatoes for a savory, sweet tomato flavor, which is balanced with fresh garlic and herbs (parsley or basil).

0,Vegan Pepperoni | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pepperoni  If you follow me on snapchat (@minimalistbaker), you know I’ve been trying to make vegan pepperoni for a while now. It’s been one of those recipes I dreamed up and then struggled to perfect. But, after many failedattempts, I’m happy to report I cracked the code! Say goodbye to the days of vegetables-only pizza (not that there’s anything wrong with that). Vegan pepperoni to the rescue!  For the base, I experimented with tofu, tempeh, and chickpeas, tryingeach individuallyand mixed to find the right texture. While tempeh seemed to yield the right texture initially, when baked it gets pretty dry and crumbly. The same goes for chickpeas. Tofu, however, lends itself perfectly to the texture of pepperoni because it bakes up beautifully and holds it shape! Plus, it’s neutral in flavor and does an excellent job at absorbingall of those pepperonispices. In total, this recipe requires just 10 ingredients and comes together in less than 1 hour! Some versionsI tested required more than 1 full day to prepare, but I knew that wasn’t realistic. I think it’s pretty awesome that you canmake this pepperoni from scratch for dinner tonight! (Pats self on back).  What spices will you need? Excellent question! A blend of sea salt, black pepper, red pepper flake, paprika, garlic powder, ground anise, fennel (this one’s important!), ground mustard, and coconut sugar for a little sweetness. Ididn’t have all of these spices onhand, but now that I have them, I can’t wait to experiment with other uses.  In addition to being relatively easy to make, these pepperoni are considerably healthier than their animal-based counterpart. They’re very low in fat – less than 1 gram fat per pepperoni – and relatively high in protein – about 1 gram protein per pepperoni! If you ate all the pepperonis (like I did), that would be 30 g protein. That’s a lot of plant-based fuel!  I hope you all try and love this recipe! It’s: Spicy Hearty Smoky Salty Perfectly tender +crisp &amp; Seriously delicious This is the perfect topper for vegan and gluten-free pizzas, as well as deep dish, portobello, and butternut! I could also see these tucking beautifully inside of calzones! The options are endless. I just love that the texture is so close to the real thing, and they’re addictively salty and spicy.

Let’s BBQ!  My first attempt at vegan pulled pork was successful after jumping on the jackfruit train. I loved it so much that I created a spicier version topped with grilled pineapple forour cookbook! Serious swoon. While I love using jackfruit as a vegan meat substitute, it has little to no protein. So after making my Vegan Sloppy Joes with lentils I was inspired to try a BBQ flavor. As you might’ve guessed, experimentationwent well. This may be my favorite lentil recipe yet!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients, and it comes together in less than 45 minutes! You likely have everything you need on hand besides BBQ sauce and buns (unless you’re like me and hoard these things in your pantry). To infuse the lentils and shredded carrots – which add that amazing, stringy texture – with flavor, I relied on smoked paprika, coconut sugar, garlic powder, and sea salt. A little BBQ sauce sealed the deal forthat quintessential smoky BBQ flavor.   I hope you guys LOVE this recipe! It’s: Hearty Satisfying Smoky BBQ-infused Packed with protein + fiber Easy &amp; So delicious Even better news? One of four sandwichesboasts 17 grams of protein, making this the perfect plant-based version that will truly satisfy those hearty pulled pork cravings.

0,Tahini Stuffed Dates | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tahini-Stuffed Dates (aka Tahini Bombs!)  Whoa. That’s all I have to say about these babes. The inspiration for these Tahini-Stuffed Dates came from two places: 1)A local restaurant 2) My 5-ingredient Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Snowballs from the March Bonus Recipe (viewed only by email subscribers!) Get your taste buds ready. We’re going for a ride.  Inspiration struck after trying Wolf &amp;Bear’s “bunny balls,” which areessentially a date truffle with tahini and cacao powder. Because the flavors weren’t as pronounced as I’d like, I decidedto deconstruct them. I kept the dates whole, stuffed each one with as much tahini as possible (almost 1 teaspoon each!), and then dunked them in myEasy Vegan Chocolate, which is naturally sweetened to taste and absolutely perfect for these tahini bombs. I just like saying tahini bombs. Can you tell?  If you’re intimidated by makingchocolate, don’tbe. If I can do it, you can do it. It does require cocoa butter, which is super easy to work with and also featured in my White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecakes, Easy Vegan Chocolate, and Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons. What I’m saying is: Invest in a block and it won’t go to waste around here (wink wink). Not to worry if you can’t procurecocoa butter though – I include a workaround in the notes.   These dates require just 8 ingredients and about 30 minutes to make. They’re ready to enjoy right away, or can be frozen or refrigerated to keep fresh up to 1 month. In other words, a little effort for a lot of reward.  I think you guys are going to FLIP over these tahini dates!

0,Classic Vegan Falafel (Gluten-Free) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Classic Vegan Falafel (GF)  How many falafel recipes can one person have on their blog? Five. The answer is five. Proof:1–2–3–4. Either I’ve lost my mind or I’m getting really good at making falafel. Fingers crossed it’s the latter.  We’ve been exploringour new Portlandneighborhood for about a month now, and we’re getting to know our favorite food spots (very important on ourlist of priorities). One place I’m loving is Wolf and Bear, which serves up vegetarian and vegan Middle Easternfood with lots of gluten-free options. My go-to has been the gomasio salad with falafel. You can add two but I ask for three, because obviously. Now that I’ve had this falafel a few times, I’ve studied its flavors and texture and was convincedit was time to up my falafel game. I think you know where this is going.  This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and isexpedited with the help of a quick-soak chickpea method I borrowed from The Kitchn. The primary differences between this recipe and my previous attempts are that I start with dry chickpeas, and instead of baking, they’repan-fried – two improvements I believe make all the difference.  The ingredients are so simple, andthe flavors are complex and wonderful. Soaked chickpeas are blended with onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, cardamom, coriander, and sea salt. A little oat flour keeps these gluten free while also helping them bind/form into a dough.After letting the mixturechill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, simply form into balls or discs and pan fry.Look at the crispy, golden perfection. Swoon! Find my selection of go-to sauces in the instructions. We hope you love these falafel. If you try them, let us know what you think!

0,Vegan Milky Way | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Milky Way  There was a point in time whenmy love for Milky Waysurpassedmy love for Snickers. I know – it was a major shock to me, too. Somehow, I managed to find room in my heart for one more candy bar. I guess, if I were to admitmy one fault, it’s that I love too much…(candy).  This recipe has been bouncing around in my head for a while now – the challenging part being the nougat. I already knewhow to whip up a mean date caramel (pats shoulder) and melt chocolate (pats other shoulder), but the perfect nougat had eluded me…until now. This 6-ingredient, 30-minute recipestarts with a date-based nougat that’s so easy I don’t know how I didn’t think of it before. Can you find it in your candy-loving heart to forgive me? Please say yes, please say yes.  Dates are blended into a sticky ball, and then coconut flour and almond flour transform it into a perfect, moldable dough that takes on the flavor and characteristics of a (terrible-for-you, corn-syrup-laden) nougat. That’s what I call 4-ingredient magic. Next comes date caramel. And lastly, melted chocolate with a dash of coconut oil to ensure it’s the perfect consistency for dipping. We’re getting close. Can you feel it?  I know you guys are going to LOVE these bars! They’re: Tender Chocolaty Caramel-stuffed Triple-layered Super rich Easy to make &amp; Healthified candy at its finest These are the perfect treat to make when yourmost intense junk food craving strikes and you need a healthier fix, quick! They come together in about 30 minutes and last for up to 1 month in the freezer! Enjoy them one bar at a time or, if you’re like me, remove a bar from the freezer 5 times throughoutthe day and cut off small bites to make you “feel better” until the whole bar is gone (insert sneaky eyes emoji).

0,Asian Quinoa Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Asian Quinoa Salad (30 minutes!)  Transition. It’s exciting. It’sscary. It’s a challenge. We moved into our first home a few weeks backand are starting to feel a little settled. Just this week, we finally have a couch to sit on (little victories!). The move was fairly painless, but I always findthat figuring out how you fit in a new space is the challengingpart. We have a kitchen that fits morethan one person, new windows that invitedifferentlighting,new angles to work around. I’m feeling more at home one day and one recipe at a time. This was the first blog recipe in our new space, and I wanted to document it so I’d remember what was going on in my head and in our kitchen during thisnew season of life.  Do you ever see an image thatinspires you to act in some way? This is how the inspiration struckfor this 30-minute Asian-inspired salad. I don’t remember where but in passing I saw a photo of an Asian-looking salad with quinoa and some savory-sweet looking dressing. YUM, must act. Must have.The rest is history.  The base of this beautiful, crunchy, satisfying salad is protein-rich quinoa, which cooks up in about 25 minutes while the rest of the magic happens. Steam broccoli and edamame. Shred cabbage.

0,Vegan Nicoise Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Nicoise Salad (30 minutes!)  I’m 12 days away from turning 30. I despise public speaking, but sometimes,I do it anyway. Summer is my favorite. My hair is short, but I wish it werelong. Life is still good. My husband is the best. I wake up every morning in our new house pinching myself over how beautiful it is. I miss my mom and my dad. Watermelon is my favorite. Farmers markets are life. This salad? Also life. Shall we?  You guys know that turning dishesplant-based is my jam, so this salad has beena long time coming. This salad was inspired by oneI had a while backwhen we were in France. We’d stopped at a cafe in Nimes and I ordereda Nicoise salad that was quite possibly the best I’d ever had – and probably ever will have – in my life. Nicoise salads are named for theNicoise olives that adorn them, which can be found at most grocery stores (check the olive bar). Truth be told, any quality olive will do – especially green and kalamata.  Simple perks? You betcha. Just 30 minutes required with a little fancy pants multi-tasking. Blanch green beans while boiling potatoes. Mash chickpeas then make dressing. A little of this, a little of that.

0,Carrot Orange Juice | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super-Powered Orange Juice  While on vacation recently I read a book I enjoyedso much, I read it twice. That’s saying a lot for a girl who used to despise reading. The book iscalled Modern Rapunzelby Jeanne Powers. The cover looks a little bizarre andout of touch, but don’t let that fool you. Itboasts a ton of information about women’s health and natural beauty, especially for hair and skin (my top two concerns when it comes to aging gracefully – fingers crossed as 30 approaches).  In the book, Jeanne sharesabout atime when she gotvery sick and suffered from hair lossas a result, and she nursed herself back to healthwithnatural remedies, includingcarrot juice. This is my kind of lady. Carrots are loaded withbeta carotene which doeswonders forthe body and fights off disease-causing free radicals. They’realso extremely high in Vitamins A, B, C, E and K, magnesium, potassium and calcium, and havebeen found to fight inflammation, relieve congestion, andprotect eyesight and brain function among many other benefits. All of these vitamins and minerals boast a tonof benefits for yourskin and hair. Naturally, they’re my new best friend.  I’m not typically a big juice fan because I prefer smoothies and the fiber they provide. But, for carrots, I make exceptions. While I was reading this book, we were on vacation in Healdsburg, California, home to a beautiful restaurant calledShed. Their coffee shop offered two fresh daily juices: one green and one orange. The orange boasted carrots. I was in. I enjoyedan orange juice almost every day we were there, and I’ve since been making my own inspired version at home. Get ready for some good, healthy fun, kids.  This 6-ingredient, 10-minute (juicer-free!) juice is based with carrots and naturally sweetened with orange, nectarine, and apple. Lemon juice adds brightness, and ginger some zing (and anti-inflammatory perks, yo). Mint is optional for an earthy, minty vibe. Do it – you know you want to. I hope you guys love this beauty elixir. It’s extremely simple, easy to make, loaded with vitamins and minerals, super delicious, and my new go-to morning beverage. If you give it a try, let us know what you think!

0,Sunflower Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Seedy Sunflower Butter  Sunflower butter. God’s gift to those who cannot have nuts (moment of silence for this delicious treattheincredible hand is modeling).  Although I can have nuts, I have a tendency to overdo it on almond butter (raise hands if you go through 1 jar a week). Recently, I’ve been enjoying cashew butter and sunflower butter. However, I’ve noticed that many of the sunflower butter brands include added sugar and it ends up being too sweet for my taste. So I wanted to make my own version that I felt better about enjoying every day.  This 6-ingredient, 20-minute sunflower butter gets a serious nutritional boost fromhemp seeds, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds and chia seeds! Theynot only add essential amino acids, protein, fiber, healthy fats, and more, but also a nutty crunch to this creamy spread. Speaking of spread, what do you spread this butter on?

Another favorite? The burrito bowl. It’s the first thing I cravewhen we come home from a long trip. It’s fast, easy, healthy, delicious. Ihave my classic take on the 30-minute burrito bowl in our print cookbook (!!). And after trying my hand at Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers (!!) recently, I knew a faster, inspired version of the same meal was in order. I think you know what happened next. (Hint: this deliciousness.)  The base is cauliflower rice, which gets steamed slightly on the stovetop and then packedwith flavor thanks tosalsa, cilantro, lime juice, and spices. I could eat that for lunch on its own, but wait, there’s more.  Guacamole is optional, but the black beans and sautéed peppers and onions are not. This pairing adds plenty of plant-based protein and fiber, vitamins and minerals, and not to mentiontons of flavor. Yes, please.  I hope you guys love this 30-minute, vegan, GF dinner! It’s: Fast Easy Flavorful Veggie-packed Protein- and fiber-rich Super healthy Crowd-pleasing &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect meal when you want something substantial but healthy on the table fast (story of my life).

0,Lime Pie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Lime Pie Bars  These creamy lime pie bars are inspired by my Creamy Lemon Bars, which have become a fan favorite since I shared them in February. I made a few slight adjustments, but they’re still just as simple and delicious as the original, only playing on the tart flavor of limes.  The base is my favorite nut-oat crust that ends up tasting like a nutty graham cracker – I know, it’s magic. And the filling is a blend of soaked cashews, coconut cream, lime juice and zest, arrowroot for thickening, and maple syrup for sweetness. All in all, this recipe requires just 10 simple ingredients.  The filling bakes into a custard-like texture that’s so temptingly delicious you’ll want to scoop right in. But, wait for them to chill before slicingfor the best results. I hope you all love these Lime Pie Bars! They’re: Creamy Rich Summery Citrusy Naturally sweet &amp; Absolutely satisfying Make these bars for entertaining or to have on hand throughout the week as a healthier dessert.

0,Healthy and Delicious Fig Newtons | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Fig Newtons (GF)  This recipe is a reader request (yay!!). Plus,it’s actually one I’ve been meaning to take a swing at for a while now because fig newtons are kind of my jam. I remember being able to get away with eating fig newtons as a kid because they were a “healthier” cookie. Well, at least healthierthan my soft batch chocolate chip cookie addiction. Oy. Healthier options, for the win.  These cookies are easy to make, requiring just 8ingredients! Plus, they’re naturally sweetened and no-bake (with the exception of toasting your oats and nuts before blending). The filling is a simple blend of dried figs, cinnamon, dates, and orange zest. And the outer cookie is made of almonds, pecans, oats, and dates.  The result is a perfectly tender, sweet, fig-stuffed cookie that is greatfor snacking, refueling, or when you need a healthier dessert. If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Rice Stuffed Peppers  Oh the wonders of cauliflower rice. Perfect in stir fries, arancini, curries… The options are endless. It was only a matter of time before I stuffed it inside peppers and called it dinner. (And spoiler alert: It’s oh-so delicious.)  This recipe was inspired by my classic Quinoa Stuffed Peppers. I made them for dinner one recent evening, and several bites in, I speculated as to whether a grain-free version would be doable. To the drawing board I went.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 basicingredients and easy methods that yieldbig, flavorful results. A head of cauliflower is shredded into ‘rice’ and sautéed lightly with green onion (garlic is optional). Then add beans, salsa, lime juice, and plenty of smoky spices to create a savory filling that’s perfect when stuffed into sweet bell peppers. (I’m getting hungry all over again.)  Another perk of this recipe? It could easily be made ahead of time. Simply prepare up untilthe point of baking, refrigerate, and then bake when you need it. Even if you don’t have time to prep beforehand, the whole thing comes together in about 1 hourwith just 15minutes of hands-on prep time. That gives you plenty of time to whip upa margarita (or two), prepare my Creamy Cilantro Sauce (if you dare)for serving,and read a book (or whatever brings a thrill to your evening). See? Dinner can bethat easy.  I hope you all love this recipe! It’s: Simple Savory Healthy Vegetable- + fiber-packed Rich in protein (nearly 10 g protein per serving!) Entirely plant-based + gluten-free &amp; So delicious Stuffed peppers are great for servinga mixed crowd because they’re so filling and flavorful that no one will miss the meat.

0,S'mores Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"S’mores Bars (Vegan + GF)  I know. S’mores BARS! This is real life, people. No more talking– let’s do this.  This recipe was conceived after having possibly the best dessert of my life (BIG words) at Solstice in Hood River(which also inspired this lovely Pear Salad!). Solstice serves up a gluten free s’mores dessert in a skillet and it is absolute perfection. One bite in and I started taking notes. The crust was homemade and more like a granola mixture than graham cracker. The chocolate layer was a ganache/pudding hybrid. And the marshmallow topping was insanely fluffy, sweet, and definitely homemade. So good I couldn’t quit taking giant spoonfuls. This is my inspired version that comes together in less than 1 hour with just 10 ingredients!  For the crust I went with my go-to almond-oat crust and threw in some pecans for more texture. The filling is a modification of myfavorite chocolate ganache. And to keep things easy, I went with my new favorite vegan, gluten-free marshmallows: Dandies! So good you can’t tell the difference between them and the ‘real thing.’ Friends, these bars are magic. They’re: Crispy on the bottom Chocolaty in the middle Fluffy and toasted on top Perfectly sweet Rich Satisfying &amp; So summery Thinks’mores but on a whole other level. Plus, they’re easy to make and are a great way to keep this summer classic both vegan and gluten free! If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Pear Balsamic Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pear Salad with Dried Cherries and Candied Walnuts  Every once in a while, a restaurant salad catches me off guard and I set off to investigate how it’s made. I ask the server where the ingredients are from and what’s in the dressing and what makes it so…extra delicious? One such salad inspired this 30-minute recipe, and it lives at Solstice Pizza in Hood River, Oregon – a must-visit if you’re ever in the Portland area and cravingsome killer gluten-free, vegan pizza.  The concept is easy, but it’s all in the texture and flavor combinations. The base is gorgeous mixed greens. The fruit is tender, ripe pear. Dried cherries add a slight chew and tartness. Super simple candied walnuts add crunch, nuttiness, and subtle sweetness. And it’s all tossed in a tangy, 4-ingredient balsamic vinaigrette.   The result is a super fresh, semi-sweet salad with layers of flavor and texture. This is the perfect entrée when you want something healthy but filling! It would also make a deliciousside to dishes likepizza, pasta, or veggie burgers this summer. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Quinoa Taco Meat | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Taco Meat  Were you a picky eater as a kid? I was (kind of).When it came to fruit I rememberonly likingcanned pears (yeah, weird, I know). Lunch was almost always a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and dinner was often cheese and shells. If my parents put creamed corn on the table, it was a guaranteed meltdown (hated the stuff). Desserts on the other hand? So easy to please, so long as coconut flake, cherries, or raisins weren’t involved. Another menu itemI could always get behind? Tacos. My family lovedcrispy tacos with ground beef and lots of salsa. My favorite thing to do was mix in some corn tothe filling – I know, classy move. You don’t have to tell me how refined my palate was at 6 years old.  These days, ground beef isn’t my go-to filling for tacos. But sometimes the 6-year-old in me misses itscrumbly texture and flavor. I think you see where this is going. Quinoa makes an excellent substitution! It’s almost uncanny. Come see how.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and simple methods. Preparequinoa, season with spices and salsa, bake until crispy, devour. See? I told you it was easy. I got the idea for this recipe when I made my Spanish Stuffed Peppers for dinner one nightand some of the quinoa spilled over in the pan and got all crispy and delicious while baking – I couldn’t get enough. That was mylight bulb moment.   I hope you all LOVE this recipe! It’s: Easy Healthy Extremely flavorful Picky-eater-approved Versatile Satisfying &amp; So delicious This is the perfect filling for all your Mexican night needs: Tacos, burrito bowls (find my 30-minute recipe in our Everyday Cooking Cookbook!), taco salads, nachos, enchiladas, tostadas (also in the cookbook) – you name it, it works!

0,Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream  I’ve been on a mission to create creamy, rich vegan chocolate ice cream, and it almost stumped me. Myfirst attempt lackeddepth ofdark chocolate flavor. My second attempt came closer, but lackedcreaminess. And my third attempt? Total winner. Creamy, insanely rich chocolate flavor that’s somewhere between ice cream and gelato. Get your ice cream maker, kids. We’re doin’ this.  This recipe requires just 6 ingredients and simple methods. If you can whisk, blend, and pour into an ice cream maker, you can master this easy recipe. The base is comprised of water, cocoa powder, rich coconut cream, and organic cane sugar, which is whisked together. Then comes the deep chocolate flavor: from plenty of vegan dark chocolate. The last ingredient is vanilla extract, which enhances the flavor and helps prevent ice crystals (because of the alcohol content). Then simply blend, chill, and wait patiently until it’s time to churn.   This ice cream is insanely creamyand so, so rich in chocolate flavor. It satisfied that craving I had for the chocolate ice cream I enjoyedback in my dairy-eating days. This will make the perfect treat to have on hand this summer for snacking or for hosting. I highly recommend serving this with fresh strawberries and coconut whipped cream. And whoops, what if a raw brownie falls in the bowl? Bliss.   If you try this recipe, let us know!

This pie is pretty much amazing and it’s easy to make, requiring just10 basic ingredients and simple methods.

0,Rhubarb Strawberry Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Rhubarb Strawberry Margaritas  If you’vefollowed the blog for a while, you know I have a thing for margaritas. I love how tart and sweet they are, and tequila happens to be one of my favorite liquors. Plus, they pair perfectly with Mexican food. Need I say more?  This recipe was inspired by spring. It’s definitely feeling like spring going on summer here in the Northwest. The days have been getting sunnier and longer, which means I can sleep in, get to work later, and still get all of my work done sincethe sun doesn’t go down until 7. Can’t it be this way all year round? I wish. Besides the beautiful weather, one of the reasons I love spring so much is the produce! Specifically, rhubarb. So when I was atthe grocery store recently and spotted a beautiful bushel of rhubarb, I knew it was time for some serious recipe development. Margaritas it was.  These margaritas are made with 6 simple ingredients, are low in sugar per serving, and celebrate the natural earthy sweetness of rhubarb and strawberry. The first step is to make a rhubarb strawberry “syrup” with water, fruit, organic cane sugar, and a little orange juice. Let itsimmer until almost liquid, and then drain until you have a beautiful, vibrant fruit syrup.  Once cooled, it’s time for happy hour. Add a bit of your syrup to a cocktail shaker with lime juice, silver tequila, agave nectar, and ice (that’s it!) and shake it like you mean it. Serve over ice with a salted rim for flavor contrast (my favorite) or a sugar rim for more sweetness.  I think you’re going to LOVE this margarita! It’s: Slightly tart Not too sweet Strawberry-rhubarb infused Boozy Refreshing &amp; Seriously delicious I think this would make the perfect afternoon or evening cocktail for warmer weather when you want something fruity and light. It’s amazing on its own, but I also think it would pairdeliciously with pretty much any Mexican dish, especially nachos, salads, and veggie burgers! If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir-Fry  I realized something lately. The blog does not have nearly enough stir-fries considering how much I enjoy them. I view stir-fries as the easiest, tastiestway to use up whatever produce you have on hand. Just serve over quinoa or brown rice and you havea seriously hearty, vegetable-packed, nutritious meal. When I want something super hearty, I look no further than portobello mushrooms.  Can I tell you a secret? My absolute favoriteportobello mushroom recipe at the moment is in our 31 Meals eCookbook (which has been recently updated to be entirely plant-based!). Think juicy portobello burgers with a creamy vegan garlic aioli sauce. It’s so good my eyes rolled back in my head whenI took my first bite. Since then, my affection for portobellos has grown into full blown obsession. I had to put them in a stir-fry – there was no question.  This stir fry requires 10 basic ingredientsand comes together in about 30 minutes! The marinade is the perfect balance of savory, citrusy, and sweet. And the mushrooms soak it all up and get incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Once your portobellos have had a few minutes to marinate, it’s onto the stovetop, where they get a sear on both sides and begin to slightly caramelize. Oh mama.  For vegetables, I went with red bell pepper and broccolini. But I think you could use pretty much anything you have on hand!This isa very flexible, adaptable recipe that delivers big on flavor. I hope you love this stir fry! It’s: Hearty Flavorful Vegetable-packed Healthy Simple &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect plant-based meal when you’re craving something heartybut healthy.

But it’s very affordable to make at home. Plus, you can customize your fillings and create your dream veggie roll.Let me show you how.  If you don’t have a sushi mat, I’ve got you covered. Check out our How to Make Sushi Without a Mat tutorial. But because they’re so affordable and make the process more streamlined, I picked up a mat for this version. It may look complicated, but sushi is truly easy tomake. I compare it to rolling spring rolls. Sure, your first few are a little imperfect. But once you get the hang of it, it’s so easy and you feel incredibly accomplished making your own restaurant-worthy food at home. All in all, this sushi requires just 10 simple ingredients (more or less depending on your fillings of choice) and comes together in less than 1 hour.  It starts with wholesome brown rice that’s mixed with a vinegar mixture to sweeten it slightly and make it sticky so it’s easier to work with. I tested it without the vinegar mixture, and trust me, it did not gowell. You need the rice to be sticky so it forms a roll.  For fillings I went with roasted red pepper,cucumber,sprouts, and carrots. I also love veggie rolls with avocado, asparagus, radish, and pickled veggies. Dream big, friends. The options are endless.  I hope you all love this recipe!

0,Crispy Baked Vegan Tacos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Tacos with Pineapple Salsa  When one masters the art of cooking beans from scratch (go me!), one must find delicious things to do with said beans. And the thing my mind instantly goes to is tacos.  Did you ever have crispy tacos growing up? That was one of my favorite meals. Crispy taco shells with tons offillings that always,always involved corn and cheese. As you can tell,little Dana liked her carbs and dairy. But instead of frying the shells, I figured out a simple way to bake them and get them crispy! Simply fold the edges over a baking sheet and bake on top of a second baking sheet. Or, rest mini cupcake liners inside a folded over soft tortilla and bake until crispy and golden (see image below)! Yes, it’s that easy. And the whole recipe comes together in just 30 minutes.  For fillings, I immediately knew I wanted to go for my Mexican Pinto Beans from Scratch (made in 1 pot).

These set surprisingly fast, and, thanks to cocoa butter, they can set out at room temperature without “melting” for much longer thantraditional raw cheesecakes.  At room temperature, these cheesecakes arean absolute dream – super creamy and rich with tons of white chocolate macadamia nut flavor. If you so choose to accept the mission, upgrade them with the addition ofcoconut whipped cream, toasted coconut, fresh raspberries, andmacadamia nuts.

0,Mexican Pinto Beans | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Pinto Beans From Scratch (1 Pot)  Can I admit something? I had only cooked beans from scratch once before testingthis recipe. And that’s because I’m not usually the type to prep dinners hours ahead of time, or make large quantities of food for later use. However,I recognize the merit in cooking your own beans from scratch. For starters, alot of canned products are heavy in salt and often contain preservatives and other additives (such as BPA) that aren’t so great for you in large quantities. Not to mention, cooking your own beans is considerably cheaper, making it far more cost effective than buying canned. Plus, it’s seriously simple. If I can do it, you can do it. Let me show you how!  This recipe is simple to make requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 pot to prepare. Manytraditional Mexican pinto bean recipes require bacon or ham hocks to prepare, but to keep mine plant-based, I relied on vegetable broth, garlic, onion, and diced tomatoes and green chilies. And foreven more flavor, I addedchili powder, cumin, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Hands-on prep time is really only 15-20 minutes, sincethe soaking and cooking take place while you do other things. The brilliant thing is this recipe yields about 5 cups cooked pinto beans, which you can enjoy throughout the week for super easy, quick meals. Oryou can store leftovers in freezer-safe bags or jars to savefor future meals.  I think you guys are going to love these easy, 1-Pot beans. They’re: Smoky Hearty Tender Flavorful Perfectly spiced Satisfying &amp; Delicious These beans are great on their own as a snack with guacamole and chips (hello, lunch).

This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients to prepare, and it comes together in a little over an hour.  The sauce is cashew-based and supereasy to make. Simply soak cashews and blend with garlic, cream cheese, nutritional yeast, and cumin! The result is a creamy, cheesy, smoky, Mexican-inspired cheese that perfectly complements the corn and jalapeño.  I hope you all love this dip! It’s: Creamy Cheesy Spicy from the jalapeño Sweet from the corn Simple Summer-friendly Satisfying &amp; Delicious This dip would make the perfect appetizer or side dish on Mexican night, and would be especially great for summer BBQs since it can be made ahead of time and heated up before serving.

0,Pineapple Cucumber Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pineapple Cucumber Smoothie  I’ve been takingcucumbers for granted as the boring, flavorless vegetable Ioccasionallydip myhummus in. That is, until recently when I rediscovered their impressive health benefits. Go grab a cucumber and let’s put half of it in a smoothie, and the other half on our face, shall we?  This 6-ingredient, 5-minute smoothie was inspired by the wonder food that is cucumber.

They’re also a secret weapon for nails and hair, thanks to the nutrient silica, which helps them grow strong and shiny. And because oftheir cooling and calming effect, they are excellent at calming stressedor sunburned skin and reviving puffy, dark under eyes – simply applyfresh sliced cucumber to soothe the affected area. So whether you’re consuming cucumber or putting it on your face, the benefits are real, people.  I hope you all love this smoothie! It’s: Refreshing Creamy Tart-sweet Super healthy Naturally detoxifying (thanks to fiber!)

In other words, this truly is an easy cheesecake that just also happens to be vegan, gluten-free,and refined-sugar-free. Hello, thank you, I’m Dana, you’re welcome.

0,The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac 'n' Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Vegan Gluten-Free Mac ‘n’ Cheese  We recently hosted a friend’s birthday party at our place and much to my surprise (and delight), they servedour Garlic Mac ‘n’ Cheese as one of the entrées. But here’s the thing: They made it completely gluten-free, and somehow, it tasted better than mine. Don’t you hate it when somebody does you better than you? Not me. I kind of love it. I learned something new! With afew simple swaps, I knew I’d stumbled upon what truly is thee best vegan, gluten-free mac ‘n’ cheese and I couldn’t help but share. Let’s do this!  This recipe is above all, simple. It comes together in about 1 hour (including roasting the garlic), and requires 8 simple ingredients. I’ve been eating mostly gluten-free lately, and in doing so I’ve discovered the pasta brand Bionaturae, whichI’m completely smitten with. Their penne tastes exactly like “real” gluten penne and doesn’t get gummy or have any weird taste! It truly does pass as the real deal.  The other news to report is arrowroot starch. I’ve been using arrowroot – a natural thickener – in things like my Vegan Lemon Curd to thicken sauces, but when I tried it in pasta sauce, the results were unreal. Are you guys seeing this? When you begin heating the sauce back up on the stovetop, it gets super thick and a little “stringy” like real cheese!It’s a Christmas miracle (in spring, no less).  The sauce is a classic roux, with the exception of the arrowroot starch, and olive oil in place of the butter. Itgets its flavor from vegan parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, and fresh and roasted garlic. The result is mac ‘n’ cheese perfection – no lie.  I hopeyou guys LOVE this pasta! It’s: Ultra creamy Super cheesy Savory Comforting Satisfying Simple &amp; Seriously the best Make this when you want to impress friends with an undetectably vegan and gluten-free pasta! It makes a great weeknight meal or one to save for weekend indulging. Our friends added sautéed kale when adding the pasta, which I loved! Definitely feel free to add in greens of choice for more nutritional benefits. If you give this a try, let us know!

0,Thai Kale Salad with Cashew Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gingery Thai Kale Salad with Cashew Dressing  In the colder months, you can typically find me bundledin a sweater, holed up inside, hoping for spring to arrive. Now that it’s officially here (at least in the Pacific Northwest), I’m absolutely thrilled. This is the time of year to get outside for my exercise, sit on patios, soak in the sun, and transition my diet to lighter foods instead of the hearty comfort dishes my body craves all winter. Let’s kick off the new season with a salad, shall we?  This salad was inspired by one that Itried while we were in San Diego. Though myinterpretation of it is quite different, the main elements remain: lots of ginger, super crunchy vegetables, and tons of flavor. This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes to prepare. And it’s full of good-for-you ingredients like kale, green beans, red pepper, cashews, sesame seeds, and carrots.  The dressing is cashew butter-based – a recent favorite of mine! Plus, I’ve recognized that not everyone can enjoy peanuts (sad, sad day) and it’s fun to switch it up sometimes. The result is a super creamy dressing infused with tamari (or soy sauce), lime juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, and sesame oil for a slightly nutty flavor.  I hope you all love this salad! It’s: Hearty Crunchy Vegetable-packed Easy to make Healthy Satisfying &amp; Perfect for spring Makethis salad when you’re craving something healthy yet filling for dinner. It’s ideal for preparingahead of time and bringing along to work or running errands (justkeep the dressing separate so the greens remain crunchy and fresh).

0,Vegan Lemon Curd | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Lemon Curd  A few weeks ago, we had a brunch with some friends and lemon curd was on the table. Lemon curd is sodelicious, but it’s sonot vegan-friendly. So I set off to make my own inspired version.  This 1-pot, 5-ingredient vegan lemon curd is like the real deal, and it’s delicious enough to eat right from the jar with a spoon – the sign of any good dessert. It’s also naturally sweetened and requires just 30 minutes hands-on prep time before going into the refrigerator to set and thicken.  The key to any good lemon curd is a ton of lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. The creative part came with the base ingredients. And for that I went with coconut cream for rich, creamy texture, and arrowroot starch to thicken. To sweeten naturally, I went with a little maple syrup. Oh man, so good. I imagine this would work well with lime juice and zest, too!   This curd is the real deal. It is slightly more white in color because there are no eggs, but the lemon flavor is 100% there. I hope you love this curd! It’s: Rich Creamy Thick Lemony Tart Perfectly sweet &amp; Seriously delicious I was so pleasantly surprised at the way this curd turned out! The coconut flavor is minimal (to none), the lemon really shines through, and it’s not too sweet. If you’re like me, you’ll want to enjoy this straight out of the jar, pudding style. But it also makes a delicious topping for waffles, pancakesand baked goods, like these Lemon Muffins!  If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

And when said dip has good-for-you ingredients like white beans and kale, I’m all in. Let’s do this.  This 10-ingredient dip is inspired by my Creamy Spinach &amp; Kale Dip, and loosely adapted from a recipe in our upcoming print cookbook! The sauceis made with cashews, vegan cream cheese, and nutritional yeast – which adds a healthy serving of vitamin B12. Garlic adds zest, while kale adds a punch of green color, fiber, and plenty of nutrients. Lastly, white beans addeven more creaminess to the dish, as well as fiber and plant-based protein.  Artichokes are often overlooked in the food world, in my opinion. While preparing them whole can be a little intimidatingand time consuming, canned artichoke hearts are easy to use, and they make such a delicious addition to creamy dips, salads, and pastas. Plus, they’re loaded with antioxidants and are especially high in fiber, among other benefits.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this dip! It’s: Insanely creamy Rich Cheesy Loaded with healthy ingredients Fiber- + protein-rich Easy Fast &amp; Delicious This dip would make the perfect side or appetizer to bring along to parties or when hosting. It can be made ahead of time and warmed up in the oven to save time. If you’re trying to imagine the flavor, it’s kind of like spinach and artichoke dip but better (!!) thanks tothe addition of kale, white beans, and nutritional yeast.

As I mentionedin our Best of February post, I am absolutely smitten with golden milk at the moment, also known as turmeric milk. I originally became intrigued after seeing it on one of my favorite vlogger’s channels, and then I scouted this recipe from Nutrition Stripped and have been making it nearly every day since. It makes an excellent substitute to morning coffee if you’re trying to cut back on caffeine (like me) in the afternoon when you need something to tide you over till dinner or in the evening to warm uporsatisfy a sweet tooth. I’m so into it, in fact, I recentlybrought some in a tea thermos along to the movies and I couldn’t have been happier (or warmer) sipping my golden milk during the film. Plus (!), no concession stand temptations –problem solved.  The base of this gorgeous,8-ingredientice cream is full-fat coconut milk for extra creamy texture. Ground turmeric, cinnamon, fresh ginger, black pepper, and cardamomaddwarm and comforting spice. And it’s sweetened naturally with maple syrup to offset the spices and make it truly dessert-worthy. All that’s left to do ischill, churn, throw in some candied ginger (optional), and you’re in golden milk ice cream heaven.  So what’s the big deal about golden milk? It’s SO healthy for you. The star of the show is turmeric, which hasmedicinal properties and is most wellknown for its anti-inflammatory effects.

0,Easy Vegan Kimchi | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Vegan Kimchi  This post was supposed to be brownies. Allow me to explain…   Maybe I should start by saying that this weekis John’s birthday (!!!) and last year around this time, I posted raw brownies – his most despised food on Earth. Not as in, ‘No, thanks. I’ll pass on the brownie,’ but ‘If you don’t get that brownie away from me, I might get sick.’ This year, I thought I’d post something that he actually liked: Kimchi.  Kimchi is a little complicated if you make it in anywhere close to the traditional way. Atminimum, it’sa bittime intensive (depending on how long you ferment). ButI did my best to keep this recipe simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredientsthat you should haveeasy access to. I included more photos than normal to demonstrate the step-by-step process, which hopefully helps when you tackle this recipe yourself! If you like kimchi, you have to try this vegan version that really is quite easyto master even though it takes longer than most (read: all) of my recipes.  How spicy do you like your kimchi? That will determine how much red chili flake you put in your sauce. You can likely find more “authentic” Korean red chili flakes at a Korean or Asian market, but I just went with standard red pepper flakes you can get at most grocery stores and it turned out great! We’re spice-lovers, so I added an entire 1/2 cup (YES 1/2 cup) to my sauce, but feel free to scale it back if you walk on the milder side.  The primary hands-on part of this recipe is the cabbage, which you salt to soften and draw outmoisture and flip every 30 minutes for a couple hours while you prep the other ingredients. It’s quite a therapeutic process, which can happenin the background while you do other things. One warning though? It makes whatever space it’s fermenting in smell like kimchi. You have been warned.  I hope you guys LOVE this kimchi! It’s: Spicy Tangy Crunchy Super healthy Fragrant &amp; Delicious If you’re like us, you can find an excuse to put kimchi on anything. Think: Breakfast scrambles, brown rice and sautéed veggie bowls at lunch, or stir-fries at dinner. Because it’s fermented, kimchi provides plenty of microorganisms that promotea healthy gut, can help reduce inflammation, and even improve digestion (just to name a few).

0,Banana & Berry Hemp Seed Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banana &amp; Berry Hemp Seed Pudding  This is another dishinspired by our time in Oslo, Norway. For only spending 24 hours there, I’m still a little perplexed as tohow I managed to gaintwo completely differentideas for the blog. I’m not complaining, and neither are my taste buds. Let’s make some simple, healthy dessert, shall we?  When we’re traveling, it’s oftendifficult to find anything sweet outside of dairy-free chocolate at the grocery store. So when we stumbled upon alocal cafe that had some vegan options, I was thrilled. Because of the language gap, I wasn’t quite sure what I was ordering. But I knew it was “dairy-free” and a “pudding” and it had “berries.” Good enough for me. This recipe is quite basic and simple, requiring just 6 ingredients and 1 bowl (food processor). The idea is simple: Kind of like a thicker banana berry-based smoothie with hemp seeds and chia seeds.The result is a naturally-sweet “pudding” that’s perfect for snacking or alighter dessert. It almost goes without saying, but this dessert is packed with free-radical fighting antioxidants thanks to the berries, potassium from the bananas, Omega 3 fatty acids and protein from the chia seeds, and all 20 amino acids (including the 9 amino acids our bodies can’t produce) from the hemp seeds.

0,Vegan Snickers Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Snickers Cheesecake  By now, you must know ofmy fondness for Snickers bars. It doesn’t get much better than a candy bar coated in peanuts and caramel and dunked in chocolate. I mean, wow. Unless, that is, you turnit into anIce Cream Snickers Bar. Like, whoa. As you might’ve guessed, it was only a matter of time before I smooshed together my love for Snickers and cheesecake. The results? Totally drool-worthy, and it all happens with just 10 simple ingredients.  This cheesecake begins with my go-to date-walnut crust. Dates, walnuts, and sea salt whirled together to create a tender, naturally sweetened base for our cheesecake.  While the crust sets in the freezer, it’s time to move on to the1-ingredient date caramel. ONE INGREDIENT, people. It’s magic. Simply add dates into a food processor and thin with a little hot water. Voila – we have a caramel ribbon ready to swirl through our cheesecake.   Next comes roasted salted peanuts for that salty-sweet flavor contrast and added crunch. Swoon.  The hard part is waiting for it all to set in the freezer for about 4-6 hours. Butit’s so worth the wait. Patience, my friend.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this cheesecake! It’s: Rich Salty-sweet Creamyin the center Crunchy on top Chocolaty Caramel-y Peanut-y &amp; Delicious This would make the perfect dessert for a weekend treat or to celebrate special occasions (you know, like Tuesday).

0,1-Pot Red Lentil Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Pot Red Lentil Chili  Sometimes inspiration comes from the most unexpectedplaces. I posted this picture on Instagram a few weeks ago (for my Red Lentil Curry), and someone asked if it was red lentil chili. “No, but GOOD IDEA,” I replied. The rest is history. I couldn’t shake the thought from my mind.  This chili comes just in time for theselast few wintry days before spring arrives (at least here in the Pacific Northwest). It’s simple, requiring just 1 pot, basicingredients, and comes together in less than 1 hour.  I’ve been inspired by some Indian cooking methods I’ve been researchinglately involving a mortar and pestle. Instead of just mincing or chopping your vegetables, spices, and herbs, you grind them together so their flavor is more intense and more evenly distributed throughout the dish. Of course, if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use a small food processor or just finely mince. I just lovethis method, and now that I’ve discovered it, I can’t stop!  In addition to red lentils–which are full of fiber, protein, folate, and magnesium (just to name a few) – I also included black beans (another great source of folate and fiber) and kidney beans (which are especially high in iron and vitamin B1). This isn’t one of those soup-like chilis that’s mostly tomatoes. This is chock full of lentils, beans, and corn, and is thick and stew-like in texture – my favorite.  I hope you love this chili! It’s: Hearty Smoky Flavorful Not too spicy Healthy Comforting Satisfying &amp; Simple Make this dish for a crowd, as it’s especially great for hosting. Or make a batch over the weekendand enjoyit for lunch throughout the week. If you try this recipe, let us know! It helps us and other readers so much.

0,Easy Chana Masala | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Chana Masala  Traveling. Why do we travel? It’s so challenging and tiring and I constantly have to manage my expectations before we ever get there. And especially when we arrive (like when we show up in Croatia and it’s cold and windyand loud) and I getsick. That sounded negative. But no,it’s honesty. If you haven’t noticed, even though traveling is hard sometimes, we stilllove it,travel often, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to do so. In fact, we’re hopeful to spend more time traveling this year and I cannot wait. Despite its challenges, traveling does one big thing for me: It inspires. Pretty much every meal we sit down to is an opportunity to learn about a new culture. How wonderful.  This recipe was inspired by a meal we stumbled upon in Oslo, Norway.Despite it being quite cold and windy and the shops being closed because it was a Sunday (manage expectations, Dana, manage expectations…), we found this amazing Indian restaurant where I enjoyedone of the best meals I’ve ever had. Yes, big claims! And it’s all because of their chana masala (and mango chutney…oh my word).  Chana masala is traditionally based with green chilies, onion, garlic, fresh cilantro, a blend of spices, chickpeas, and tomatoes. It can be prepareda number of different ways, but I chose the simple route: 1 pot and about30 minutes required.  It startswith onion and cumin. Next comes a paste of green chilis, ginger, garlic, and fresh cilantro. The bulk of the flavor comes from coriander, chili powder, and ground turmeric. Chickpeas add plenty of fiber, texture, and protein, and puréed tomatoes add body and richness. The magical step that takes this dish from love it toGIVE ME ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW is the garam masala (I include a simple DIY blend below), and fresh lemon juice.  The result is a thick, stew-like curry that’s extremely flavorful, easy to make, not overly spicy, and the perfect hearty plant-based meal. Enjoy this dishon its own, over rice, cauliflower rice, or – my personal favorite – over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (easy recipe below). I know, it sounds weird, but it’s SO good, and another way to get more plants into your diet. If you try this dish, let us know what you think!

0,Peanut Butter and Jelly Chia Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter and Jelly Chia Pudding  Friends, this is a real thing, and it’s happening right now. If you aren’t a PB&amp;J fan, look away. But if you are (and who isn’t?), this is the chia pudding for you. Ready your breakfast spoons.  I’ve been snapchatting more recently (username: minimalistbaker). Have you been following along? If so, you know I’m in the best kind of breakfast rut right now: steel-cut oats with peanut butter, toasted almonds, and a simple blueberry compote. Several of you asked me for the recipe. And because I’m a tease (and I think oats are so easy!), I thought I’d take that concept and turn it into something more exciting. Because, like, have you seen chia pudding? Talk about eye candy!  This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 basicingredients and 30 minutes prep time (plus chilling). The magic happens in the fridge where it gels up and turns into a pudding-like consistency. Why chia seeds? So cooland so healthy. Cool because they absorb 10 times their weight and water and turn just about anythingthey’re added to into a magical pudding or gel. They can also be subbed for flaxseed in a flax egg. It’s like kitchen science. And healthy because they’re rich inOmega 3 and 6 fatty acids, fiber, protein, and calcium (just to name a few).  This PB&amp;J chia seed pudding is simple in concept and so easy to make. The base is a blueberry compote made with wild blueberries, orange juice, and chia seeds. And the chia pudding is made with almond and coconut milk, peanut butter, a little maple syrup, vanilla, and chia seeds. Add another spoonful ofpeanut butter and a few fresh blueberries on topand you have a breakfast or snack that’s seriously healthy for you, yet tastes like dessert.  I hope you all love this chia pudding! It’s: Creamy Peanut buttery Berry-packed Perfectly sweet Healthy Satisfying &amp; Insanely delicious This recipe yields aboutthree servings, making it perfect for preparing ahead of time and and enjoying throughout the week. It would also make a healthy snack or dessert for kids, because even picky eaters love PB&amp;J. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Curried Beet Soup with Tandoori Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curried Beet Soup with Tandoori Chickpeas  I have a thing for Indian food (see Spicy Red Lentil Curry,Curried Butternut Squash Soup, Green Chickpea Curry with Couscous, 30-minute Coconut Curry, andSamosa Potato Cakes.) The obsessionlives on, and I have another treat for you guys:A 30-minute curried beet soup with crispy tandoori-roasted chickpeas. You in?  There’s an Indian restaurant in Portland called Bollywood Theaterthat’s quite sensational. They serve a roasted beet dishcooked incoconut milk and curry leaves. Mmm. So many people had raved about them I had to try them myself. The bad news: While the flavor and concept was there, the texture wasn’t what I was hoping for. The good news:I made my very own inspired version at home and turned it into soup. Spoiler alert: Mine (in my opinion) is better than the original concept (just sayin’).  This soupis simple, requiring just 30 minutes from start to finish. It’s also vegan, gluten free, and loaded with health benefits. Beetsare rich in iron, fiber, folate, vitamin C, and potassium. They’re also a natural anti-inflammatory, are loaded with disease-fighting phytonutrients, and help the body detoxify. Coconut milk not only provides a creamy base to this soup, italso boastshealthy doses of B vitamins and vitamin C, as well as iron, selenium, and calcium. Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory andpain reducer. It’salso proven to helpsettle an upset stomach and also improvesdigestive function. Also, delicious. Garlic also acts as an anti-inflammatory in the body, and is a great source of vitamin C, B6, manganese, and selenium. Somehow, italso contains compounds thathelp regulate our blood pressure. I know, it’s magic.   While your soup is cooking, roast your chickpeas. I toss mine in a simple mixture of salt, coconut sugar, and my go-to tandoori masala spice blend, which you can find at spice markets and grocery stores like Whole Foods. The result is a tender chickpea with a slightly crispy edge and a rich, smoky, subtlyspicy flavor – perfect for topping this soup.  I hope you all love this soup! It’s: Creamy Comforting Curry-spiced Hearty Earthy Healthy &amp; Quick If you have an abundance of beets in your pantry, this is the recipefor you. This soup is perfect for when you’re craving something a little spicy, warm, and comforting.

No,I’m not ignoring how food tastes and shoveling protein shakes in my face. I’mgoing about thingsin a more intentionalway, considering how Ican thoughtfully incorporatemore healthy protein sources into my daily diet.Ya dig? Turns out, toget moreprotein, simply pay attention to how much protein foods offer, and make each meal count. If you’re looking for a list ofprotein-rich foods, check out my post on 15 Vegan Protein Sources. I also found this articlereally helpful. Whether you’re lookingto get moreprotein into your dietor not, this recipe is a must-try.

Lastly, they create an ultra creamy base for this pesto infused with basil, Italian parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and vegan parmesan cheese.   To keep this recipe gluten free, I relied on my go-to gluten free Fussili Pasta from Trader Joe’s, which is just quinoa and brown rice! I have a discerning palette and can attest that this passes thereal pasta test, and doesn’t give off “healthy pasta” vibes. Plus, it’s protein rich, with 1 cup cooked providing 5 grams of protein. And let’s be real, we’re totally eating at least 2 cups, so you can go ahead and clock in10 grams of protein (see how I did that? It’s the power of magic and math).  I hope you guys LOVE this pasta! It’s: Vegan Gluten Free Quick Filling Insanely Flavorful Protein-rich &amp; Healthy This would make such a great meal when you’re looking for something both comforting and healthy. And since it only takes 30 minutes, it’s doable for both lunch and dinner! Also, can we just talk about the leftovers? So delicious.

In my opinion, if you put anything atop pasta and red sauce, it’s exciting (what does that tell you about my social life?). In addition to being simple, these meatballs are also vegan and gluten-free, and packed with flavor thanks to fresh parsley, dried herbs, tomato paste, and vegan parmesan cheese. They get their golden brown crust from vegan parmesan cheese and a quick sauté in a skillet, before finishing off in the oven to help them crisp up even more.

It’s one of our most frequently made (and praised)recipes on the blog. Because I love it so much, I wanted to make an Indian-inspired version. My first attempt was too vegetable heavy and a little dry. I’m all about sauciness and big flavor in dishes, so it was back to the drawing board. The more I thought about what I actually wanted in an Indian-inspired “Buddha Bowl,” I realized I wanted a few key things: heat, intenseflavor, sauciness, lentils, and brown rice. Mission accomplished.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes, 1 saucepan(plus a pot for thebrown rice), and 10 ingredients to make! The base of the recipe is garlic, ginger, carrots sautéed in coconut oil, and red curry paste. Tomato paste and vegetable broth make a deeply flavorful sauce, while turmeric and coconut sugar adddepth of flavor. An optional but recommended last step is a dash of light coconut milk to add creaminess and balance the heat. Lentils not only add heartiness, but also nutrition. They are extremely high in folate, iron, and magnesium. One serving of this lentil curry boastsnearly 16 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein!

Something a little indulgent, but not so off the rails that you need to implement a new workoutroutine afterwards? I have just the thing: Easy. Vegan. Chocolate. But no seriously, easy.  I’ve been making chocolate for a while now! My first attempt was chocolate bars, which were delicious and made witha mix of cocoa butter and coconut oil. Then I went slightly heavier on my cocoa butter : coconut oil ratio in these Raw Double Chocolate Macaroons. So ridiculously good. Andyou know what I discoveredafter all this experimenting?Cocoa butter is king. Here’s why: Cocoa butter melts like a dream; There’s zero coconut flavor; When you add cacao powder, it becomes super velvety and doesn’t separate; Once it sets, it doesn’t melt in your hands (like coconut oil); It just tastes better, creamier, more delicious. Convinced? Good, because you need some cocoa butter in your life.  This recipe is simple requiring just 3 primaryingredients,1 bowl, and less than30 minutes to prepare! Plus, it’s customizable. I left mine pretty basic, adding only cacao nibs, a hint of vanilla, and a little sea salt.But you could add dried fruit, candied ginger, toasted nuts, toasted coconut…really anything you’re craving. Make this chocolate exactly how you like it! It’sthe perfect base for experimenting.  So, why make chocolate at home when you can buy it at the store? Let me tell you. Homemade is simply better.

But there is something to be said for a soft cheese. And what better time to try it than now, especially with Valentine’s Day right around the corner?!

But the prep is so simple and quick that it’s one of those recipes that happens in the background while you’re doing other things.  So,where does the flavor come from? Good question. Minced garlic and garlic powder add ‘zing’ and depth; Lemon zest adds tart and brightness; Lemon juice adds acidity; Nutritional yeast adds cheesiness; Salt adds flavor and, you know, saltiness. Once it’s done chilling in the fridge, unwrap and coat with fresh dill. Serious yum, and so flavorful.  I hope you all love this cheese!

Win win!  While I hadtried makingbaked macaroons before, I hadn’t tried making a raw version. Spoiler alert, this version iseven easier, and I found I prefer the raw over the baked!  The coating is made from simple ingredients: cocoa butter (see notes for substitution options), coconut oil, cacao powder, and agave nectar or maple syrup. That’s right, these beauties are naturally sweetened, which means they’re basically health food (am I right?).  I hope you all love these macaroons! They’re: Tender with a slight crunch Perfectly sweet Super chocolaty Coconutty Rich Surprisingly healthy Raw &amp; Delicious These are great tohave around for a healthier dessert or snack. And because they travel well, they also make a great treatto bring along to parties. If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,General Tso's Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"General Tso’s Tofu Stir-Fry  This is one of those comfort food dishesthat you make when a serious takeout craving hits, but youstill want to cook at hometo save a few calories and dollars. My General Tso’s tofu is the perfect balance of spicy, sweet, and savory. It is loaded with protein (20+ grams per serving!) and comes together in just 30 minutes!  This recipe is a reader request – thanks Marshette! Much like Singapore Noodles, I had never actually tried General Tso’s stir fry before. But from what I hear, it’s traditionally lightly battered and fried chicken tossed with a savory-sweet sauce, and cooked with green onion and dried red chilies for heat. I think I can get on board with that.  To keep my version plant-based, I went with tofu. If you’ve followed this blog for long, you’ve probably seen my favorite way to make tofu taste good. Well, even though I still love that method, I may love this new method even more (one I adaptedfrom The Kitchn)! Simply marinate the tofu in a bit of soy sauce, maple syrup, and chili garlic sauce before dredging in cornstarch and pan-frying in a little oil. The result is a flavorful tofu that’s crispy on the outside, tender (not mushy) on the inside, and comes together in about20 minutes!  This dish gets some serious heat from dried red chilies, which you can find in most traditional and Asian grocery stores. However, if you have trouble locating some, either use fresh red chilies or extra chili garlic sauce. Whatever you do, don’t skip the heat! That’s what makes this dish balanced and delicious.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this fake-out takeout dish. It’s: Extremelyflavorful Perfectly spiced Not too sweet Satisfying Comforting Quick &amp; Dang delicious This would make the perfect entrée to make when you’re craving takeout but want to stay in and make it a little healthier! Don’t get me wrong – I wouldn’t call this “health food.” But it is much lighter than what you’ll find at restaurants. Plus, 20 grams protein per serving!  If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Spicy Buffalo Chickpea Wraps | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Buffalo Chickpea Wraps  Have I ever told you I was raised on spicy food? If I was to survey my dad’s pantryright now, I’d likely only find canned soup, black pepper, and a giant jarof jalapeños. You know, the essentials. Icoat my food withblack pepper before ever trying it. When we eat Thai, you can hardly see my food under the blanket ofsriracha. When we order takeout, Irequest “extra spicy, no seriously.” It’s a habit I’ve passed on to John, too, who now outdoes me in the hot sauce department, and has become even more of a sauce addict than I am. We’re quite the pair.  This recipe was inspired by a meal afriendmade me a long time ago. It was so simple but so delicious:Buffalo chicken wraps with bleu cheese dressing, romaine lettuce,and vegetables. It was so, so good that it has stuck in my mind and I’ve been wanting to make a plant-based version ever since.  This recipe is easy to make, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutes.The concept is sosimple: 3-ingredient hummus-based dressing, tossed with romaine lettuce; Chickpeas seasonedwithhot sauce + garlic powder, and lightlysautéed; Addto a pita or tortilla, roll up, and serve! Yes, it’s that easy.  I hope you all love these wraps! They’re: Savory Spicy Hearty Crunchy from the vegetables Tender from the chickpeas Quick Protein- + fiber-filled &amp; Delicious These would make the perfect lazy weeknight dinner when you’re craving something satisfying but quick.

I don’t know how many times I’ve gazed longingly upon other diner’s salads, whilemy sad, oily balsamic vinaigrette drips down lettuce that deserved something better. Something creamier. Something zesty. Something garlicky. I think youget where this is going. I’m tired of not being able to enjoyCaesar saladbecause the dressing isn’t dairy-free. So I decided to make my own! The best part is, it only takes 5 minutes. No cashew soaking, grinding, or blending involved. You cando this – and you totally should.  The base for this simple,6-ingredient, 5-minute dressing is hummus. It creates a creamy, savory base that’s easy to come by since there’s almost always hummus in the fridge. Or at least in my fridge. Next comes copious amounts of minced garlic, capers for that salty ocean taste, lemon juice + zest for brightness, and a little spicy mustard for zing. Add salt and pepper to taste and you’re good to go.  I hope you all love this dressing! It’s: Creamy Bold Savory Briney Garlicky Slightly spicy Undetectably dairy-free 100% delicious This dressing would be perfect on hearty salads, especially kale that’s been massaged with a little lemon and olive oil.

A fewweeks ago I shared these pancakes on Instagram and asked if it would be too forwardto call them“Better than Sex Pancakes.” Most of you agreed it was a great name, a few of you were a tad embarrassed, and a handful of others offered up even raunchier title ideas.

Oh, and obviously stretchy pants and an oversized sweater are involved. That’s a given. A reader requested I make vegan biscotti (hi, Aditi!), and I thought it was such a great idea. In my research, I learned biscotti means “twice baked” in Italian. And, as you might’ve guessed, this crunchy cookie traditionally enjoyed with a hot beverage originates from Italy – swoon. My girl, Giada, knows what’s up.  This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 1 bowl and 10 ingredients! It’s also madewithcoconut oiland sweetened with organic cane sugar (sub coconut sugar if you’d like!). If you’ve never made biscotti, the concept is very straightforward. Make a cookie dough, shape it into two logs, bake until slightly golden brown, and cool. Then slice into small segments and bake once more. That’s it!

Fresh and ground ginger add spice, cinnamon adds warmth, and a shot of bourbon – which is totally optional – makes itboozy and delicious.  I hope you guys love this toddy. It’s: Warm Comforting Gingery Naturally sweet Subtly spiced Infused with rooibos Bourbon spiked &amp; Insanely delicious This is the perfect cocktail to make for a group, especially for New Year’s Eve when it’s cold and blustery and you want something warm to celebrate with.

What are the odds? Me, too!  Actually, have I ever told you the few days after Christmas are my least favorite of the year? There is no joy in those days. The tree comes down. The presents are all opened. The sky turns grey(at least in my world). Your family leaves with their cookies. I mean,isn’t it the worst?  OK, maybe I’ve matured a little since 13. Not much, but a little. Now I know there is so much to look forward to after Christmas.

Sweet potatoes. Specifically, sweet potatoes stuffed with quinoa and all the Mexican-inspired toppings. Get on board.  This recipe is simple, requiring just basic 10 ingredients (give or take a topping). And it’s healthy, entirely plant-based,and gluten-free.

0,Simple Hazelnut Butter | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cinnamon Hazelnut Butter  How is already almost Christmas!? I don’t even know. If you’re anything like me, you’re probablythe worst gift-giver ever. You and Ishow up at places where everyone else is bestowing gifts, and we’rethe ones awkwardly standing in the corner, empty handed because we either forgot, ran out of time, or lacked the creativity to think of something gift-worthy. On the upside, wedid manage to find a really good sale on boots for ourselvesearlier, so go us! I know, we’rethe worst. But I have a solution.  Nuts. OK, not just nuts, but nut butter! Everyone loves nut butter and it’s such a guaranteed way to make someone’s day.Plus, chances are they’ll actually use and enjoy it unlike some other gifts – which is the best kind of gift to receive.  Here’s the deal with hazelnuts. They’re extremely healthy for you. Beyond just beinghigh in protein and healthy fats, hazelnuts are the tree nut withthe highest amount of folate (helps create normal red blood cells), they’re high in fiber (important for digestion), and rich in manganese (needed for bone formation) and copper (needed for iron absorption). They’re also highin biotin, which is a B Vitamin that helps grow strong, healthy hair. I rest my case. You need hazelnuts in your life.  Not only do you get the health benefits of hazelnuts, you also get a dose of cinnamon, which everyone knows is high in antioxidants, has anti-inflammatory properties, and can lower blood sugar levels. Not to mention it tastes like the holidays. Lucky for you this edible gift requires just 3 ingredients and 30 minutes to make. And, it’s totally customizable. Sub pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon for a more autumnal feel, or swap it for melted dark chocolate togo for my 4-Ingredient Vegan Nutella instead! Who would turn away Nutella? No one with good taste, am I right?  I hope you all love this nut butter. It’s: Creamy Slightly crunchy Salty Perfectly sweet Cinnamon-infused Satisfying &amp; Delicious on everything Not only does this make a great gift (package it in little mason jars and wrap it with ribbon), it’s also a great spread to have around for things liketoast, pancakes, waffles, and more. My personal favorite way to enjoyhazelnut butter is dipping a spoonful into roasted sunflower seeds and eating it right off the spoon! It’s also extremely delicious on bananas, rice cakes, and pretty much everything else. If you try this recipe, let us know!

It was a little light bulb moment. I never thought “healthy” brittle could be a thing, but guess what? It totally is.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and about 30 minutes to prepare(plus a little extra for cooling). It’s naturally sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrup, calls for coconut oil in place ofvegan butter, and is jam-packed with nutrient-dense ingredientslike oats, chia seeds,and quinoa!

0,Coconut Oil Blueberry Scones | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Oil Blueberry Scones with Rosemary  Can you believe I haven’t made a single vegan scone for this blog? Me neither! That had to change. Luckily, the perfect inspiration came from a cozy little coffee shop on the Oregon Coast called Sea Levelthat serves up a savory rosemary blueberry scone that’s a total game changer. It was love at firstbite, and I immediately knew I wanted to try and recreate it at home. So, I got to work.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 10 ingredients to prepare. After some testing, I settled on a mix of spelt flour and unbleached all purpose flour for the base. I did attempt a gluten free version, but it didn’t work out (if you find success, let me know in the comments!). I also thinkyou could use all spelt for a heartier scone, or all unbleached all purpose for a lighter, bakery-style scone. The choice is totally up to you. I used organic cane sugar to sweeten –but just a little. I didn’t want the end result to be too sweet or too savory – rather, somewhere right in the middle. And in place of vegan butter, I used coconut oil, which worked beautifully! This is a swap I’ve been making in my baking recipes lately (like theCoconut Oil Pie Crust!) and loving the results.  Wild blueberries add a burst of color and natural sweetness to the scones, whilerosemary complements the fruitbeautifully while adding an earthy flavor that’snot overwhelming. Who knew rosemary and blueberry could be such good friends?  These scones bake up beautifully. I think you’re going to love them. They’re: Perfectly flaky Tender on the inside Crisp on the outside Not toosweet Slightly savory Studded with berries+herbs &amp; Positively delicious These would make the perfect snackto share with a friend over coffee or tea. It doesn’t get much better. They would also be great as a light breakfast, snack, or healthier dessert. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Sweet Potato Lasagna | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Lasagna  Pardon me while I present yet another noodle-free ‘pasta’ dish that’s like the originalbut somehow better and entirely plant-based. Not to brag or anything, but this is totally happening (again), and it totally rules.  This lasagna is inspired by three things: 1) My love for lasagna (forever and ever, amen) 2) My successfulrecreations of it usingboth eggplant + spaghetti squash 3) My never-ending love affair with sweet potatoes  The filling is my go-to tofu ricotta. It’s creamy, lemony, herby, delicious, and a convincingdupe for the real thing. Trust me on this one – you need this in your life. And the ‘pasta noodles’ arethinly-sliced sweet potatoes, which addthe perfect tender texture and sweet flavor contrast to the savory ‘ricotta.’ In other words,swoon.   How is this recipe simple? I’m so glad you asked. It requires just 9 basicingredients, simple methods, and about 1 hour from start to finish. While this recipe lacks amarinara sauce as in a traditional lasagna, I argue it doesn’t need it! However, if you’re a sauce-lover like me, I do include an optional (but highly recommended) basil pesto sauce that’s positively amazing (and still keeps the recipe within my 10-ingredient standard). It not only adds a burst of vibrant green color, but alsoa punch of herby-garlic flavor that finishes the dish perfectly (in my humble opinion).  I think you guys are going to LOVE this lasagna! It’s: Savory-sweet Comforting Satisfying Healthy Protein-packed Simple Flavorful &amp; Delicious I created this recipe with comfort food-loving folks in mind.

I do. They’re our next door neighbors and I’m so thankful for them. We actually met last year whentheypopped over around Christmas time to deliver some cookies. Nice, right? Why didn’t I think of that (especially considering I’m a baker– yikes)? Since then we’ve invaded each others’ apartments at least once a weekto exchange foodand hugsand storiesabout thechaos of ourdays. I guess you could say we’re officially besties.  A while back theyfed medinner when John was away. The recipe was from Smitten Kitchen’s cookbook and it was so, so delicious that it inspired me to make something similar for the blog. The original recipe was for black bean and spaghetti squash tacos (genius, right?). The flavor and texture combination was brilliant! I had seconds, nay,thirds. I lost count. All I know is squash and black beans belong together.  Despite being made from scratch (with the exception of theblack beans and tortillas), this recipe is quite simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and a little more than an hour to prepare. The enchilada sauce is a takeon the red sauce from myChipotle Vegan Chilaquiles (a must-try if you haven’t already!). It’s smoky and rich and pairs perfectly with the buttery sweetness of the squash.  The filling is so simple: roasted butternut squash and black beans seasoned with a few dry spices and a spoonful of the enchilada sauce. Swoon. What happens next is magic. These enchiladas bake upbeautifully, acquiring a slight crisp on the edges while remaining completely tender on the inside.  The toppings make all the difference. I opted for ripe avocado and cilantro, but red onion would also add a burst of color and a slight crunch. Also, pumpkin seeds! The options are endless.  I hope you all love these enchiladas! They’re: Simple Hearty Flavorful Smoky Spicy &amp; Downright delicious Make this recipewhen you’re craving something hearty and comforting this winter.

It’s so simple in nature you likely already have most of the ingredients on hand right now (the best kind of recipe, in my opinion). Peppery arugula is combinedwith crisp apples, toasted pecans, red onion, and dried cranberries, and it’s all dressed with a bright, vibrant lemon vinaigrette. Plus, just15minutes(!!) and 8basic ingredientsto prepare – my idea of salad perfection. This would make the perfect light and healthy dishto help you fill up on plantsand erase some of that pie guilt likely lingering from yesterday’s feast. We’ve all been there. Salad to the rescue.

But what about when life is hard, or things don’t go the way youplanned, or something happensand your sense of reality shifts? What then? 2015 was perhaps my most personally challenging year yet, one wherein things didn’t go ‘as planned’ for me.I was left feeling a little sad and angry and frustrated and just generally not like myself (what a bizarre sensation). It allmade me realize I’m not as strong or spontaneous or resilient as I thought I was.In short, this year kind of kicked my ass. The gritty details aren’t the important part. The important partis I think it’s OKto besad, orangry, or disappointed, or tired, or whatever it is you’re feeling right now that’s not radiantjoy. It doesn’t mean you’re not thankful. It just means you’re giving yourself permission to feel your feelings (which is perfectly healthy, by the way).And it’s OK if what comes out isn’t all roses and sunshine. My encouragement is, cry it out if you need to.No one’s looking anyway.And while you’re at it, eat some pie and hug your mom. I’ve found these to beequally sufficient remedies.

And becauseI know you’re busy, this recipe takes just 30 minutes fromstart to finish. Let’s do this!  Funny story: I thought I hated delicata squash (beforeI evertried it).

I cannotwait to share this recipe with you. It’s perfect for fall andwinter and will make you so many friends if you bring it along to holiday gatherings. Let’s get to it!   This recipe is simple, requiring just 1 bowl to prepare and simple ingredientsyou likely have right now. Since September, I’ve had a bowl of apples lying around constantly, which is a little dangerous now that I have this recipe on hand. Think apple crisp once a week. Yeah, that’s probably going to happen all winter long.  This isn’tthe healthiest apple crisp, but it does have some pretty amazing things going for it. For one, it’s naturally sweetened with muscovado and coconut sugar. It’s also vegan butter-free, and uses coconut oil (or olive oil) instead. It’s also gluten-free optional when you use a gluten-free flour blend in place of the unbleached all purpose.  The filling is perfect. Apples are generously coated with coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and fresh ginger. Apple juice adds extra sweetnessand helps cook the apples to tender perfection, while arrowroot and cornstarch help create a thick, caramel-like sauce. The topping is amazing as well with plenty of texture from rolled oats, almond meal, and chopped pecans. Muscovado and coconut sugar add sweetness, while cinnamon adds warmth and autumnalflavor.  Friends, this truly is the best vegan apple crisp! It’s: Tender Warm Comforting Perfectly sweet Subtly spiced Perfect for fall + the holidays &amp; Insanely delicious I made this for the first timefor a group offriends and everyone was silent as we savoredthose first few bites.

Plus, there’s no specialty equipment involved – just a muffin tin, blender (or food processor or whisk), rolling pin, and pastry cutter (or fork). I wanted to keep this recipe approachable so everyone could join the fun.  Can I tell you how excited I am that I figured out coconut oil pie crust? I tried several methods without success, all requiring to chill or freeze the coconut oil before adding to the crust. But it always made the dough rock hard, which resulted in a crust that was difficult to form and cracked. Oy! But, in a moment of despair, I finally discovered you can just use coconut oil right out of the jar for a perfectly-flaky, easy-to-work-with crust that doesn’t taste like coconut in the final product! Three cheers for this happy kitchen accident.  Once your mini crusts are formed, simply blend your filling ingredients, pour into your tins, and bake! The real challenge? Waiting for them to cool. But trust me! It’s worth your patience. Make your coconut whipped cream to pass the time. These pies are PERFECT. They’re: Mini Flaky Pumpkin-y Tender Sweet Subtly spiced Portable Simple &amp; Delicious Make these for Thanksgiving. Make these for fall parties. Make thesefor no reason at all, other than the fact that it’s November, the leaves are turning, andpumpkin pie is the best. If you try this recipe, let us know how it goes!

0,Sweet Potato Kale Breakfast Hash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Sweet Potato &amp; Kale Breakfast Hash  What are your fall rituals? Mine include coffee dates,pumpkin pie making, walks with this hunk, gawking atall the gorgeous fallcolors, and being cozy inside whilst reading magazines. I also try and make it a pointto visit our local farmers markets before they close up shop forwinter (boo).  This fall, I’ve beengoing to the farmers market most Saturdays with friends, snatching up whatever looks good, and thenheading home and roasting it in the oven and calling it ‘brunch.’ My favorite roasted vegetables are sweet potatoes and red onion. Theyget all tender and caramelized and sweet and I could eat them all day every day with nothing but hummus and hot sauce. (Weird, I know.Stop judging me.) This recipe is inspired by that vegetable combination, with the addition of kale (hooray!) and masala-spiced scrambled tofu.  Tofu scrambles used to elude me, with their complicated seasonings and methods, but now I think they’re so easyI couldmake them in my sleep! Simply crumbleand season your tofu with a mix of smoky, spicy, and salty seasonings. My go-to spice blendhas been the tandoori masala mix from Whole Foods. It’s absolutely perfect for roasting vegetables of any kind, and especially for amplifying the flavor of tofu scrambles. If you can’t find it, worry not! I included a DIY blend in the notes.  This recipe is simple, requiring 10ingredients (give or take a spice). Andit all happens quickly (about 45 minutes) since you prep your tofu and kale while the vegetables are roasting away. This tofu scramble is my new favorite! It’s: Savory Loaded with vegetables Hearty Flavorful Easy Quick &amp; Super satisfying This would make the perfect lazy weekend breakfast or brunch. If you aren’t into tofu, sub crispy chickpeas! Or, if you’re super lazy (like I am), just serve this with a generous spoonful of hummus and call it a meal. It doesn’t get simpler than that.

0,Vegan Pumpkin Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Pumpkin Muffins (Vegan + GF)  You guys, it’s November! (What!?) Can we still pumpkin? Please say yes. I have a lot more pumpkin enthusiasm to exert before this year is over.  This recipe is inspired by my favorite 1-Bowl Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread! It’s so tender, crumbly, and bursting with pumpkinflavor I couldn’t resist turning it into muffins. And the crumb topping is a take onmy Vegan Banana Crumb Muffins, which isone ofmy favorite muffin recipes on the blog. I took the best of both recipes to make these muffins, which are: Vegan +gluten-free Naturally sweetened (Vegan) butter-free &amp; 1 bowl-required  I worked hard to perfect the tender yet crumbly texture of the interior of these muffins, and to infuse the perfect amount of sweetness and fall spice. Mission accomplished. The crumb topping makes these muffins, in my opinion. A mix of coconut oil, muscovado or coconut sugar, pecans, and gluten-free flour createsthe perfect crispy, sweet finish. Serious yum.  I hope you all love these muffins! They’re: Crumbly Tender Pumpkin-y Sweet Slightly crisp from the topping Kind of perfect &amp; Simple These would make the perfect take-along snack for work or school. They would also make a lovely holiday gift or dessert for fall parties. And since they’re refined sugar-free, gluten free, and vegan, everyone can enjoy. If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Vegan Stuffed Poblano Peppers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Stuffed Poblano Peppers  One of the things I initially found most challenging about eating moreplant-based meals wasactually feelingfull. I’ve always been a quantity eater. I’m not the girl who takes takes three bites of my salad, holds my stomach, and sighs, “Oof, can’t have one more bite. It’s too much.” Nope. Give me those last two bites and your last two bites or else. I’m hangry.  The real issue was mental. I kept thinking, “How can I possibly get full and stay full on salads, rice, and beans?” I’ll tell you how. If youeat enough riceand beans (and other vegan protein sources), throw in a tonof vegetables, and drink plenty of water, you’ll be too full to remember what food scarcity you were ever complaining about in the first place. In my quest to create more hearty, plant-based meals, I started to learnwhat it took to feed my body well – in both quantityandnourishment. Dishes like myMediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes,Grillable Veggie Burgers, Roasted Sweet Potato Chickpea Salad, and Chickpea Shawarma Sandwiches began filling my plate, and over time, I realizedmeatless meals can fillme up. My top tip for creating satiating plant-based meals is to combine several foods that are highin fiber and protein to keep you satisfied, and to create more texture inyour dish. Instead of having just tofu, throw in some healthy brown rice and vegetables! Instead of having just black beans, throw in some plantains and peppers and corn tortillas! Instead of having just quinoa, addin some beans and bell peppers! This recipewas born out of that idea. Knowing myself, a meal of pinto beans and rice isn’texciting or filling enough for me. But when you throw in a poblano pepper (with tons of fiber and vitamins), and add a little avocado on top, I’m one satisfied eater. Let me show you how.  This recipe may look a little complex, but it’s actually quite simple. It requires just 9ingredients andeasy-to-master methods. It starts with brown rice, amplified in flavor bysautéed onion, cilantro, cumin, and salsa. Next comes pinto beans for addedprotein and fiber. Stuff all that goodness inside poblano peppers and bake until tender. That’s it!  Toppings are optional, but I’m kind of a sauce lover myself, so I went with more salsa, cilantro, and some of my favorite Cilantro Avocado Dressing. Mmm, dreamy.  I know you guys are going to LOVE this dish! It’s: Hearty Satisfying Flavorful Warm Comforting Subtly spiced Healthy &amp; Easy to make This would be the perfect dish for meat-eaters and vegans alike!It proves how simple and possible it is to get full and nourished onmeatless meals.

If you’ve followed our blog for a while now, you probably already know aboutmy favorite queso recipe, which is made without cashews and with eggplant instead! That recipe still has my heart because it usesan entire vegetable in place of butter and cheese and whatever else goes into conventional queso dip. Healthy swaps for the win. But,sometimes you don’t want vegetables in your “cheese” dip. Sometimes you just want creamy, buttery goodness that’s a little more on the indulgent side. If that’s the case, then this is the dip for you.  The base is garlic, vegan butter (or oil of choice), unbleached all-purpose flour, and plain almond milk. This roux creates a thick, creamy, undetectably-vegan dip. Next comes nutritional yeast for that “cheesy” flavor andmild green chilis for heat. Blend it all together to create the mostcreamy, luxurious queso dip you’ve ever seen.  Guess what? It’s simple! This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and about 20 minutes to make, so you’ll be out the door and on your way to the party with dip in no time.  I hope you guys love this queso!

Might I suggest a savory dip to offset all the sweetness that’s sure toensue? I present butternut squash hummus! It’s like fall on a pita chip. Who wouldn’t want that?  This dip comes together in about 30 minutes with 10 basic ingredients. It gets its flavor from both roasted and fresh garlic, lemon juice, parsley, smoky cumin, paprika, and a pinch of cinnamon.

0,White Bean Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Bean Kale Salad with Tahini Dressing  I think there’s something wrong with me. I’ve started to crave kale. If I haven’t had it in two days, I get something like a twitch. I need a dark, leafy greens fix STAT. Most mornings, I have a green smoothie loaded with kale and spinach. And if I’m feeling especially healthy, I whip up a Roasted Sweet Potato Chickpea Kale Salad for lunch or dinner. Oh, and Cheesy Kale Chips – they usually call my name around 3 p.m. This is not me bragging about my healthydiet. This is me confessing that I think I have an addiction. Halp.  In all seriousness, I love that I love leafy greens! I know it’s an acquired taste for some. The first time I tried kale was in a smoothie that wasn’t properly blended and I swore I’d never trythe bitter, tough greenagain. Fast forward to today and I literally pick the kale that’s meant for garnish off John’s dinner plate likeit’s the last bite of chocolate cake on the table. This salad takes my kale obsession even further. I addedin white beans, some garlic croutons, and dressed it in a simple tahini dressing. Friends, it’s like a flavor explosion in the mouth. I (literally) think I’m in love.  It starts with a little kale massage to break down the texture and remove some of the bitterness. Olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and maple syrup infuse flavor before the dressing even goes on. If your salad tastes delicious on its own, you don’t need as much dressing! That’s my number one kale salad tip. Pre-season – it’ll get you far in life.  Next come white beans tossed in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and fresh parsley. And whileall of this is happening, roast up some simple garlic croutons and whip up my 5-ingredient tahini dressing. It’s like liquid gold as far as I’m concerned. I rarely deviate from this dressing these days. It’s become my absolute favorite for every kind of salad.  I hope you guys love this salad! It’s: Super quick (30 minutes) Simple (with basic ingredients) Loaded with lemon-garlic flavor Creamy +sweet, thanks to the tahini dressing Loaded with fiber + protein (15 g protein per serving!) Satisfying + healthy &amp; Perfect for weeknight meals and hosting I think this salad is perfect forwhen you’re craving something substantial but nutrient-rich. I personally love big kale salads for lunchbecause it means I’ve already gotten in nearly all of my vegetables servings before dinner, leaving lots of room for things like pizza and ice cream.

0,Vegan Singapore Noodles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Singapore Noodles  It’s rare that I receive arequestfor a recipe I’ve never heard of. But that’s exactly what happened recently when a reader wrote in requesting I remake her and her husband’s favorite takeout dish: Singapore noodles. What? The description sounded amazing! How hadI never known aboutthis unique dish? After trying it for myself, I’m an instant convert. Drop what you’re doing, and get on board. Let’s venture into uncharted (delicious food) territory together!  Singapore noodles isn’t necessarily a dish that originatedin Singapore. I liken it to one of the manyChineserestaurant menu itemsI orderthat likelyaren’t traditionalChinese dishes at all. No matter the origin or history of this dish, what you need to know is this: It’s like a cross between curry and pad Thai. It’s got noodles. It’s got vegetables. Its flavor comes froma tangy-sweet sauce +curry powder. It’s insanely delicious. Ya dig?  Based on my research, there are some not-so-common ingredients in Singapore noodles like Shaoxing wine and fish sauce that I didn’t want to a) hunt down, and b) attemptto veganize. So I crossed my fingers, tried making it without them, and (much to my surprise) discovered you don’t really need them at all. With thatbeing said, this is my inspired version. SinceI don’t havean authentic version to compare it to, this might not match your favorite restaurant’sversion. But, what I can promiseis that this recipe is surprisingly easy, intensein flavor, and 100% delicious.  Speaking of easy to make, this recipe requires just 10 ingredients (11 if adding tofu!) and about 30 minutes to prepare. Another perk? You likely have the ingredients in your kitchenright now: Rice noodles (thin or vermicelli) Onion Red pepper Snow peas Curry powder Soy sauce (or tamari) Lime juice Garlic Coconut sugar Sesame Oil (Tofu – optional) While most of the recipes I foundincluded pork or shrimp, I kept mine vegan by simply leaving these out. But I must say, the addition of mycrispy, baked tofu adds extra protein and texture and takes this recipe to a whole new level of awesome. I think you guys are going to love this dish! It’s: Flavorful Satisfying Comforting Curry-infused Slightly spiced Perfectly sweet &amp; Quick Keep this recipe on hand for easy, fastweeknight meals. I also think it’d be great for entertaining a crowd, especially if you have vegan andgluten-free friends. If you do try this dish, let us know!

I’m not.  This may technically be a sweet potato casserole, but it’s my modern take. For one, there’s little-to-no (vegan) butter involved. Second, it’s naturally sweetened with maple syrup and coconut sugar. Third, I added butternut squash for true autumnalflavor. Lastly, I replaced the marshmallows with coconut sugar-toasted pecans. I think your Aunt Sally would still be proud if you brought this to the dinner table, even though it’s hippie-approved. Plus, it’s simple requiring just 10 basic ingredients and about 1 hour to prepare.  Most importantly, it tastes amazing.

0,Pesto Spaghetti Squash Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spaghetti Squash Pasta with Basil Pesto  Do you remember the first time you triedspaghetti squash (if ever)? I do.I was in college and my mom, sister, and I were all under the same roof. It was the heightof “low carb” mania, which I never much subscribed to, but my mom was super into the idea of having pasta-free spaghetti, so we gave it a shot. Much to my surprise, I actually really liked it. The texture of spaghetti squash is tender and the flavor is subtle, lending itself extremely well to pasta sauce and pesto. I still don’t buyinto the low-carb thing, because, bread. But I am a fan of eating more vegetables whenever possible. So, spaghetti squash pasta it is!

This pesto is full of flavor and distributes beautifully throughout the “noodles,” for a light-yet-satisfying dish.

Are you visiting a pumpkin patch, an apple orchard, or making all of the pies? I hope so. This month is an exciting one for us as we’re travelingto Europe with friends. We’ll be visiting Greece, Croatia, and Poland, as well as a couple cities for brief stopovers (follow along on Instagram!). I’m rather excited, as Greece has been one of countries I’ve been wanting to visit for years now (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, anyone?). I hope it’s dreamy and beautifuland everything I’ve imagined it to be. If not, we’ll at least eat lots of yummy food and come home with new experiences and stories.  Speaking of travel, this dip is inspired by a recent trip we took to Seattle. We met a new friendto explore the city’s food sceneand, of all the dishes we shared, I must say the smoky eggplant dip we had at a little wine bar was my favorite. One biteofthis creamy, smoky, deep red eggplant dip and I was hooked. I asked the waiter about the ingredients (as I often do), and I tried to make mentalnote of everything he said.  Once I got home, I started experimenting and it only took me a couple of tries to nail it! I’m super pleased with the results and hope you will be, too. This dip is not only extremely delicious, it’s also quite simple to make, requiring just 9 ingredients and about1 hour to prepare. If you’ve tried any of my other eggplant dishes (thePersian Eggplant Dip, Simple Baba Ganoush, Caramelized Onion Mac n Cheese, or Cashew-less Vegan Queso), you’re familiar with my go-to cooking method of slicing, salting to remove bitterness, and then roasting. I’ve found it’s the best way to get that roasted, smoky flavor without cooking your eggplant over an open flame (which is idealfor those of us without a fire pit or gas stove). Next comes smoked paprika, harissa paste, and roasted garlic fordepth of flavor and a little heat, as well as some lemon juice to bringbrightness and acidity.  The result is the dip of my dreams. It’s: Creamy Savory Smoky Spicy Insanely flavorful &amp; Perfect for fall This dip is best served with toasted pita chips or whole grain bread to offset the creaminess, though vegetables are a great gluten-free option as well. Make this dip as an appetizer for fall parties, a healthy snack, or even to use as a sandwich spread. If you do give it a try, let us know!

I’d especially love to hear fall and holiday requests, as well as any dishes you’ve enjoyedwhile travelingthat you’d love for me to recreate. Cheers, friends!

0,Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl | Minimalist Baker,"Dark Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl  Truth be told, quinoa isn’t my first pick when it comes to grains. However, whendisguisedas a brownie-esque breakfast bowl, I’m all in. If chocolate is involved, say no more.  This breakfast bowl is incrediblysimple, requiring just 7 ingredients, 30 minutes, and 1 pot to prepare. I’m typically an oats or granola fan, but the amount of protein and staying power in quinoa is hard to ignore – 1 cup cooked contains about 8 grams protein, 5 grams fiber, and tons of iron and magnesium! I can’t think of a better way to start the day.  In addition to being nutrient-dense, this breakfast bowlisalso naturally sweetened with maple syrup and rich with antioxidantsthanks to cocoa powder. Fresh fruit and a square of dark chocolate make the perfect toppings. I hope you guys love this bowl! It’s: Chocolaty Not toosweet Hearty Warm Comforting &amp;Perfect for fall If you’ve been wary of quinoa porridge in the past, I challenge you togive this one a try! The chocolate flavor makes this bowl irresistible, especially with a little melted dark chocolate on top. Talk about good morning. If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Peanut Butter Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crunchy Peanut Butter Granola Bars  Do you ever have one of those days where nothing seems to be going right? I had one of those days recently when I was making these granola bars, partially because of mythree failed attempts at this recipe! Yes, three. Who fails at granola bars? I do.  I desperately wanted to make baked granola bars. Doesn’t it just sound dreamy? Well, you know what happens when you bake granola bars (at least in my experience)? They become dry and crumbly, and you’re left with a big pan of granola – not what I’mgoing for. Any advice on this matter? I’d love to know. In the meantime, back to the drawing board.  Instead of giving up altogether (which I did consider), I looked back on my favorite granola bar recipe for a little inspiration and found just what I needed. There’s no need to bake your granola bars once they’re formed in the pan. The only baking requiredis for toasting the oats and nuts to give them more flavor and crunch. Dates provide the “glue” to hold these together and keep them 100% naturally sweetened. The best part?This recipe is simple: 8 ingredients, 20 minutes (plus chilling), and easy-to-mastermethods.  These granola bars areeverything I’d hoped for! They’re: Super crunchy Speckled with oats + coconut Peanut buttery Vegan + GF Naturally sweetened &amp; Delicious These make the perfect easy breakfast or on-the-go snack. They would be especially ideal for hiking, camping, and whenever you need a post-workout nibble. If you try this recipe, let me know what you think!

0,Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Arancini | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sun-Dried Tomato &amp; Basil Arancini (Vegan)  I’m sureyou’re probably thinking, ‘What the heck is arancini?’Great question. Arancini is an Italian dish consisting of rice balls stuffed with cheese, coated in bread crumbs, and deep fried. The result is a crispy, savory ball of goodness with acheesy center, perfect for dipping intomarinara sauce. Pretty awesome, right? I thought so, too. Which is precisely why I wanted to experience them for myself. To the experimental vegan kitchen we go!  This recipe starts with cauliflower. Did you know this cruciferous vegcan be made into rice? So cool. I wanted to usecauliflower rice as the base to keep this dish lighter and healthier. Spoiler alert: It totally worked.  The flavor in this 10-ingredient dish comes from vegan parmesan cheese (my trusty kitchen companion), sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and garlic. Panko bread crumbs createthe perfect coating for browning and crisping the edges.  What do they taste like? Little bites of Italian food heaven. They’re: Savory Flavorful Tender on the inside Crispy on the outside Satisfying &amp; Surprisingly healthy Think Italian vegan“meatball,” but only more tender and somehow more delicious. These make the perfect side dish or appetizer for Italian night or when you want a heartysnack. I would bet money that kids would gobble these down without guessing they were eating mostly cauliflower. Sneaky vegetable placement for the win. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Butternut Squash Veggie Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butternut Squash Veggie Pizza  I rarelyspeak of love when it comes to pizza. Don’t get me wrong. I really, really like it, but pizza is pizza as far as I’m concerned.Nothing too special – it’s bread, sauce, and toppings. But this pizza? Totally swoon-worthy becauseit all starts with a buttery, bright orange butternut squash (!!!) sauce.  This recipe is inspired bymy favorite slice at Hot Lips Pizza in Portland (see our full Portland Dining Guide here!). Their offeringschange from time to time, but the one constant is thebutternut squash sauce. I wasn’t sure what to think at first, but it was love at first bite. The butternut squash createsa creamy, buttery, savory-sweet base that I adore. And that’s saying a lot from a die-hard tomato sauce addict! Bonus? It’s just 5 ingredients and simple to make.  Once your sauce is made, it’s onto the veggies and crust. I typically go for store-bought pizza dough because it’s so easy and keeps this recipe to just 10 ingredients. But feel free to make your own if you prefer (find our gluten free version here). The real magic is in the sauce.  For toppings, I went with broccolini, red onion, and chickpeas for a little added protein and fiber. I also tried vegan mozzarella cheese on this pie, but I still prefer my homemade Vegan Parmesan Cheese! It’s literally the best and saves my dairy-free life when it comes toItalian food.  I am in LOVE with this pizza. It’s: Flavorful Fall-inspired The perfect balance of savory +sweet Loaded with veggies Satisfying &amp; Simple This is the perfect dish when you’re craving pizza but want something new and different. Plus, you’ll have leftover butternut squash sauce for future pizzas or to turn into soup (like this Simple Pumpkin Soup) or pasta (like this Roasted Red Pepper Pasta).

0,Toasted Pumpkin Muesli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Toasted Pumpkin Muesli  What do you guys think? Is it too early for pumpkin things? Please sayno, because I’ve patiently been waiting forfall to arrive, and for me, it’s close enough. Ican’t containmy excitement any longer. Let’s get seasonal! I’ve made muesli bread before (serious yum) but have never gone aboutmaking it into a traditional cereal. I figured I at least owed you all that much, especially considering I’ve nearly exhausted all flavors ofgranola (story of my life). Muesli is similar togranola, onlyit’s typically unsweetened, includes no oil, and it’s raw. But for me, the idea of raw oatsisn’t too appealing(unless they’re soaked overnight). So, I went for a light toast to add more flavor and crunch.  This recipe comes together in 20 minutes and requires less than 10 ingredients. Plus, it’s healthy! With no added sugar or oil, it’s the perfect way to start your day with plenty of fiber, healthy fats, and protein (nearly 9 grams protein per 1/2 cup).  The addition of dried fruit addssubtlesweetness, whilepumpkin pie spice and pepitas infuse plenty of fall flavor. I can hardly contain myself with pumpkin pie spice. I’ll be putting it on everything from now until Christmas – noteven kidding. If you try this recipe, let us know!

0,Vanilla Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vanilla Bean Coconut Ice Cream  Have I ever told you I used to subsist on ice cream as a child? Because I totally did. Imagine 7-year-old mesneaking in a twist coneevery chance I got (and believe me,Igot a lot of chances). The funny thing is I was lactose intolerant for the better part of my early childhood, which means somewhere along the line I decided I was going to eat dairy anyway and I don’t think my parents had theheart to tell meno. So ice cream it was, until several years ago when my bodyshut the whole operation down. Sad day. Good news, though – I don’t even miss it anymore! Especially not with dairy-free alternatives like vegan parmesan cheese, coconut whipped cream, and ice creams like this one that are classic, creamy, and undetectably vegan!   I’ve been wanting to make a vanilla coconutice cream for a long time now, seeing as I’ve only done flavors up to this point (see all of them here). This version is so simple and quite possibly my favorite yet! It requires just 5 basic ingredients and simple methods. There’s even anoption for those of you who don’t own an ice cream maker in the notes. I went cashew-less here to highlight the coconut flavor and stuck to the basics: Coconut milk Vanilla bean Vanilla extract Organic cane sugar Sea salt  This ice cream just screams vanilla, infused with both vanilla bean and vanilla extract. Not only does this combination addmore flavor, the extract (which typically contains alcohol) helps prevent ice crystals. The result is theperfectcreamy, dreamy coconut ice cream.  You’re going to LOVE this ice cream.It’s: Super creamy Coconutty Vanilla-infused Perfectly sweet Simple Classic &amp; Delicious This is the perfect ice cream to make when you want a basic non-dairy ice cream.

0,Easy Vegan Ramen | Minimalist Baker Recipe,"Easy Vegan Ramen  Yes, ramen that’s (undetectably) vegan and totallydoable. Get your soup bowls, friends. It’s happening! While I was doing some freelance work in Kansas last year, John visited Japan and ate his way through Tokyo (jealous much?). One of his favorite dishes was ramen, which he has been on the hunt for stateside ever since. While several restaurants in Portland offer a great bowl oframen, most of them are not vegan-friendly. So I wanted to try my hand at this somewhat complicated, soul-warmingsoup. Spoiler alert? Itturned out to be not that complicated at all!  This 10-ingredient recipe starts with the broth. Ramen broth can be made many different ways, but to keep mine vegan-friendly I went with vegetable broth infused with ginger, onion, garlic and dried shiitake mushrooms (which you can find at most grocery (and all Asian) stores). To add more depth and that“umami” flavor, I also added a bit of soy (or tamari) sauce and white miso paste. The result was magic. Friends, I think I’m in love.  While your broth simmers, prepare any desired toppings. I went with 10-minute flash “fried” crispy tofu, miso-glazed carrots, and baby bok choy. Green onions also providea colorful, crunchy finish, while chili garlic sauce addsheat.

0,How to Make Cauliflower Rice | Minimalist Baker,"How to Make Cauliflower Rice  Cauliflower is such a versatile vegetable andI’ve grown to love experimenting with it. One of my favorite things to do with this cruciferous vegetable is to turn it into “rice.” Because rice can often leave dishes feeling heavy, it’s nice to substitute a vegetable where a starch would usuallybe. In addition, it’s a great way to squeeze more servings of vegetables into your day.  There are two techniques for making cauliflower rice. You can either use a box grater withthe medium-size holes (pictured below) traditionally used for cheese, or a food processor with the grater blade to blitz it into small pieces. With both techniques you’re aiming for little pieces the size of rice. One additional step I like is to pressany excess moisture from the rice by transferring the cauliflower rice to a large paper towel or absorbent dish towel and squeeze/press to remove any remaining water. This ensures no excess moisture remains, which can make your dish soggy.   Once you have your cauliflower rice, it’s easy to cook! Simply sautéin a large skillet over medium heatin 1 Tbsp oil. Use a lid to cover so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Cook for a total of 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, then season as desired (such as with soy sauce or salt and pepper).

Pair these two witha bed of greens and my favorite 3-ingredient tahini dressing, and what you have is mealtime magic. Bonus? This whole reciperequires just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice), androughly 40 minutesto prepare.  This concept was inspired by my Sweet Potato Chickpea Buddha Bowl, which has become a fan favorite on the blog! I must say, you all have very goodtaste. I morphed the Buddha Bowl into a salad to achievea lighter texture,more greens, and maintain thatsame big flavor. It’s become my new go-to dinner.  I think you all are going toLOVE this salad. It’s: Hearty Flavorful Crispy + tender Naturally sweet Subtly spiced Healthy Quick &amp;Satisfying This would make the perfect plant-based meal for weeknight dinners or for hosting!

0,Vegan Thai Iced Tea | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Thai Iced Tea  There are so many delicious things in this world that I wish I could enjoy if it wasn’t for my dairy sensitivity. One of thosethings is Thai Iced Tea. Say hello to the holy grail of iced teas.  Have you ever triedit? It’s traditionally a vanilla-scented black tea that’s been brewed strong, sweetened with sugar, and topped with condensed milk. Holy yum. Want to know a secret? You can make it yourself with basic black tea, keep it naturally sweetened with things like maple syrup or coconut sugar, and get that essential creaminess withlight coconut milk. OK, now we’re talking.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients (plus water), and is remarkably close to what you’d find in a Thai restaurant. While you can findauthentic Thai Iced Tea mixes at the store and online, I’ve found they typically contain dyes and I wanted to keep mine natural, simple and accessible to everyone. All you really need is black tea (loose leaf or bagged), vanilla extract, a natural sweetener of choice (I used a mix of muscovado sugar and maple syrup), and coconut milk! Can we just talk about the creaminess going on here? I mean, can we talk about it?  This tea is amazing! It’s: Ice cold Refreshing Flavorful Vanilla-infused Naturally sweetened Super creamy Easy &amp; Luxurious Make this drink to go alongside your favorite Thai dishes like Pad Thai Spring Rolls, Healthy Thai Carrot Soup, or this Thai Kale Salad. It’s also delicious on its own! Or (serious hack), add a bit of dark rum and enjoy it as a cocktail. Trust me, you need this drink in your life. If you make this drink, let us know what you think!

I enjoy dark chocolate most evenings and love trying new vegan brands. But I’d been wanting to makemy own for a while now, especially since procuring cocoa butter for these glorious cheesecakes. Plus,I knew I could make it refined-sugar free and load itup with my favorite toppings. Verdict: So good. So easy. At this point I’m basicallyoperating a chocolate factory out ofmy apartment.

0,Peanut Butter Overnight Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Overnight Oats  Do you have any siblings? I have one. Her name’s Andrea and she’s my bigsister. She’s a mom of two, a Scandinavian-looking beauty (think bright blonde hair, bigblue eyes), and a seriously funny human being. I think I’ve stolen all my best jokes from her (sshhhh, don’t tell). I may have only one sibling, but she’s my favorite.  When your busy, seriouslyamazing sister who’s chasing around two beautiful kids (4 and 2 years old) all day asks if you could make her an overnight oats recipe to make morning mealtime easier, for goodness sake, you make the woman some overnight oats. If I think waking up at 7am is a travesty, I can onlyimagine how much work it is to raisetwo human beings! A simple breakfast of overnight oats to the rescue.  I tried overnight oats many years ago when they first became a “thing” in the blogosphere. Admittedly though, I haven’t tried them since. I think it’s because if given the choice, I do prefer steel-cut oats. But with this summer heat wave we’re experiencing, I couldn’t think of abetter time to give this heat-free version another go. Spoiler alert: I’m so glad I did.  This version is as simple as it gets:5 ingredients,5 minutes prep time, no fancy methods, and simple ingredients. Almond milk, maple syrup and salted peanut butter make a creamy,flavorful base to soak the oats. Chia seeds add nutrition, a little crunch, and help them thicken. The results areamazing!These oats are: Creamy Hearty Healthy Perfectly (and naturally) sweet Peanut buttery Satisfying &amp; Absolutelydelicious  I lovehow overnightoats seem to keep the integrity of the oat intact, helping to avoidthat gummy texture that cooked versions sometimes take on. And after a little testing, I’m happy to report that this simple, straight-forward version truly yields the best results! I even tried partially cooking the oats with warm almond milk before refrigerating, but much preferred this completely raw version. These oats wouldmake the perfect make-ahead breakfast or snack, especially for those of you with hecticmornings. I also think it would make the perfect meal to enjoy after an intense workout – hello 15 grams of protein!

I’m a sucker for anything cornbread and blackberry, so recreating these at home was a no-brainer.  While Bijou’s version was only slightly infused withcornmeal, I desired a heartier texture.

This fruit salad is inspired by three things: 1) The mangoserved with chili powder at Indian restaurants. 2) My love ofall things spicy-sweet. 3) John’s suggestion to make a spicy fruit salad.

This recipe was inspired by a recent trip to Trader Joe’s, when Idiscovered yet anotheramazing food item I’d never seen before: Cheesy kale chips! One bite in =mind blown.

0,Grillable Veggie Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Grillable Veggie Burgers You guys, I don’t even know where to start, other than, I MADE A VEGGIE BURGER THAT’S GRILLABLE. All hail theveggie burger!  If you’ve followed Minimalist Baker for a while, you know I’ve made many veggie burgers in the past – exhibit A, B, C, D, andE. Yes, it’s an obsession – I know. But none of these burgers have been truly“grillable” due to their fragile texture. And because we aren’t currently grill owners, I usually opt for baking or sautéing anyway. Recently, however we’ve been attendingmore summer BBQs and I’ve been receiving emails from people asking for a burger that will hold up on the grill. Friends, I’ve found the solution. Bonus? It’s so easy.  This burger requires just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and comes together in 30 minutes (once yourbrown rice is cooked). Plus, the method is sosimple: Blend toasted walnuts with spices Sauté onion Mash black beans Add remaining ingredients Stir/mash like a madwoman/madman. All that’s left to do is form them into patties and fire up the grill (or skillet).  I tested these burgers on both the grill and skillet andam happy to reportthey’re fabulous either way. You do get a bit more “char” and blackening onthe grill, whereaswith sautéing you get a more evenly browned surface. So pick and choose by whichtexture you prefer.  You guys are going to LOVE these burgers! They’re: Hearty Simple Super flavorful Satisfying Loaded with healthy ingredients Crowd-pleasing &amp; Seriously tasty Oh, and did I mention each burger (one of five) has nearly 14 grams of protein?!

0,Easy Traditional Red Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Traditional Red Sangria  I had the best sangria(and patatas bravas) of my life when we went to Spain in 2013. Perhaps my recollection of thatfirst drink is slightly biased. We’d just arrived to Barcelona from a long, tiring train ride, and then walkedwhat seemed like miles carrying 40-pound backpacks into the city to reach our AirBnB. We were tired and hangry, to say the least. Our first thought upon dropping our bags was “tapas and sangria.”So off we went in search of sustenance, and what we found was glorious.  Can we all just agree the Spanish do it well, “it” being everything? Traditionally the Spanishenjoycoffee in the morning, work a little, take an afternoonrest (or siesta), work a little more, then retire in the evening byeating tapas and drinkinggoodwine with the people they love. Eventually, they slumber only to do it all over again the next day. If that doesn’t sound like a slice of heaven, I don’t know what does. Oh, and did I mention they gifted the world with sangria? Does it get any better than this lush, fruity beverage? I think not.  This recipe is my humble offering to a sangria-lovingworld. I’ve tasted,tested, researched, retested, and what I’ve come upwith is this easy, 6-ingredient, traditional red sangria that’s got everything I’m looking for: Fruit Sweet Dry Lush Smooth Refreshing &amp; Boozy I think I’m in love.  Though there are many interpretations of what “traditional sangria” is, I’ve found that it typically requiresthese main components: Fruit (like apples and oranges) Orange juice A sweetener (like brown sugar or cane sugar) A liquor (like brandy or rum) Bold, fruity, dry Spanish red wine (like Tempranillo, Garnacha, or other Rioja wine) &amp; Ice (for chilling) For this version, I went with brandy because as soon as I smelled it,I immediately thought, “this smells like sangria!” But of course, if you’d rather use rum, be my guest.  This sangria is my new go-to summer drink. It’s: Simple Sweet Slightly dry Fruity Boozy Summery Refreshing &amp; Simple Enjoythis recipe alongside any of your favorite summer dishes.

0,Raspberry Mango Sorbet | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raspberry Coconut Mango Sorbet  When I was a kid, I was a sucker for a good orange sherbet. In fact, orange push-up pops (anyone remember those?!) were one of my favorite summertime treats. When given the option, I’ll almost always choose ice cream over sherbet and sorbet because I much prefer richer, more indulgent flavors (like Sea Salt Caramel). But mydairy intolerance has pushed me todevelopmore of a palette for fruity flavors, which often come in the form of sorbet. I’m slowly but surely getting on board. This recipe was my first attempt at homemade sorbet and I’m floored with the results. If you make one dessert from ourblog this summer, make it this one!  Mango is sonaturally sweet and creamy I suspected it would lenditself perfectly to sorbet. Thankfully, that’s exactly what happened. This recipe is a sorbet-sherbet hybrid, with the addition of coconut milk for an extra-creamy touch. And the flavor? So tropical and perfect I could hardly stand it. I found that the combination of mango + raspberry + coconut somehow = GUAVA, so much so that I almost called it guava sorbet! But, that would be misleading, I suppose, since there’s no actual guava in the mix. So, Raspberry Coconut Mango Sorbet it is.  This recipe is simple, requiring simple methods and just 6 ingredients. It does require an ice cream churner, but the base is so thick and creamy that I think you could get away with just freezing the base and stirring/whisking every hour to achieve a light texture. Not everyone will be on board with using straight up cane sugar (I was hesitant myself) as this recipe requires, but that’s kind of the science of sorbet. You need it to create the right texture and sweetness without introducing unwantedflavors (like maple syrup would). I did a lot of researchon the sorbet(primarily over at Serious Eats – a fantastic site for new and curious cooks) prior to this recipe. And as far as I understand it, the twobest sweeteners for sorbet (and sherbet) are:1. Corn Syrup (not high fructose), and2. Sugar (granulated or cane). I was a little weary to try corn syrup since it’s not a common ingredient, nor does it have the best reputation. (Try asking a Whole Foods employee if they have corn syrup and see how many appalledlooks you get.) So I went with cane sugar and must say the results were phenomenal. Obviously, cane sugar is more “processed” that maple syrup or coconut sugar, but I would highly recommend sticking to the recipe as written. The only alternative sweetener Iwould suggest would be substitutinghoney for up to half of the sugar, since it’s minimally processed, floral,and has a natural thick/creamy texture. However, that would make this recipe not vegan-friendly, so test and substitute as your dietary needs and preferences allow.  Once scoop in and I knew this sorbetwas perfection.

0,Gluten-Free Birthday Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Birthday Cake (Vegan)  A birthday cake? Yes, a birthday cake! Why, you ask? Because it’s the eve of my 29th birthday and I’m feeling a little sappy(and vain). Like whoa, 29 is almosttouching 30. Look out world.  First, let’s talk about the cake: 1 Bowl Simple methods Super chocolatey Mega moist Not too sweet Adapted from this bad-boy Summery Brimmingwith coconut whipped cream Loaded with berries Who’s ready to party?  Second,in celebration of my birthday, I give you 29 things I’ve learned thus far in life:  Sometimes, following your passion actually works. An obsession withfood led me to create this blog (and it’s the best job ever). Orderinga double scoop ice cream sundaepast high school is not sustainable. Life is about so much more than the way you look. Marrying your best friend is the best idea, ever. When in doubt, Indian takeout. (Cliche as it may be) dance whenever the mood strikes. Good friends make all the difference. Listen to your body and be your own health advocate – no one else will do it for you. Stop telling people what to do. It never works anyway. Always play with puppies. Especially the super tiny cuddly ones. Rainy days are underrated. Do the things that make you happy, even when you feel silly. Use your lady balls whenever necessary. You know what I mean, ladies. Travel often – it’s not good to live in a bubble. Besides, the world is pretty damn beautiful. Stand up for yourself even ifit’s uncomfortable. Never go camping. Like, ever. (But dos’mores often.) Getting up early isoverrated. Planning ahead really does help your workflow and sanity. (See my Editorial Calendar here.) Meeting internet friends in real life almost always works out. Writinga print cookbook will be one of the hardest (and most fulfilling) things I’ll ever do. Every summer, get in the water (at least once). When in doubt, go to the ocean (and order pizza). It’s OK to creep out on You Tubers (i.e. Vivianna and ImJenn). It’smynewest form of therapy. Dark chocolate &gt; candy. Live where you love (e.g. Portland, Oregon) Life is too short to work at a job you hate. Brunch is always the answer. But first, coffee (so true). When it’s your birthday, always eat cake (it’s your one legit excuse per year – get on board).   I went with coconut whip“frosting”for summery vibes, but you couldtotally opt for a traditional frosting if you prefer. A few options include my Vegan Chocolate Ganache, Vegan Cream Cheese Frosting, and Vegan Buttercream. Or, keep it simple witha dustingof organic powdered sugar or cocoa powder. The berries kind of make it, especially in summer! So whichever frosting route you decide to go, definitely consider these as a finishing touch.  Make this cake for your own birthday (like I did), or for family and friends. It’s the perfect treat everyone will be able to partake in and fully enjoy. If you do, let us know what you think!

0,Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino  I still remember the first time I walked into a coffee shop as a complete newbie and feeling totally dumbfounded as to what to order. My choice in the colder months was hot chocolate – obviously. But once summer hit, I ventured into blended frozen drink territory. Enter: my love for the frappuccino.  I don’t order frappuccinos anymore at coffee shops. As I’ve said before, they have enough calories and sugar to sink a boatand I’m honestly more into almond milk lattes and straight up drip coffee these days. But every once in a while, when a craving for something cold and indulgent strikes, this is the first thing I reach for. And I can make it way more healthy (and dairy free) at home. This Cold Brew Caramel Frappuccino is adapted from one of the very first recipes on the blog – my Cold Brew Mocha Frappe. Almond milk ice cubes create a creamy base, cold brew coffee injects a jet-fuel surge of caffeine and bold coffee flavor, and dates puréed into caramel add a sweet caramel finish. That’s right. Just 3 ingredients, 1 blender,and 5 minutes (minus prep for ice cubes and coffee) to make this dreamy, creamy homemade frappuccino.  While your cold brew coffee is doing its thing, make your date caramel. See my in-depth tutorial herethat also includes1,000,000 ideasfor how to use it. In short, make it, love it, always have it on hand. End of story.  When your almond milk ice cubes are completely frozen, add them to a blender with your cold brew coffee and blend into creamy, dreamy bliss. Then add as much date caramel as you’d liketo sweeten things up and infuse caramel flavor into the mix. Mmm, I’ll take three, please.  You guys are going to LOVE this drink! It’s: Creamy Chilled Perfectly Sweet Caramel-infused Bold in coffee flavor Simple Quick &amp; Seriously delicious Make this frappuccino for a special morning treat before work.

But aftermultiple rounds of testing, I believe it’s perfected and ready to be enjoyed by all of you. I’ve made two other falafel recipes forthe blog. First were my Better Than Restaurant Falafel, which still rank up there as one of my all-time favorite plant-based recipes! And last year I made these Baked Falafel Burgers, which are all kinds of hearty and delicious. But I was still craving something a bit more traditional. And since I eat falafel so often at restaurants, I wanted a recipe I could make at home and really enjoy. I believe I’ve gotten as close as humanly possible without busting out the fryer – a feat I have yet to attempt.

0,Date Caramel Recipe | Minimalist Baker," If you’ve ever wonderedhow to make date caramel, this is the tutorial for you! Date caramel is so easy to make and extremely delicious, but there are a couple of important tricks to know before you dive in. 1) It’s all about having good, moist, fresh dates. If your dates aredry and hard, they won’t blendas well and will require soaking in warm water first in order to soften them. Otherwise, you won’t achieve that creamy, caramel-like consistency. So, whenever possible, look for the freshest, most sticky dates you can find. 2) It’s all about the equipment. In my experience, a food processor works best to get that ultra creamy, smooth texture. But now that I’ve simplified and only have a Vitamix, I’ve found it’s not quite as easy with a blender. While theyget the job done, blenders just require a little more time, effort and a bit more water to get things going. Now that you have the basics down, let’s make caramel!

Lately my Saturdayshave consisted of a trip the farmers market wherein I grab all of the leafy greens,seedy bread and fruit I can find. Then, I stumble home and tryto think of ways to consume all of said food. This crisp is one of those ways. This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and is inspired by my new-found love for peaches. I used myNectarine Strawberry Crispas inspiration, but this versionis butter-free and hasvery little added sugar.

0,Easy Vegan Alfredo (GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Vegan Alfredo (GF)  I don’t think I’ve ever met aperson who didn’t like alfredo pasta. It’s so rich, creamy, and classically Italian. Plus, it’s loaded with so much parmesan cheeseit’s practically irresistible. So what’s a dairy-free girl to do? Improvise.  This isn’t my first time sharing an alfredo recipe. Before cutting out dairy I made this simple version with garlic ciabatta bread. Then, I revisited therecipe after learning olive oil made a delicious butter-free alfredo sauce. However, both of those versions still containmilk and cheese, and I’ve since created a version that’s completely dairy- and gluten free that’s seriously close to the real thing. Bonus? It only requires 30 minutes and 9ingredients.  The basedis createdwith a roux, which isachieved with olive oil, garlic, and either arrowroot powder or all-purpose flour. After some testing, I’ve found all purpose flour yields a creamier sauce, but the gluten free version isn’t far behind. Plain almond milk addscreamy texture; vegan parmesan cheese and nutrition yeast pack in tons of cheesy flavor; and garlic powder, salt and pepper add depth and savoriness. To keep this recipe gluten-free as written, use your favorite gluten-free pasta. I love Trader Joe’s gluten-free fusilli and spaghetti. But a more traditional noodle to serve would be linguini, which just happens to be my all-time favorite pastashape. We hope you love this recipe!

0,Aloo Tikki: Potato Cakes with Green Chutney | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Aloo Tikki (Indian Potato Cakes with Green Chutney)  Oh, Indian food. I could write an entire novel chroniclingmy love for this cuisine, but even thatwould fail tofully describe how I feel. While I don’t cook it that much at home, we tend to get Indian takeout at least once every coupleweeks. Perhaps my favorite dish is the vegetable samosa. Crispy cruststuffedwith tenderpotatoes and peas, perfectly spiced, and begging to be dipped in chutney. How can you go wrong?  The problem with samosas is two-fold: 1) They’re fried. I’m pretty much terrified of frying anything, so that’s a no-go. 2) They’re quite complicated. It’s nearly impossible to make a samosa recipe that will fall under my simple standards. So, I decided to get creative and tackle the Indian dish that reminds me most of a samosa: Aloo Tiki. Here’s the deal. Yes, the crust is delicious. If you want a fried pocket of dough, go to your neighborhood Indian restaurant and order a whole basket. There’s no shame in that. But if you want to make an inspired, simplified version at home, I have just the thing.  I’m convinced my favorite elements ofa samosa are the tender potato-pea filling, the spices, and the chutney sauce for dipping (read, drowning). I keptthese elements intact while ensuring this recipe was simple, condensingit down to just 10 ingredients (give or take a spice). And to mimic the pastrycrust, I provide anoption of crusting them in panko bread crumbs. This is entirely optional and can takethem off of the gluten-free spectrum. But I found myself gravitating toward the panko-coated cakes more in the end.  And that chutney. Oh, the chutney. So green. So fresh. So perfect. I’ve studied up on how to make a sweet, greenchutneyand it’s actually quite simple. The best grinder for the job is a small food processor. The next ideal option is a mortar and pestle. And lastly, if you’re like me, you can use a coffee/spice grinder in a pinch. Fair warning, clean up is a little messy as I don’t think they’re intended for wet herbs, but it gets the job done! I hope you guys love the aloo tiki! They’re the best way I’ve found to mimic a samosa at home without a million ingredients orbusting out thefrying oil.

His patch always yielded the biggest, ripest, most brightred watermelons in town. When you cut into them you could hear them crack, and theyfilled the air with most hypnotizing melon-y scent. They were loaded with giant seeds that were perfect for long-distance spitting contests. And they were the absolute best treat on hot summer days. Maybe everyone saysthis about your grandpa, too. But as far as I’m concerned, Joe will forever be the reigning champion.  If it’s not painfully clear yet, I love watermelons. But I realized recently that I’ve never tried one in a smoothie.

Would I have it any other way?  It starts with ripe watermelon and some frozen ripe strawberries for a tart-sweettwist. Lime adds a tart kick thatoffsets the sweetness of the fruit.

(Find my standard recipe in our 31 Meals eCookbook.) As much as I love it, Pad Thai can be a bit complicated and time consuming, which is why I’ve hesitated putting it on the blog. But by morphingitinto a spring roll and eliminating anyunnecessary ingredients, I’ve whittled this down into a portable, easy, downright deliciousmeal. This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and roughly 1 hour to make! It’s also extremely hearty and will please the hungriest of guests. Bonus? It’s versatile. If you aren’t into tofu, sub your favorite protein. If you don’t like spicy, leave out the chili garlic sauce. Need something for dipping? Throw in one of mythree (yes, three) sauce options. In other words, I’ve got you covered.  The star of the rolls, in my opinion, is the crispy baked tofu that sautés up beautifully in a bit of my 5-ingredient Pad Thai sauce. But coming in a close second is the rice noodles sautéed to sticky, spicy-sweet perfection before being stuffed into spring roll wrappers. These rolls really are delicious on their own. But when served with a little additional chili garlic sauce, Sriracha, or peanut sauce, it’s elevated to a new level of awesome.  I hope you guys LOVE these rolls!

They’re Flaky Tender Warm Chocolaty Sweet &amp; Satisfying I’ve primarily enjoyed shortcakes at room temperature, but I think these are best warm since the chocolaty is still gooey.

0,Chipotle Red Salsa | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Red Salsa  Being in the kitchen all day often leaves me in takeout moodcome dinner time. “Hi. My name is Dana and I’m a food blogger who doesn’t cook dinner.” “Hi, Dana.”   OK, it’s not that severe. It’s just that with blog recipes and recipes for our (print!) cookbook (due out this fall!), I have a full plate, sometimes attempting three recipes a day! So is it any wonder when John asks me what’s for dinner Iconsistently vote for Mexican food? No, no it’s not. Cha Cha Cha – thelocal restaurantthat inspired thisChili Lime Mango Margarita – also inspired this 30-minute blended salsa. Obviously, they have a good thing going and I’m rather obsessed. Something about chips, salsa and a margarita at the end of a full day just sounds magical.  This salsa – where do I begin? It’s electric orange-red It’s savory It’s subtly spiced It’s blended It’s…perfection I had to make it at home.  To get that beautiful dark orange huge and some natural sweetness, I opted for carrots! But I also think orange bell peppers would work beautifully here. For that classic salsa flavor I didn’t neglect the onion, garlic, and tomato. And for some subtle heat I went with a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce – an item easily found in most grocery stores (and nearly allMexican grocery stores.) Once everything simmers down, I throw it in the blender for an uber-smooth texture. Chip, meet salsa. Salsa, meet chip. Be friends.  You guys are going to LOVE this salsa! It’s: Savory Smooth Subtly spiced Tomato-y Dreamy Simple &amp; Quick In addition to being chip’s best friend, this salsa would also make theperfect companion for pretty much every Mexican-inspired dish, including nachos, salads,salad cups, chilaquiles, breakfast tacos, panko avocado tacos, and, you get the drift.

It’s practically summer, it’s nearlythe weekend, and as I type I have one of these fudgy cookies at my side. In other words, life is good.  I was inspired to make these cookiesafter having such great success with my 5-Ingredient Dark Chocolate Macaroons.With all the fun I’ve been having with coconut lately, I figured I’d keep playing around with chocolate-coconut creations.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 9 ingredients and 30 minutes (give or take) from start to finish. And, there’s no baking involved, hence the name. These cookies really are a 1-pot wonder.  Another perk? These beauties are naturally sweetened with coconut sugar, and instead of butter I relied on coconut oil and peanut butter. They’re also infused with coconut flakes for an extra coconutty vibe. I guess you could say this is a no bakecookie with a healthy twist.  One bite in and it was magic. These cookies are: Simple Chocolaty Naturally sweetened + perfectly sweet Coconut infused Peanut buttery Quick Delicious These would make a great dessert for road trips, picnics or when you need something quick to whip up for entertaining.

For those of you who made my 4-Ingredient Nutella a fewweeks back, you’re in luck! I have the perfect recipe for you to put it to good use. This banana breadrequires just 1 bowl, is both vegan and gluten-free,and gets a decadent touch from a thick Nutella swirl. What more could you ask for?  After some quality time in the oven it comes out looking like heaven in a loaf pan. But resist the temptation to digin right away! Due to the mix of gluten free flours and the flax egg, it’s a bit more tender and benefits greatly from cooling completely. Bonus? It’s even more amazing the next day!  I think you guys are going to LOVE this bread! It’s: Moist Tender Hearty Perfectly sweet Banana-infused Nutella-swirled Wholesome Easy &amp; Quick! This bread makes the perfect take-along breakfast, snack, or even a dessert. I absolutely adore the way the Nutella bakes into the top layer and creates a chocolate-hazelnut crust.

0,Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake  Let’s talk first jobsand ice cream. One of my first workinggigs was at a soda shop attached toa movie theatre – Midwest theaters did it right. I was about 16 and I snaggedthe job “soda jerk,” which meant I scooped all the ice cream sundaes, shakes, apple pie a la modes, and made fresh cherry limeades. Basically, I looked and smelled like a giant popsicle by the end of the night. It was kind of the dream, except for two things: 1) Restockinginvolved lugging dozens of 10-pound ice cream containers around with my weak chicken arms. And 2) being around ice cream all day. Hello temptation.  My favorite flavor combination has always been some form of chocolate, banana, and peanut butter. I’m surprised I never put bananas and peanut butter cups between breadand called it lunch (but now that I think of it, that’s a good idea). We were allowed a minimal amount of treats while at work and only received a small discount on food, but that never stopped me from ordering giant salads during my lunch break and then whipping up a hot fudge peanut butter banana shake for my car ride home. Life was good.  Not much has changed these days. I still love all things peanut butter, banana and chocolate. However, with dairy out the door,I reach for cashew- and coconut-based frozen treats. Another favorite – and perhaps the most simple creation – involves frozen bananas. This recipe is has threevery good things going for it: 1) It requires just 5 ingredients and 5minutes to make. 2) It’s naturally sweetened and relativelyhealthy. 3) It tastes seriously close to a real milkshake!  Frozen bananas provide a sweet, ice cream-likebase Dates a touchof sweetness Almond milk extra creaminess Peanut butter a salty kick +protein +healthy fats &amp; cacao powder antioxidants and subtlechocolate flavor This has been my go-to mid-afternoon snack when I can’t quite make it till dinner or a healthy dessert when I want something sweet.

0,Simple Blackberry Cobbler | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Blackberry Cobbler (Vegan + GF)  It’s almost summer. Can you feel it? When I think of summer, cobblers,crisps, and ice creamcome to mind. Also, bike rides, beachtrips and patio drinks. What about you? This summer I’m determinedto further explore my love for berries, starting with this simple blackberry cobbler. Shall we begin? There’s something extremely romantic and effortless about a fruit cobbler to me. I suppose it’s because it’s a dump, mix, and bake sort of recipe – my favorite kind. I’ve tried crisps in the past but never a cobbler. My family wasn’t big on cobblers, so I seemed to have missed them altogether. Sad day. I was determined to change that. And to ensure everyone can enjoy this recipe, I kept it both vegan and gluten free. Bonus? Just 1 bowl and roughly 30 minutes required. It starts with a lightly-sweetened, 5-minutebiscuit-inspired topping that’s vegan butter-free, relying instead on coconut oil to give it that quintessential crumbly, flaky texture. Then, it’s onto the blackberries, which aretossed in sweetener (coconut or cane sugar) and a bit of arrowroot to thicken. A sprinkle of pecans and coconut sugar finish it off before going into the oven. This is the perfect time to make some coconut whipped cream or soften some dairy-free ice cream. What’s a cobbler without toppings, after all? This cobbler is dreamy. It’s: Warm Fruity Crumbly Tender Perfectly sweet A little tart Simple + quick &amp; Perfect for summer gatherings This would make the perfect dessert to whip up for guests or warm-weather gatherings. It’s so effortless and easy, yet makes you look like a pro, especially when baked in a cast iron – so fancy. The best part about this recipe is it’s versatile: No gluten free flour? Sub all purpose. No blackberries? Sub another fruit (such as raspberries, blueberries, or nectarines) No coconut oil? Sub vegan butter. No pecans? Sub walnuts or omit.

0,Vegan Biscuits and Gravy | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Biscuits and Gravy  In my teenage years, my high school hada late start day everyWednesday, wherein school started 1.5 hours later than normal. AKA awesome. Obviously, Wednesdays were my favorite. Bed bums unite! My best friend Danielle and I had a standard late-start routine: Sleep in. Roll out of bed. Go to our local donut shop. Order biscuits and gravy. (Yes, B+G at a donut shop.) Devour biscuits and gravy in thecar on ourway to school. Roll into schoolwith a buddha belly. Life, was, good. It’s been awhile since I’ve had a proper plateof biscuits and gravy, but oh how I miss it. The flaky biscuits slathered in the thick, creamy gravy – swoon.It was due time Itried my hand at a vegan version. This recipe requires just30 minutes total. Just whip up your gravy while your biscuits are bakingaway. If you’ve never made mushroom gravy, get ready to fall in love. The mushrooms provide a hearty, almost meaty texture and flavor, while thewalnuts add extra protein and bite. And, just like my dad taught me, don’t forget a hearty shake of pepper for a bit of heat.    Mmm. Just look at that tall stack of goodness just waiting to be covered in gravy. Hello breakfast. I am swooning over this recipe. It’s: Warm Savory Hearty Flaky Comforting &amp; Simple This makes the perfect special weekend breakfast, or hearty “breakfast for dinner.” Bonus?

0,White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Lemon Cheesecake (Vegan + GF)  You know a recipe is good when: A) You get hungry all over again looking at the photos. B) You pawn leftovers off on neighbors because the temptation is too much to handle. C) You drop a piece on the table while cleaning up and eat it with your hands. #truestory D) You simply cannot wait to share it. This recipe satisfiesall of the above. Who’s ready for some (vegan, gluten-free) cheesecake!?  After having such great success with my No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecakes, I couldn’t shake the thought that it was the cocoa butter in the dark chocolate that helped the cheesecakes firm up and hold their shape so well even unrefrigerated(a complaint I had with my earliest prototype– still delicious, just a little soft). So Iordered some cocoa butterto test my hypothesis.Spoiler alert – my suspicions were dead on.  This cheesecake is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl (or blender/food processor). And it all starts with a simple, 3-ingredient crust of dates, walnuts and sea salt. Then, it’s onto the filling. This filling is insanely creamy and rich. Bonus? It’s entirely naturally sweetened thanks to maple syrup. It gets its tartness from lemon juice and just a hint of apple cider vinegar. And the subtle, white chocolate flavor comes from the melted cocoa butter. One bite in and my eyes rolled back. That’s when you know it’s a keeper.  I hope you guys love this cheesecake. It’s: Creamy Rich Decadent Naturallysweetened Perfectly tart Infused with white chocolate Seriously close to “real” cheesecake &amp; Insanely delicious I can’t wait to hear what you all think of this recipe.

0,Green Chickpea Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Green Chickpea Curry with Couscous  I love it when recipes are inspired by a fond memory or an especiallyexceptionalmeal. This recipe isinspired by both.  During a recent trip back to Kansas for some freelance work, we spent the evening with my parents at Public – one of ourfavorite restaurants in Wichita. They had a chickpea curry on special and I couldn’t resist. I love trying vegan dishes at otherwise non-vegan restaurants just to see what they have to offer. I was so pleasantly surprised bythis dish and itfar exceeded my expectations.  This dish is a cross between a stew and a traditional curry, with the addition of Israeli couscous to give it more body and texture. It’s also quick and simple – requiring just 1 pot and about 30 minutes to prepare. And it’s extremely versatile (see notes to keep it gluten free). The primary flavor comes from green curry paste – a new-to-me ingredient that will no doubt bestocked in my pantry from now on. It’s a slightly more mild curry with a vibrant green color thanks tocoriander, cumin, cilantro and lemongrass (just to name a few). I think I’m in love.  As your curry simmers away, it’s time to prepare your toppings. I went with pan-fried tofu for extra texture and protein, but it’s completely optional! The dish really is delicious and filling on its own. A few other options include sriracha, bean sprouts, shredded Brussels sprouts, lime juice, and cilantro. So much yum.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this dish. It’s: Simple Flavorful Hearty Spicy-sweet Creamy Comforting So delicious &amp; Seriously satisfying If you give it a try, let us know what you think!

0,Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Wedges with No-Honey Mustard Sauce  Oh, sweet potatoes. Yourcolor, yourflavor, yourtexture, yournutrients. The way your edgesget crisp and your centers remain tender. The way you complement spicy flavorsso well. The way you pair withMexican foodlike besties. The way you’re always there for me when I’m starving but feeling so verylazy. Today, I’m adding one more way to love sweet potatoes. Hope you don’t mind.  Wedges may be one of my favorite ways to eat potatoes. When I was a kid, a lot of fast food restaurants served potato wedges and, besides curly or waffle (obviously), wedgeswere where it was at. The edges get all crispy and browned and the centers remain soft and tender. And with the addition of a little salt, you get that perfect mix of savory and sweet – a contrast I adore. Another perk of this preparation style? Just 30 minutes start to finish and the whole recipe (including sauce) requires just 7 ingredients!  The only thing missing from straight up fries is a dipping sauce. There must always bea dipping sauce. There’s something delicious about honey mustard sauce and despite many attempts, I’ve never able to recreate it at home to the quality and flavor I wanted. That is, until now! A base of cashew butter makesa neutral, creamy base and lets the flavor of the mustard punch through. And in place of honey, I opted for maple syrup asa natural sweetener. The result was perfect.Friends, I think this may be love.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this recipe.

0,Coconut Yogurt Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Yogurt Waffles (Vegan + GF)  My mom used to coax me out of bed in the morning with one oftwo things: Pancakes or Eggo waffles. I pretty much grew up on carbs. Does a body good, right? The waffle obsession continued into college. Saturdays were reserved for banana pancakes after a long distance run. Sundays – a day of utter relaxation – was inauguratedwith two whole grain Eggo waffles topped with copious amounts of crunchy salted peanut butter, sliced bananas, and honey. It was sheer breakfast heaven.  Not much has changed these days, other than the fact that I don’t buy store bought waffles anymore. I am an adult, after all. I started making vegan waffles for Minimalist Baker early on. But when some of our friends needed to eat gluten-free, I started dabbling in the gluten-free variety. Once I got the hang of it, I realized it wasn’t too difficult to make them both vegan and gluten-free.  This recipe is very basic, requiring 10 ingredients and just 30 minutesto make. It relies on my go-to gluten-free flour blend, almond meal and rolled oats. But if you’re not gluten free, simply sub the GF blend for spelt or whole wheat pastry flour for a similar result! And dairy-free coconut (vanilla) yogurt provides a tender texture and subtle sweetness.   I let John sample one of these hot off the press and he immediately said they tasted like Eggo waffles. Serious win! Crisp on the outside Tender +fluffy on the inside &amp; Perfectly sweet This is exactly what I was going for.   For toppings, the options are endless: Nutella Coconut whip Dairy-free yogurt Compote Peanut butter Banana Chia Seeds Flax Seeds Vegan butter Maple syrup Dream big, friends, and top plentifully.

I just like giantbowls of food. A “Buddha Bowl,” as defined by urban dictionary, is “a bowl which is packed so full that it has a rounded ‘belly’ appearance on the top much like the belly of a buddha.” That’s my kind of dinner. Let’s do this!  I first heard of Buddha Bowls somewhere within the vegan (&amp; hippy) community and personally understand them asa big bowl of plant-based goodness, which is precisely what this recipe is! What started off as a mission to make a chickpea breakfast skillet turned into a sweet and savory dish that would satisfy vegans and meat-eaters alike. Plus, it’s simple – requiring just 30 minutes. And it’s ridiculously healthy – loaded with four kinds of vegetables, fiber- andprotein-rich chickpeas, and a maple-tahini sauce that’s so good you’ll want to put it on everything.  It all starts by roasting your vegetables in the oven. Whilethose are baking away, simply sauté your chickpeas to crispy perfection andwhiskup your 3-ingredient tahini sauce. All that’s left to do is put it all together and take your taste buds to flavor town.  This bowlis literally all I’ve been craving since perfectingthis recipe.

There’s a certain sense of accomplishment that comes with working out and getting in two servings each of fruit and vegetables before 10 a.m. But have you heard the new thing about smoothies? You can put them in BOWLS. Yes, bowls. Why, you ask? Because youcan make them into even more of a complete meal with the simple addition of a few blend-in ingredients and toppings. Count me in!  This smoothie bowl is absolutely delicious. Plus, it’s simple (as always), requiring just 10 minutes to make, and entirely customizable. I provide a basic round-up of ingredients for you to startwith so you canthen experiment and make this bowl your own. The basic idea, in my opinion, is to make a slightly thicker, more nutritionally dense smoothie (with things like avocado and nut butter) and then top it with some game-changing ingredients, like coconut, hemp seeds, granola, nut butters, etc. You get the drift. Basically, anything in your pantry that will take your smoothie from tide-me-over snack to seriously-substantial meal.   My ideal green smoothie bowl has: Super bright green color (achieved with lighter-colored berries and loads of greens) Nut butter for extra protein Avocado for healthy fats and richness Flaxseed meal for fiber And natural sweetness from frozen bananas  When it comes to toppings, afew of my favorites include: Roasted unsalted sunflower seeds Grain-Free Granola Unsweetened coconut Fresh berries &amp; Hemp seeds I also think coconut butter, peanut butter, or even a crumbled-up Coconut Berry Muffin would be amazing!

A couple of weeks ago, I had one of those days whereI’d been in the kitchen for one too many hours and didn’t feel like cooking. Mexican food to the rescue. There’s always Chipotle, but one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants just took over a space just a few blocks from our apartment, so we hiked over there to satisfy our cravings. Best. Decision. Ever.  We sat down and the margaritas were calling. We went with a spicy citrus one and it was perfect – tangy and sweet with a kick.One sip and I immediatelyfelt inspired to make a version of my own at home.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 10 minutesand less than10ingredients! And it’s extremely customizable. Use frozen mango (or other fruit of choice) for a blended frozen margarita, or use un-chilled mango and serve overice for an “on the rocks” application. For a littleheatto balance out the sweetness of the mango,I add some hot sauce and chili powder on the rim. But you could omit these if you aren’t into spicy things.  I think you guys are going to love this margarita!

0,Vegan Dark Chocolate Macaroons | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Dark Chocolate Macaroons  For being a former coconut hater, I sure do love itnow. Whether it’s a side effect of giving up dairy and relying more on cashews and coconutsor the maturing of my palette, I’m all for coconut these days. So it was only natural that I tried my hand at macaroons. Spoiler alert – nailed it.  Traditionally, macaroons contain sweetened condensed milkand eggs. But to keep minevegan friendly, I skipped the eggs altogether and sweetened them withmaple syrup! This simple swap kept themnaturally sweetened and still seriously delicious. Another perk? These are easy to make! Just30 minutes from start to finish, and it all starts withblending your baseingredients in a blender or food processor.  Once you have your base sweetened and the consistency of a dough, scoop out Tablespoon-size amounts and arrange them on a greased baking sheet. Then, bake away!  These little guys brown up quickly, caramelizing the underside and giving a slight crust to the outside, while keeping the centers tender. And the last (and perhaps most important) step – the dark chocolate dip!   These macaroons are legit! They’re: Chocolaty Coconutty Perfectly sweet Vanilla-infused Crisp on the outside Tender on the inside Naturally sweetened &amp; Perfect for spring While these may not be as fluffy as traditional macaroons (due to the lack of eggs), the flavor is spot on and I actually prefer the slightly dense texture. So much coconutty goodness happening here. And I’m happy to report that they’re husband approved – a big perk in my books.   If you make these macaroons, please let us know!

Assuming you’ve ever been into a gas station and fell to the temptation of peanut butter cheese crackers, I’m guessing you know they’re a thing and they’re ridiculously delicious. I used to eat them all the time growing up asthey’re one of my favorite road trip snack foods. Road trips + trashysnacks = best time ever. It’s science.  Since cutting dairy completely out of my diet I’veavoided these crackers at all cost. Anything remotely cheese-esque is a no go for me. So naturally, I had to make it my mission to make a dairy- and gluten-free version for everyone’s enjoyment. You’re (seriously) welcome.  These crackers are modified from my DIY Vegan Cheez Its – a serious classic on our site. However, I think since the last time I’ve made them I’ve wised up a bit on gluten free baking and have made these even better! Not to brag and all but, I totally upgraded them.  While your crackers are baking away it’s time to whip up your peanut butter filling. It’s SO simple. Two ingredients (peanut butter + maple syrup) and you’re good to go. A creamy, slightly sweet peanut butter filling just waiting to be smashed between two “cheese” crackers.  These crackers are crazyclose to the real thing!

0,Easy Vegan Nutella | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Nutella (Vegan + GF)  Confession: This one time, in college, I ate a half jar of Nutella…in one evening…after dinner…on Ritz crackers. Oh, don’t act like I’m the only one with no self-control.  This recipe is a reader request! I’m smitten withnut butters and shocked I haven’t attempted one with hazelnuts yet. Things had to change.  This recipe is simple requiring just 4 ingredients and 30 minutes start to finish. It’s also delicious, vegan, gluten-free, and ridiculously close to the real thing. Win-win! It all starts with the hazelnuts, roasted to warm up the natural oils and loosen the skins. Then blendy blend!  It all happens so fast. The nuts turn into butter and then you add the melted chocolate and give it a whirl and WHOA – you have homemade Nutella on your hands! The only thing left to do is figure out what to put it on… Waffles Pancakes Toast Cakes Cupcakes Banana Bread A spoon The options…oh, the glorious options.  I think you guys are going to love this spread! It’s Creamy Chocolaty Rich Perfectly sweet Spreadable Simple &amp; Versatile I tested this recipe two ways, knowing not everyone would want the melted-chocolate version. Although the melted chocolate yields a much creamier, superior Nutella, you can also substitute cacao or cocoa powder and sweeten it with maple syrup (see notes). See the texture/color difference below. Either way, still delicious!  If you try this recipe, let us know how it goes! Leave a comment and rate it.

0,Coconut Sugar Caramelized Plantains | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Sugar Caramelized Plantains  It’s not often that I eat dinner solo these days, but one recent evening when John was away, I walked to our local Whole Foods andwent straight forthe hot food and salad bar. Have you ever been there? That place is like magic!  It was there that I fell in love with caramelized plantains. Oh mama. One bite in and I immediately knew I had to recreate them for the blog. I’m not sure what fats or sugars areused in their version, but I wanted to clean things up and infuse some extra flavor. More flavor is always better in my opinion.  Instead of relying on brown or cane sugar, I went with coconut sugar – a more natural sugar extracted from sap of cut flower buds on the coconut palm. Crazy awesome, right? A lot of you guys have been asking me if I ever use it and have also been subbing it in a lot of our recipes for cane sugar, and it got me curious. So thanks for the tip! I haven’t done much baking with it yet (recommendations / tips welcome), but what I do know is it works fabulously for caramelizing.  This recipe is simple, requiring just 5 ingredients and 15 minutes. And the flavor pay off is HUGE. To ensure the plantains got nice and brown I went for coconut oil, which infuses a little extra flavor. And I doused the plantains in coconut sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt before throwing them in the pan – a cast iron is ideal if you have one.  What happens next is pure magic. The outside of the plantains get all brown, caramelized and sweet, and the inside gets extremely tender and melt-in-your-mouth worthy. Can we say, new favorite dessert?  I think you guys are going to LOVE this dessert! It’s: Warm Super flavorful Caramelized Perfectly sweet Satisfying Quick &amp;Naturally sweetened! I served my plantainswith some coconut whipped cream and additional sprinkle of coconut sugar. So good! But I also think they would be amazing with my Coconut Sea Salt Caramel Ice Cream!

0,Quinoa Spring Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Quinoa Spring Rolls with Cashew Dipping Sauce  If you haven’t been able to tell, I kind of have a thing for spring rolls. For instance: Vietnamese Spring Rolls with Crispy Tofu Rainbow Spring Rolls Banh Mi Spring Rolls Are you really surprised that I now have a quinoa version? I didn’t think so.  These 30-minute spring rolls start with the protein-rich super grain quinoa. Protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, nutty flavor, light texture – any of this ringing a bell? I believe I’ve only just tapped into the potential of quinoa (in burgers, curries, wraps, salads), and I can’t wait to share this new application with you. While your quinoa is cooking away, prep your vegetables and herbs. I went with cucumber, red pepper, carrots, cilantro, and mint. But it’s so versatile that you can use whatever you have on hand. I think asparagus, avocado, radish, and even orange would be lovely additions.  All that’s left to do is roll it all together and then prepare your cashew dipping sauce! This sauce is seriously flavorful, super dreamy and perfect for these rolls. Plus, it’s peanut-free yet mocks the flavor of peanut sauce. It’s straight-up taste bud trickery, I tell you.   I think you guys are going to LOVE these rolls! They’re: Light Fresh Super healthy Crisp Creamy + sweet from the cashew sauce Filling Fast &amp; Seriously delicious I think these spring rolls would make the perfect picnic, beach day or day trip food because they’re super portable.

0,Kale Salad with Tandoori-Roasted Chickpeas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas  Sometimes a girl just needs a hearty kale salad. There’s no explaining why; she just does. So move out of the way and give her that kale salad. She deserves it. That and the chocolate. Give her all of the chocolate.  Since my first few experiences with kale, wherein I couldn’t figure out how tomask itsbitterness or sturdytexture, I’ve grown to love this shrubby green. When prepared right, it makes the perfect additionto smoothies, salads, breakfast scrambles, and dips. I’ve recently been loving it in salads because it’s heartier than other greens – such as spinach – and leaves me feeling full and satisfied. Not to mention, nutrients. So, many, nutrients.  The dressing comes together quick and packs tons of garlicky flavor, thanks to quick roasted garlic! If you’ve ever roasted a head of garlic, you know the struggle of waiting the grueling hour of cooking until itscompletion. Longest hour of my life. But you guys know I’m impatient (30 minutes or lessring a bell?). So I crafted a way to quick-roast garlic by separating the cloves. Then you only have to wait 20 minutes. Guys, think ofall the things you can do with that 40 minutes you get back in your life. Cartwheels, dancing, hugging, snacking. You can do whatever you want with it. You’re welcome.  The other star of this recipe? The tandoori-roasted chickpeas. I made a Masala Tofu Scramblea while back and fell in love with this smoky spice combination. The good news is, if you’re aspecialityspice newblike me, Whole Foods has a Tandoori Spice Mix that’s to die for. I recommend looking for that next time you’re there! Otherwise, I have notes for how to make your own with just a few ingredients.   Once your (quick) roasted garlic-tahini dressing comes together, all that’s left to do is pour, toss, and top it with chickpeas! Then go to flavor town. My treat.  This salad is my absolute new favorite. It’s: Hearty Savory Garlicky Subtly spiced Super healthy Filling &amp; Simple Even if you’re not a big spicy food lover, you’ll love this salad. Think more smokiness and depth of flavor rather than heat. Not to mention, the subtle sweetness of the dressingbrings balance so it’s not overwhelming. This salad would be an excellent entree for a weeknight meal, or for hosting vegan orgluten free friends and family. It’s so heartyit stands on its own as a main dish! Buthummus and pita or naan would make excellent additions. If you make this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment and rate it! It’s so helpful for us and other readers.

0,Overnight Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Overnight Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding  I’m a little late to the chia seed pudding bandwagon, I know. But that doesn’t mean I can’t be an enthusiast. The chia seed hasbeenhaving amoment for what seems like the past five years. That’s probably because its uses arelimitless.   My favorite everyday way to use chia seedsis in place of flax seeds in a Flax Egg, Simple Fruit Compote, and Grain-Free Granola. But upon discovering you could also use them to make creamy, dreamy pudding, I had to give it a go. Consider this recipe my whittled down, super simple version that’s naturally sweetened, vegan and gluten free. Anyone can make it! Plus, it’s so healthy it’s actually suitable for breakfast. If that doesn’t sell you, I don’t know what will (Rhonda). Let’s get our pudding on, shall we? This recipe is simple, requiring just 6 basic ingredients that are totally versatile. This is the beauty of chia pudding. Once you have the chia seed-to-liquid ratio right, the flavor possibilities are endless.   I hope you LOVE this pudding. It’s: Creamy Seriously pudding-like Naturally sweetened Chocolaty Loaded with nutrients &amp; easy Make this the night before for a decadent breakfast or mid-day snack.

0,All-Natural Gin and Tonic | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"All-Natural Gin and Tonics  I’m becoming a gin and tonic girl. Is that OK, Mom? There’s something mesmerizing about how light andbubbly this drink is. So refreshing and simple. I’m not even usually one for dry cocktails, and I’m certainly no gin connoisseur. But come springtime, gin and tonics are practically all I want in my hand. OK, that and margaritas. Tequila, I’ll never quit you.  How is this recipe “all natural?” I’m glad you asked! Most store bought tonic waters have weird, unnatural ingredientsand are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. So lately, John and I have been making our own, all natural version bysweetening with maple syrup, agave or honey, and then relying onseltzer or sparkling water for the fizz. Works like a charm! So fizzy, refreshing, and easy.   This version gets a tart-sweetness from sliced kumquat that’s been muddled with gin and sweetener. However, for first timers I would recommend trying this with lime (see notes) for a more traditional flavor! I’m a sucker for colorful spring produce, hence this brightened-up orange version.  I think you guys are going to love this cocktail! It’s: Refreshing Fizzy Light Perfectly sweet Slightly tart &amp; Simple This has been our go-to drink for at home happy hours (the best kind of happy hour in my opinion).

The bread-making season in our house ended sometime around the arrival of 10-pound me. But can you blame her? She had two babies to look after and who has time to make bread with so much life happening? Well, the good news is, you do have time to make this bread.

I’ve wanted to make a simple, vegan version of Banh Mi – a Vietnamese baguette sandwich traditionally served with seasoned pork and pickled vegetables – for quite some time now. The problem is it’s not a simple recipe, nor is it vegan.I had some work to do. On a recent car ride – often when many recipe ideas hit me unexpectedly – I thought spring rolls were the perfection solution. They’re easy, fast, and fresh, and are easy to keep both vegan and gluten-free. Yahtzee!   This recipe is simple with just 10 ingredients (give or take a garnish)! Prep and cook time is right around 45 minutes, as well, making this a great option for weeknight dinners. For dipping sauce, you can either use the vinegar sauceused to quick pickle your veggies for a lighter option, or opt for a heartier sauce utilizing your favorite nut butter.

0,BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches with Avocado Slaw  I know what you’re thinking. What the whois that? It’s BBQ jackfruit – aka the ticketto reclaiming your favorite BBQ sandwich. Hubba. Hubba.  This recipe was inspired by the talented folks at FuD– a vegan eatery in Kansas City. When we were still Midwest dwellers I had the chanceto eat at FuD several times and was most drawn to their faux meat dishes usingjackfruit. I’d seen jackfruit in Asian stores before and just thought it looked like a giant green eyesore (because that’s what it is). However, I had no idea that its texture lends itself to mocking meat and absorbing just about any flavor you throw its way. In other words, it’s a vegan’s dream food.  This recipe is simple, requiring just10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and 30 minutes! The only ingredient this recipe requires that’s likely not lying around your pantry is green jackfruit, which can be found at practically any Asian market and onAmazon. NOTE: Just be sure it’s young green jackfruit in water, not brineor syrup. This is key to achieving proper flavor and texture.  The process is so simple. Drain and clean jackfruit. Toss with BBQ spices. Saute. Add BBQ sauce. Simmer. Voila! BBQ jackfruit in just 30 minutes that will fool any carnivoreinto thinking they’re eating pulled pork. This stuff is legit.  To add more flavor and texture to the mix, I include a quick avocado veggie slaw that’s easily prepared while thejackfruit is simmering. And for even morehealthy fats and some protein, roasted salted cashews – because who doesn’t want a giant handful of cashews on anything they’re eating? (Shush, Rhonda – just shush.) This BBQ jackfruit sandwich is legit! It’s: Smoky Hearty Tender Big in BBQ flavor Crunchy from the slaw Satisfying &amp; Simple Even the novice can make this sandwich. All that’s left to do is sit back and watch your friends marvel at what they’re eating. I’ll never scorn the jackfruit again, no matter now ugly and weird it is.

0,Easy Raw Vegan Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Vegan Brownies with Chocolate Ganache  As of March 13,John and I have been married five years. We did it! To celebrate I’m sharing 20 random facts about us that you may or may not know. Here goes.  John hates the smell of brownies baking (hence thisno bake recipe). He literally vacatesthe house when I’m baking anything reminiscent of them. I love sweets; he could care less. We both grew up in Kansas. We dated fourmonths before getting engaged. We honeymooned in Breckenridge, Colorado, but didn’t ski once. (We ate our way through townand napped all day – it was perfect.) We were opposites growing up – he was into computers and I was into sports and my hair. We’ve lived in three states and moved 10 times in our five years of marriage! We both think Portland, Oregon, is the greatest city on Earth (where we currently reside and intend to stay forev-ah). Between the two of us, we’ve visited 14 countries since getting hitched. We don’t have kids but are expert succulent caretakers. I’m 2 years older than John. He’ll be 27 this year and I’ll be 29 (cougar alert). We’re lovers ofgood wine and coffee. I have one older sister, John is the oldest ofsix! Before Minimalist Baker I hadmany jobs, includingweb writer, barista, house cleaner, and waitress at approximately 100,000 restaurants. John went to law school and hated it. So I put him to work on Minimalist Baker (wink, wink). We desperately want to visit Iceland, Ireland, and pretty much every other country we haven’t been to yet. We have a Sunday tradition of eatingpizza and watching Saturday Night Live. John is a voracious reader. I can hardly sit down long enough to write a grocery list. While I write the content and take the photographs for the blog, John does literally everything else. We make a good pair. I think he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.   ﻿ Now that you’ve takena virtual tour of our relationship, onto dessert! You deserve it. These brownies are entirely raw (except for the frosting) and superfudgy and rich. They come together in about 20 minutesand require simple ingredients you likely have on hand right now – such as, Walnuts Almonds Dates Cacao (or cocoa)Powder + Nibs Sea Salt  And the ganache? Oh man. It’s butter-free and utilizes coconut oil for an extra creamy finish. While your brownies are chilling, whip this up in about 15 minutes and you’re good to go! Spread it on thick, friends.This isn’t the time to skimp. These gemsare everything you want in a brownie. They’re: Rich Dense Superfudgy Studded with walnuts (and cacao nibs) for crunch Incredibly satisfying Simple to make &amp; Highly shareable  One bite in and I was done for.

Literally, a blanket of pepper. Thankfully, I’ve also persuaded John to jump on the spice train. At this point it’s an all out competitionto see who can win the spice off war. Somehow, John’s winning. Hopefully this hummus puts me back in the lead.  This recipe requires about10 ingredients and 30 minutes start to finish. It beginswith roasted jalapeños and garlic cloves. Then,simply add all your other basic hummus ingredients like lemon (and lime!), salt, pepper, tahini and a few additional spices and you’re in hummus heaven!

0,Mexican Quinoa Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Quinoa Salad with Orange Lime Dressing  Anytime we return home from traveling, I crave big leafysalads and all of the green smoothies. My bodymisses the 24-hour veggie stream it usually receives when I’m home and in control of my diet. So when we got back from our respective trips last week, the first thing I added toour meal plan was a big Mexican salad. So healthy, filling, and fresh – just what we both needed.  We have a pretty standard taco salad we like to eat that includes black beans, guacamole, greens, tomato, onion, lime juice and salsa. But sometimes it’s good to switch things up. This 30-minute salad starts with a bed of leafy greens and is topped with super foods like quinoa, black beans, and avocado. Orange segments and corn add brightness and a subtle sweetness, anda creamyorange-lime avocadodressing ties it all together.  This dressing was originally goingto be a vinaigrette, but I couldn’t resist throwing the other half of my avocado in the mix for super creamy texture. Orange juice adds a citrusy sweetness, lime juice adds a tart bite, and chili and cumin add a smoky heat that balances everything out. In other words, it’s borderline dressing perfection.   I’m seriously smitten with this salad. It’s: Fresh Filling Super Healthy Loaded with super foods, protein, +fiber Flavorful Simple &amp; Fast This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you’re craving something quick and healthy. Bonus? I think this would please vegans and non-vegans alike, andleftovers make a great lunch for the next day. Although it’s delicious as is, I would highly recommend crushing up sometortilla chips and putting them on top for extra crunch. I mean, come on – live a little. We hope you love this salad!

There are literally trees blooming outside our window. I could faint from excitement. Plus, you know how I feel about dessert.Thus the reason we must ice cream. Yes, ice cream is now a verb. Get on board.  This ice cream was inspired by the best vegan ice cream on the planet, which happens to be scooped up right here in Portland at Salt and Straw. If you’re ever in the area, you must try theircoconut caramel ice cream with chocolate candy chunks. It’s what veganice cream dreams are made of.  The best part about this recipe? Itrequiresonly7 ingredients,and it’snaturally sweetened! I opted to forgo the chocolate candy bar pieces because I’m a purist (or lazy). But in my opinion, it’s so close to the original that if blindfolded I may notbe able to tell the difference between theirversion and mine. I think this is love.  I was half tempted to try a sugar-based vegan caramel sauce, but I realized my sea salt date caramel wasavery good thing.Date caramel isentirely natural, quick, easy, and requires just 2 ingredients. TWO. Add bourbon at your own discretion. But c’mon. A little won’t hurt.  This ice cream is delicious like WHOA.

0,Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Aioli | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Garlic Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Aioli  There are so many amazing restaurants in Portland. Living here is a foodie’s dream. We recently triedLardo (a food cart turned restaurant), which has become quite famous for its coma-inducing sandwiches. However, after sampling a few items all I could think about was recreating their crispy fried Brussels sprouts.  They’re perfectly tender with a crisp bite,and are tossedin a creamy, bright-orange “mustard”sauce that’s amazing. It’s quite possibly what dreams are made of. For the sauce I went for spicy with loads of Sriracha. I alsothink these would also be amazing with a creamy sweet “honey mustard” sauce, which you can adapt from this dressing recipe if you’d rather. Either way, the sprouts are where it’s at.  I’m calling these sprouts “Faux Fried” because they’re flash “fried” or sautéed in a very hot skillet to give them that crispy outer edge and tender center. The beauty of this over roasting?No preheating required, and the whole recipe comes together in about 20 minutes, start to finish. Also? Just 10 ingredients including the sauce.   I’m absolutely smitten with these guys. They’re Savory Crisp Tender on the inside Garlicky Dunked in creamy sriracha aioli &amp; Seriously dreamy These would make the perfect healthierappetizer or side dish for any weeknight meal, or to bust out when you want to impress friends.

Why not Gina? (Don’t worry, Rhonda. You’re still my main ongoing-joke squeeze.) I’m a huge muffin fan (yes, in both size, quantity, and frequency of consumption). Did you know pretty much all of the muffin recipes on this blog are a spin-off of the muffins John used to bake me when we were dating? Yes, my man wooed me with muffins, hence the reason our courtship went so smoothly.  I’ve been eyeing the berries at the store for a while now, and when they had a special on blackberries, I couldn’t resist. The thing about blackberries in muffins is they’re so big they make these big juicy pockets in your muffin, so I opted to use a mix of smaller berries as well. But you could really use whatever berries you have on hand – that’s the beauty of it all.  These muffins are not only customizable and delicious, they’re also simple! Just 1 bowl and basic ingredientsand methods required. And if you’re not a gluten-free eater, simplysub the GF flour blend for whole-wheat pastry or even spelt!

My mom made cornbread all the time, especially with chili, and we always had it with butter and maple syrup. Does it get more American than that? Not much has changed. I still enjoy a hearty bowl of chili witha fat slice of cornbread smothered in the good stuff.Crumbly, sweet, a little sticky from the maple syrup. That’s what dreams are made of. The problem is, I don’t like making a whole pan because someone in this house (hand raised) will eat thewhole pan. Solution? Carve it down to just two servings perfect for John and me to enjoy on chili night. Also? Vegan. Also? 10 ingredients. Also? EASY. Party on.  Now, this cornbread is not health food. I’ve tried to make cornbread healthy and it comes out tastinglike tar. Nope. Cornbread should be crumbly. It should be sweet. It should be buttery. It should make your mother proud. This is that cornbread. I’m happy to report that this cornbread is the one of my dreams.

This time I’ll be in Kansas visiting friends and family and tackling a freelance gig while John skips over to New Zealand with aclose friend. Lots of adventure inFebruary for us Minimalist Bakers. Let’s get to the good stuff: dessert. If you’re in need of a last minute treatthis weekend, try these simple, naturally-sweetened Dulce de Leche Pops made with just 5 ingredients. (Bourbon is optional, but c’mon).  It all starts with the magic of coconut cream (or milk) and sultry dates. I could eat dates all day every day – OK, I pretty much do. They work some serious magic in this recipe, providing a caramel swirl that’s seriously reminiscent of dulce de leche. The process is simple, too. Just blend your dates into a smooth “caramel,” add half to the coconut milk, and mix. Then add the remaining date caramel back into the mix,swirl, and freeze! It’s that easy. The result is a seriously delectable, naturally-sweetened vegan and gluten-free Popsicle that’s like ice cream on a stick. You’ll likely wantto eat all of them at once – trust me. This is why you need a friend on standby for help (in both restraint and sampling).  What do they taste like? So glad you asked. They’re: Creamy Smooth Sweet Caramel-swirled Slightly salty &amp; Soooo dreamy These would make a delicious dessert any time of year, but especially when you want something creamy without breakingout the ice cream maker. If you don’t have Popsicle molds, use oversized ice cube moldsinstead! It makes a fun shape and they can beeasilyblended into a milkshake with additional coconut milk (and/or bourbon – c’mon). Live a little – that’s what I say.  We hope you love this recipe! If you try it, let us know: Leave a comment, rate it, or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram!

It was like hearingthe pope swear – mind blowing. Valentine’s Day was just a few days away andafter seeing my friend relish inher bigsplurge, we decided to follow suit. And what would trashy food be without a good comedy flick? Nacho Libreis our go-to choice every time.

They’re too simple and too delicious not to.  These may not be truffles in the traditional sense, but they certainly fool the palette into thinking you’re indulging in a decadent chocolate truffle. The center is made of dates, cocoa powder, raw nuts, cinnamon and sea salt, and semisweet chocolate and coconut oil form a decadent dark chocolate “shell.” Toppings are optional but recommended for an extra something special.

Or maybe I finally craftedthe perfect mix of carefully measured ingredients. (Likely the latter.) Either way, Ifinally cracked the code and I couldn’t be more thrilled to share this recipe with you guys!   The recipe may include more than my usual 10 ingredients by just a handful, but it only requires one bowl!

Plus, have you seen the counter space I’m working with? Where would I put a stand mixer?! Oy.   I think the magic is in the beet puree and blend of gluten-free flours. Beet puree not only adds anamazing magenta color to the batter (that disappears while baking), but extra moist texture and a ton of amazing nutrition benefits like vitamins A, B, C, magnesium, fiber and folate, just to name a few. As for the gluten free flours, I’ve found that gluten-free baking requiresa mixof dry ingredients. In this recipe, that included a blendof cocoa powder, almond meal, gluten-free oat flour, and a gluten-free flour blend. I tested the recipe with two blends, so see the notes for details!In my experience, the blend makes all the difference.  I was so pleased when I pulled theseout of the oven and saw howfluffy and perfectthey were,just like regular cupcakes. The only thing left to do was frost them with a thick, fudgy, chocolate ganache frosting! Whoa mama.

0,Simple Grain-Free Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Grain-Free Granola  One of my resolutions this year is to eat less sugar and grains. I know. It’s a baking blog.But I’m on a mission to prove that eating healthy can be fun, taste delicious,and be disguised as indulgent. For instance, this 30-minute, 10-ish ingredient granola!  This recipe packs a serious punch in the way of healthy fats, omega 3s and protein from plenty of nuts and seeds. Andit’s naturally sweetened with coconut sugar (a first for me!) and maple syrup. Coconut oil helps it crisp up without influencing the flavor.  Because this granola doesn’t have any grains, it’s extremely nutrient rich: 6.2 grams of protein +4.7 grams of fiber per 1/4 cup serving! You can either eat it as is orwith your favorite dairy-free milk of yogurt. Or, if you’re like me and can’t kick cereal altogether, it makes a great addition to bran flakes to bulk up the protein content.  This granola is my new favorite. It’s Nutty Crunchy Perfectlysweet Hearty Satisfying Nutrient-rich Simple &amp; Quick It’s also extremely customizable. Just use whatever nuts and seeds you have on hand and make it your own. I scored some dried wild blueberries at Trader Joe’s, but I also think it would be amazing with dried cherries or cranberries.  If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Sweet Potato Black Bean Burger | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Black Bean Burger  Some days, you just need a burger. If today is one of those days, I’m here for you.  This burger was inspired by my favorite veggie burger in Kansas City found at Beer Kitchen – the amazing restaurant that inspired thisWhiskey BBQ Ketchup. Their “black bean burger” had a modest description but the flavor and texture areanything but. It’s tender without being mushy, not too sweet, not too salty, hearty, and seriously satisfying. On days that nothing sounded filling enough, this veggie burger was the only thing that did the trick.  This recipe not only fillsa veggie burger-shaped hole in my heart sincemovingout of arm’s reach of Beer Kitchen, it’s also simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and easy-to-master methods. Such as,  Bake sweet potato Mash Add rice, black beans, onions + spices Mix Mold Bake  It’s so easy. Are you sensing a pattern here? Simple, delicious, and vegan + gluten-free? It’s practically sorcery.  I wrote the word “sweet” so many times I began questioning my ability to spell it correctly. Update: It’s definitely spelled s-w-e-e-t. Speaking of sweet, this burger is the business. It’s: Tender on the inside Firm on the outside Hearty Naturallysweet Savory Subtly spiced + smoky Simple &amp; Seriously satisfying May I make a recommendation? Make theseburgers and stack two patties on top of each other and make one ginormo burger (as pictured). Then we can be veggie burger bosses together.

0,Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble  We’re brunch people. That’s one of the things we missed most about Portland – it’s somewhat of abreakfast and brunch mecca. Come taste, and you will see. One of the first things we did whenwe got backwas go to Bijou Cafe – our favorite breakfast spot. It was there that I discovered the tofu scramble that t0ppedall other tofu scrambles – a masala-spiced, veggie-loaded, savory scramble that haunted me for days after we left. Fear not, I was immediately on the case and am thrilled to report that I have NAILED this thing down to the very spices.Let’s get to brunching!  The star of this recipe is the tandoori masala spice blend. If you’re not a spicy-food person, fear not! This is a complex spice blend that isn’t spicy in a hot way, just flavorful. I did a little research about masala spice blends and it can get a little complicated so I picked one up at Whole Foods to see if it came close. Secret time? I’m convinced it’s what the folks at Bijou use. But, if you don’t have access to the Tandoor Masala spice blend at Whole Foods, I’ve included a blend below that should get you pretty darn close.  One of the things I love most about this scramble is the exceptional use of cauliflower. Let’s be real, nobody likes cauliflower. But in this scramble, it’s my favorite part! It adds so much heartiness and texture and blends perfectly with the red onions and kale. Kalamata olives add a salty touch that brings the whole thing together.   My favorite part – it’s simple! 30 minutes 9 ingredients No fancy methods required If you can roast veggies and shake on spices, you can make this dish!  And make it you should. It’s: Hearty Flavorful Savory Perfectly spiced Loaded with veggies Protein-packed Complex but simple to make Quick &amp; Satisfying Here’s the thing, I think I’ve made this recipe so close to the original at the restaurant that I like mine a little more!

0,Vegan Protein Sources | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"15 Vegan Protein Sources + Easy Hummus Toast  When I first started experimenting with vegetarianism and later veganism, one of the most difficultparts was figuring out how to getenough protein in my diet, and more importantly, how to get protein from a broad and healthy range of sources. Trust me, if it was healthy to survive on peanut butter alone, I totally would. Protein seems to be a murky topic.People either think we’reeither notgetting enough and “MORE PROTEIN” becomes their gospel, or they think weshould all calmdown and eat less protein lest we turn into body-building savages. According to most experts, we should aim to get 10% – 35% of our calories from protein. For women, that’s around 46 grams a day, and for men, 56 grams a day. To be honest, I fall short of that most days, but I’m working on it! I’m aiming to fill up on nutrient-rich sources instead of justchips + guac (so guilty). This post is around up of my 15 favorite vegan protein sources. No matter what kind of diet you follow – vegan or not – this post is meant to educate and inspire!You don’t have to be vegan to enjoy animal-free protein sources. Lastly, it’s not all about the protein – we need to keep our vitamins and minerals in check, too. So be sure to educate yourself and consult a professionalbefore makingany drastic changes to your diet!  Now, onto my favorite breakfast these days! I have been loving my Best Damn Breakfast Potatoes, a green smoothie, and some sprouted toast with hummus, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds! Wow, that just made me sound like the biggest hippie. I don’t care – it’s so tasty and filling! Now for the protein math. 1piece sprouted toast = 5 grams 3 Tbsp hummus = 3 grams 1 tsp hemp seeds = 1 gram 1 Tbsp sunflower seeds = 2 grams 1 green smoothie = 6 grams 1 serving breakfast potatoes = 2 grams TOTAL = 19grams Not bad! What’s your go-to breakfast these days? I’d love to know. Cheers, friends!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/15-vegan-protein-sources-easy-hummus-toast/
0,Vegan Chai Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chai Latte  Do I miss the Midwest? Hmmm. I don’t miss needing a car to go everywhere. And I don’t miss the freezing temps, ice and snow. But I domiss family and friends, our little corner apartment, and my goodness do I miss the chai lattesat Kaldi’s. I shudder just thinking about how good they were. It’s been weeks and I’m having withdrawals. Straight -withdrawals. I suppose it’s timeI learn to make them at home. You see where this is going. From scratchvegan chai lattes at home – we’re doing this.  First of all, if you are ever in Kansas City on the Plaza, go to Kaldi’s and try their chai latte. It’s the best I’ve ever had. Not that I’ve tried anything authentic from the source, but of my many coffeeshop experiences, it’s hands down the best. Creamy Perfectly spiced Not too sweet Foamy Luscious Piping hot &amp; Addictive  I’ve done my best to make the latte of my dreams at home and thinkI’ve nailed it! I even did my research on what goes into those sneaky powder mixes coffee shops use, which they assure me aredairy-free. I still have my suspicions… This latte? It’s from scratch. No powders, no pre-mixed packets, no pre-fab concentrate. We’re going old school.  For this latte you’ll need:  black or chai tea ground or whole chai spices (listed below) sweetener of choice (cane sugar, maple syrup, stevia) vanilla extract dairy-free milk of choice (almond is best) raw cashews (optional for thickening) coconut whipped cream for topping (optional, but c’mon)   Because everyone really wants whipped cream on their latte. I will cry the day coffee shops offer dairy-free whip; tears of joy. The method is simple and allows for customizing. Steep tea with spices in water. Sweeten to taste and add dairy-free milk forcreaminess. Strain and serve. At that point you can thicken with cashew cream and heat a little in the microwave or stovetop once more, and top with coconut whipped cream + ground cinnamon. The result is a perfectly spicy-sweet chai latte that rivals most coffeehouse offerings. If you try this chai latte, let us know what you think (and leave any tips you might have)!

0,Kale Citrus Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Kale Citrus Salad  “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” – Mary Oliver I couldn’t resist sharing thisquote from Essentialism by Greg McKeown,a bookI’m very nerdily listening to on audio while working. This bookcame to me atthe perfect time at the recommendation of my fashion blogger crush, Caroline of Un-Fancy. If you’re into minimalist fashion, you need to go to there. Essentialismis such a good read this time of year, especially for those looking to purify, simplify, and sift down to what’sreally important. It’s so easy to fall intoreacting instead of making intentional choices, no? I believe the above quote puts it exquisitely: We have one wild and insanely beautiful life, it’s going by quickly, what are wegoing to do with it? It’s just the gut check I needed for 2015.  As you might imagine, since we announced we’re pursuing a self-published print cookbook this year I am in fact now working on saidcookbook. That’s kind of how thatworks. It’s aproject we’ve been talking about for a whilenow, and I can hardly express how excited I am to finally be in the midst of it. But can I be honest? I’mfeeling a little paralyzed at the thought of it all. It’s an endurance race and I prefer sprints. The idea ofworking on something for a whole year is utterly overwhelming to me. How doI cope? Am I even capable? Practically speaking, when willI have time to sleep with arecipe list that’slonger than a college syllabus? I was journalingthe other day and foundmyself asking these questions:  Do I need to start doing less? Become a better planner? Get more zen in themorning and the eveningto center myself amidstthe storm?  Yes, we maintain a blog and an Instagram feed and reply to comments and emails and makeproducts, and although John and I do this full time, it becomes daily apparent how quickly time slips by and how little time we actually have to do the things we say we want to do. We usually end up talking over breakfast about what we hopeto accomplish inthe day. The joke has become “Well, I’m just going to do everything on my to-do list and then I’ll be happy.” Guess what? It rarelyhappens.Too much stuff, not enough time, and more importantly, not enough intention.  This book and this project have me realizing two things:  I need to figure out what is essential for me to do each day. Thatis essential. Do only those things. Then stop.  Sounds simple enough but then it becomes surprisingly difficultthe minute I lift my head off my pillow in the morning. The good news? I’m not actually complaining about any of this – I’m excited. And, it’s causing me to focus and refine – two very positive things. The better news? I’ve found a solution to all my worrying and fumbling: Don’t over commit. Before, I used to put 4-5 things on my daily to do listand that would instantlymake me feel anxious and overwhelmed bytheday’s activities. I’m kind of a work horse and I like a challenge so overloading had become my default. Now, I’m scheduling 2-3 thingseach day. Manageable, achievable, less stress, deep breathe in and out –I can do this. There is still no doubt a mountain of work ahead of me this year – very meaningful work I care passionately about. Nonetheless, it’s a marathon – I like sprints. But, choosing to tackle onlythe essentials each day is leaving me feeling much more capable and confident, and mostimportantly – at ease.  Another thing I’m working on this year? Upping my salad game. Kale and grapefruit are literally all I think about this time of year so it was only fate that they came together in this simple, 30-minute salad with quick pickled red onions and an easy red wine vinaigrette. Loads of kale, pomegranate, red onion, grapefruit, cranberries, and green applemake this salad hearty and substantial and loaded with fiber. If you love quick, crisp salads with a balance of tart and sweet, this is the one for you.   Another thing that influences how I work during the day is how well I eat. I’m busy and need quick, simple, healthy mealswithin reach at all times. Kale Citrus Salad to the rescue. I think you guys are going to love this salad! It utilizes some of winter’s most gorgeous and nutrient-rich produce and is both delicious and customizable. To make it a complete meal, add your protein of choice – quinoa, sunflower seeds, and roasted pecans area few ofmy favorites.  If you’re finding yourself feeling a little overwhelmed these days, take a deep breatheand figure out what’s essential. Then, only do those things (or at least try really hard to). Making this salad wouldn’t hurt either. Friends, here’s to a less-frantic, more relaxed and focused 2015. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/kale-citrus-salad/

In high schoolI remember having a friend run out to grabme a sandwich for lunch. I handed him a $10 and asked for: 1 foot long, 1 bag of chips, and 1cookie. No 2cookies. Yes, 2.

Then comes thesimple dressing of dairy-free mayo, mustard, dill, maple syrup for added sweetness, and a handful of simple spices. Come to mama.  All of that goodness is mashed up and piled on top of hearty, toasted wheat bread with tomato, onion, lettuce, and a healthy drizzle of my secret garlic sauce. Never forget the sauce.

0,Vegan Green Bean Casserole | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Green Bean Casserole  Friends, it’s that time of year to make something cozy and nostalgic and eat one too many servings. For me, that’s green bean casserole – a dish my mom used to make all the time for my sister and me growing up. It’s simple, creamy, savory and healthy because there’s veggies, right? I suspect this was one of those dishes that my mom used to sneak more greens into our diets, despite our suspicion of all things salad-like. But who can resist anything baked in a creamy sauce and topped with crispy fried onions? My mother was (is) a smart lady.    I’ve been wanting to make a vegan version of this childhood classic for a while now, and the holiday seasonfinally prompted me to do so. I’m happy to report that my attemptwas a huge success and yielded a seriously delicious result. Bonus? It’s simple –just 10 ingredients and about 30 minutes from start to finish. Plus, once the green beans are boiled, it all happens in one pan! That’s my kind of side dish.  The magic happens when the crispy fried onions come on the scene – crunchy, salty and indulgent. You can make the onionsfrom scratch, but Trader Joe’s has somethat just happens to be vegan friendly. This saves time and hassle and is totally worth it in my opinion. Look at that crunch!

0,Healthy Peanut Butter Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Granola Bars  When I was in college I was the queen of snacks. I was away from home or my dorm 90% of the time, so I had to rely on quick meals to get me through the day, granola bars being one of my favorites. Granola bars were granola bars, as far as I was concerned. That was, until I discovered the Larabar. Simple ingredients, naturally sweetened, amazing flavors – I was hooked after one bite of the apple pie flavor (a stellar recommendation from my sister – my longtime partner in healthy eating crime).  Though I’ve made date-sweetened granola bars in the past (see my 5 Ingredient Granola Bars, Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Bars, Super Seedy Bars, Brownie Granola Bars), I’ve yet to make a plain and and simple peanut butter version. This simple, 3-ingredient recipe is an homage to my beloved Larabar Peanut Butter Cookie bar. After a recent trip to Trader’s left me in need of a snack, it wasthe first thing I reachedfor. As soon as I got to my car I downed that thinglike a champ and thought, “Yep, these need to happen on the blog.” Well, it’s happening NOW.  These bars are so easy it’s almost a non-recipe. Dates pulsed in a food processor, then mixed with natural salted peanut butter and rolled oats. The result is a salty-sweet dough that can either be rolled into snack balls or pressed into a pan and cut into bars that are super handy for on-the-go snacking.  These bars are seriously magic. They’re: Vegan Gluten Free Peanut Buttery Supa moist Naturally sweetened Hearty Wholesome Salty-sweet Healthy Portable &amp; Yum yum I thought these would makethe perfect on-the-road snack for those traveling next week for the holidays. Though John and I will be cozied up right in our little Portland apartment, eating Shepherd’s Pie, and watching an Office Christmas marathon, I’m considering making another batch of these gems solely for couch-time snacking.  Consider these bars alittle gift from me to you this holiday season. I hope all is merry and bright in your world, and you’re spending next week with the ones you love most. And, speaking of gifts, if you’re looking for giftsfor foodies and aspiring home cooks, check out our Simple Kitchen Essentials post! It’s a top-to-bottom account of everything in our simple kitchen.

0,Creamy Spinach and Kale Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Kale and Spinach Dip  It’s about that time for holiday parties galore, and for that, you need a dip! IfI’m invited to your gathering, this is definitely the oneI’m bringing. I take my appetizers seriously. This cheesy kale and spinach dip is my vegan take on classic spinach and artichoke dip, which is typicallyladen with cheese – my former love. But since we’ve broken up, I’ve replaced the cheese-shaped hole in my heart with cashew cream and vegan parmesanand haven’t looked back. Who needs the real thing when the substitutes are healthier and taste amazing? That’s what I say.  This dip requires just 9 ingredients – hooray! And it comes together in about 30 minutes (once your cashews are soaked). Plus, it hasall my loves: kale spinach cashew cream garlic vegan parmesan All that’s missing is a toasty baguette for scooping. Don’t worry – we’ll get to that.  Once you’ve mixed your ingredients together it just takes a quick bake in the oven to get it piping hot and ready for serving. I preferred a toasted baguette, but you could also serve it with veggies, tortilla chips, or any other crackers of choice.  This dip is amazing! It’s Creamy Savory Cheesy Hearty Satisfying Loaded with greens Super healthy Simple Shareable &amp; Perfect for holiday parties  If you make this dip, we hope you love it! As always, share a picture on Instagram with the #minimalistbaker if you do! We’d love to see this dip in action. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/creamy-kale-and-spinach-dip/

0,Vegan Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Sugar Cookies  I’m not a negative person, but I do oftenexpect the worst in order to safeguard myself from less than ideal outcomes. For example, say we’re planning to hangout with friends. Ithink, “This maygo terribly wrong. I’ll say something stupid. I’ll spillwine on their couch. There will be lots of awkward silence.They’ll never invite us over again.” That way, if the evening goes at all OK, it was way better than I expected! Success! It’s like some twisted way of guaranteeinga “successful outcome” in any circumstance. Aren’t I smart? (Cheekygrin.) Does anyone else do this? Because it kind of makes me feel like some bizarre form of a control freak and I need some more people in thisboat with me. Either that or send 18 dozen of these sugar cookies to help me cope, STAT.  While I’m not able to predict many (read: any) things that will happen in life, I can predict this: Make these cookies and you will fall in love. They are the classic, quintessential sugar cookie all veganized and tender and perfect, just dying to be frosted and brought to all of your holiday gatherings. Your friends and family will forget all about the gifts and nose dive into these bad boys, guaranteed.  These cookies are simple, as always. Just 1 bowl and no fancy methods or equipment required. Just good old fashioned cookies at your fingertips in less than 1 hour.  And when it comes time to frost, get festive – naturally! I tried my hand at DIY natural food coloring using beet juice and it worked beautifully! Look at that hot pink like WHOA. I also tried parsley for “green” but itwas less successful. Hasanyone else tried beets or other foods for dying? Do share. I’d love to know.  As far as the cookies go, you can cut them into shapes or just roll them into balls that bake into perfect,beautiful, fluffy discs. I want them all. The shapes are a little more time intensive,but definitely worthit if you really want to get into the holiday spirit. But let’s be real, when it comes time to pick which cookie(s) to eat, we choosebased on size and amount of frosting (the more of both, the better).  You’re going to LOVE these cookies. They’re: Perfectlytender Simple to make Not too sweet Vanilla-infused Amazing with frosting &amp; Undetectably vegan These cookies are definitely my new go-to for holiday gifting.

0,Simple Tofu Quiche | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Tofu Quiche  The first time I tried tofu my friend baked a block for me, slathered in BBQ sauce and called it dinner. I’m a champ so I stomached it, but I pretty much vowed to never eat the stuff again. Obviously, my opinions have since changed.  Iwould consider myself a quiche fan, but certainly not an aficionado. But I wanted to give a tofu version a try. After mastering tofu in stir fries, peanut sauce, and spring rolls, a quiche seemed like the next step in my tofu journey. And I’m happy to report my experiment was a success; you could say I’ma total tofu quiche convert (it’s what all the hipsters are doing).  This quiche is simple! So even if you’ve never attempted a quiche before, I have faith that you can nailthis version. It requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods even the novice cook can master. For starters, the crust is just hash browns (making the whole thing naturally gluten-free)! And the filling is loaded with roasted veggies (any you have on hand), and a mixture of silken tofu, hummus and nutritional yeastto give it thatperfect “egg-like” flavor and texture.  For those skeptics out there saying, “Yeah, but what does it taste like?” I say, (Rhonda,) it tastes amazing! Seriously, it’s: Savory Satisfying Comforting Loaded with veggies Healthy Crispy on the crust Egg-like in the center &amp; Convincingly close to the real thing I think this quiche would be lovely for brunches and lazy weekend mornings, as well as when you have family in town for the holidays. I’m confident vegans and non-vegans alike would totally dig this quiche.  If you give this recipe a try, let us know!

0,Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse Pie  How is December treatingyou all thus far? Well I hope. We’resettled into our new place in Portland (I’ll be sure to post pictures on Instagram soon!), and getting back into our groove. It’s always amazing to me how much a move can disrupt life. A two-week breakbecomesa month and before I realize it, I haven’t properlyexercisedin weeks, reach for takeout at every turn, and my email is overflowing. It’s moments like these when I realize I’m more of a control freak than I’d like to admit. My schedule is seriously importantto me. Thankfully, I’m feeling a bit more “normal” now, whatever that means in this season of life. We even have our Christmas tree up and I’m feeling quite festive with my“Indie Holidays” station blaring in the background as I work. Of course, a new space has required some reorganization as wellas a few new purchases(for home, office and otherwise), and in the process we’ve managed to simplify and streamline a bit more (which we love). I’m planning to createa “Simple Kitchen” post soon to highlight everything we own in our “minimalist” kitchen to show you just how possible it is to do more with less stuff. Until then, let’s eat pie, shall we?  Have you guys tried our Vegan PB&amp;J Pie yet? It’s one of my favorites. In the process of making it I discovered the magic of date paste and coconut whipped cream mixed together to create a thick, custard-like mousse, perfect for pies and even no-churn ice cream! Since then I’ve been dyingto try it in another variation. Enter: Chocolate Peanut Butter.  This magic starts with coconut whipped cream and date paste. Then a generous amount of melted dark chocolate and a giant heap of salted creamy peanut butter. Hubba, hubba indeed. The result is a rich, thick chocolate mousse infused with salty peanut butter piled into perfectly salty-sweet graham cracker crust – literally the pie of my dreams.  This pie is simple, requiring just 7 ingredients and easy-to-follow methods. If you can master date paste (pitted dates whirled into a paste) and coconut whipped cream (chilled coconut cream whipped into an airy mousse), then you can totally make this pie. And, I highly recommend doing sobecause it’s bomb. Yes, I still say bomb (Rhonda). Deal with it.  This pie is my new favorite. It’s: Creamy Thick Rich Chilled Super chocolaty Infused with peanut butter Perfectly sweet Nestledin a graham cracker crust Delectable Satisfying &amp; Perfect for holiday gatherings and beyond One bite into this bad boy and I was done for. I took two slices and shared the rest with a friend, who later reported sheate three slices in two days. That’s when you know it’s good – you can’t keep your hands off it.  If you make this pie, please let us know! Take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram, @minimalistbaker on Twitter, or leave a comment. We seriously love seeing what you guys cook up.

I simply love this time of year, especially the baking and aromas that come with it. Gingerbread is certainly one of my favorite holiday cookies, so when a reader requested my takeon gingerbread granola, I couldn’t resist.  Since testing this first batch I’ve nearly gobbled it all up and am preparing to whip up round 2. This stuff is that good. You guys know I have a thing for granola, and this flavor is a variation of my original recipe. It gets its gingerbread flavor from the spices and molasses. Ginger, cinnamon and cloves give it depth, spice and warmth, while molasses adds a touch ofsweetness with deep amber notes. I think I’m in love.   As always, this recipe is simple, requiring just 10 ingredients and 30 minutes from start to finish. And it’s customizable!You can use whatever nuts you have on hand really. I went with a mix of almonds, pecans and walnuts – my favorite. I think the only thing missing – and believe me, I was tempted to add it in – is a bunch of crumbled up Vegan Gluten Free Gingerbread Men. I don’t know how I resisted, but it would make this granola practically perfection in a bowl.  You guys are going to L-O-V-E this granola. It’s Sweet Crunchy Gingerbread-spiced Festive Perfectlycrisp Nutty Wholesome Simple Nutritious &amp; Filling If you give this recipe a try, let us know on Twitter, Instagram(#minimalistbaker),or Facebook.

But nonetheless, here we are smack dab in the middle of the holiday season and I’m feeling kind of cozy. Though I normally crave warmer thingsin colder months, this smoothie makes a shining exception with its rich orange hue, creamy texture and warm, spicy notes. I think I’ve learned to love sweet potato in a whole new way.  I absolutely adore sweet potatoes for breakfast in these oats, for lunch in this salad, and for dinner withroasted chickpeas and garlic sauce.

You want to impress them! But God forbid they see you pull out a box mix of pancakes (even though we all do in a pinch). I have just the solution.  These homemade, simple, whole grain vegan pancakes are just what you and your family need. Good news! They come together in 20minutes, 1 bowl,completely from scratch! You will be the breakfasthero after all. These pancakes are wholesome thanks to a mix of rolled oats, whole wheat flour, and spelt flour! Spelt flour is new to my kitchen but has been around for centuries. It’s an ancient grain that has a slightly nutty, sweet flavor. It’s also easy to digest and higher in protein than whole wheat flour, making it ideal for these pancakes as well asmany other baked goods where traditional flours are used. These cakes are also naturally sweetened with maple syrup, and olive oil keeps them both moist and heart healthy. Hello healthy breakfast.  Beyond being healthy, they also taste amazing! They’re: Fluffy Wholesome Tender Slightly nutty Perfectly sweet Hearty Satisfying Simple Fast &amp; Perfect for the whole family I figured for the holidays when heavy meals are on the horizon, it’s great to start out the day with something filling but nutritious.

0,Simple Fall Slaw | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Fall Slaw  Can I tell you guys a secret? We’re moving to Portland. Like, this weekend. I know. We’re nomads. Get used to it.  If you’ve followed Minimalist Baker for any length of time, I suspect you’ve had a hard time placing a finger on where exactly we are at any giventime. We were married in Kansas, moved to Oregon, moved back to Kansas, now Missouri, and now back to Oregon. Whoof. I would be confused, too. But you know what? That’s OK. Life ebbs and flows and interests swell and dwindle and we as people change. It’s no wonder our addresses change, too. Since leaving Portland in 2011, we’ve missed it dearly. A few vacations back confirmed that fact. So we’re packing up and heading west (again). And we’re kind of excited about it. This change doesn’t meanmuch for you guys! (I think we’ll still have Internet in Portland, wink wink). It just means we’ll be in a new place (follow John and me on Instagram to watchour transition), inspired by new surroundings, doing new things. Among the many, many things I’m grateful for this Thanksgiving season, that is certainly one of them.   Enough talk about moving, and more talk about this amazing slaw. It’s loaded with fruits and vegetables in just about every shape and texture, and topped with a seriously delicious tahini-apple cider vinegar dressing that brings the whole thing together. Unsalted sunflower seeds pack extra nutritional punch and plenty of protein. I think I’m in love. Also? 30 minutesis all you need to make this holiday-worthy dish.  What does it taste like? If crisp Autumn weatherhad a taste, this would be it. It’s: Crisp Fresh Flavorful Loaded with veggies and fruit Tossed in a simple, tangy dressing Simple Satisfying &amp; Perfect for holiday gatherings What’s even better about this dish is you can make it a day or so in advance and it just keeps getting better as the flavors meld together.

This year I’m sharinglots of savory options, not just the sweet stuff! (Even though you guys know I love a good pie or two. Or three.) Expect a full Thanksgiving roundup next week. But until then, let’s talk about this stuffing, which happens to be my favorite stuffing of all time.  This recipeis adapted from my grandma’s classic stuffing that my dad has loved since he was a kid, and I happen to be quite fond of as well. It’s hearty, moist and flavorful on the inside, and perfectly crisp on the outside – just like any good stuffing should be.  While her version isn’t vegan, I’ve subbed out the meat for lentils, the egg for a flax egg, and the chicken broth forveggie broth to keep things veg-friendly. (Of course, sub in any of those things as you please.) Despite making quite a few swaps, the final result was surprisingly close to the original recipe! In fact, I think if I served thisversion at Thanksgiving, I doubt anyone would be able to tell the difference. Another perk? It’s simple! Just 9 ingredients – all basic and easy to get your hands on.  This stuffing is my new favorite!

0,Vegan Pumpkin Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Swirl Cheesecake  I once ran a half marathon then promptly headed to the Cheesecake Factory to order a fat slice of white chocolate macadamia cheesecake. It was apparently so worth it I did the exact same thing the followingyear. Though I haven’t runa race since then, I still crave cheesecake immensely. So rich, sweet, and like custard and cake in one. What’s not to love? But my dairy days are long behind me so I set out to vegan-ize this bad boy. Mission seriously accomplished.  This recipe starts with a 2-ingredient graham cracker crust (my personal favorite crust). But tokeep it gluten free, try my Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Menfor a slightly spicier deep, amber flavor. You really can’t lose either way. While thecrust is baking, prepare the two fillings in a blender and then swirl away. Onehour in the oven and this gorgeous pie is transformedinto aseriously legit vegan cheesecake. Jaws will drop – trust me on this one. This pie is ridiculously close to actual cheesecake. It’s: Creamy Smooth Custardy Pumpkin-infused Subtly spiced Perfectly sweet Seriously decadent &amp; Kind of amazing I too was skeptical of whether or not a baked vegan cheesecake was a) possible, and b) capable of topping the glory that is 7 ingredient no-bake cheesecake. Turns out, yes to both (even though these little gems will always have a place in my heart).  While thispie would make the perfect Thanksgivingdessert alongsideour classic Vegan Gluten Free Pumpkin Pie, I think it would be perfect year-round. With a few creative substitutions, I even think pumpkin could be substitutedfor other flavors (like blueberry or peanut butter!), and still be amazing. Yes, experimenting will ensue. Don’t you worry.

0,Vegan Shepherd's Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Hour Vegan Shepherd’s Pie  There is something very wintry, very comforting about Shepherd’s Pie. Hearty vegetables in a brothy sauce topped with fluffy mashed potatoes, all baked to bubbly perfectly. It’s kind of what Thanksgiving dreams are made of, at least in my world.  My family wasn’t big on casseroles growing up and Johnand I aren’tbig on them now, but this recipe may be ouroneexception. Traditional Shepherd’s pie contains ground beef, which I considered swapping for walnuts, a combination of mushrooms and walnuts, or lentils. Being that lentils seemed to packthe most nutritional punch and protein, I went that route! Plus, they cook up nicely while your potatoes are boiling, making the whole process rather seamless.  Lentils are a plant-based powerhouse. Not only are they affordable and easy to cook, they’re also high in essential nutrients like fiber, iron and protein (9 grams per 1/2 cup serving). They also absorb flavors well and can be added in place of ground beef in just about any recipe. That’s great news if you ask me!   This recipe is not only nutritious, tasty and filling, it’s also simple! Just 9 ingredients required and about 1 hour from start to finish. I could see this not only being a vegetarian-friendly Thanksgiving entree, but an easy weeknight meal for colder months ahead. So, what does it taste like? I’m glad you asked. It’s: Hearty Filling Savory Loaded with veggies Herb-infused Warm Comforting &amp; Seriously satisfying I cooked this up and John and I both gladly ate two servings for dinner. We’re not even really “casserole” people, but we both loved the flavor, consistency and simple nature of this dish. This will definitely become a staple for us in the winter months ahead.  We hope you guys love this recipe! If you give it a try, be sure to let us know in the comments, or by tagging a photo#minimalistbaker on Instagram! We’d love to see. Cheers, friends!

0,Vegan Eggplant Parmesan | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Eggplant Parmesan  For some reason, eggplant used to intimidate me. Its floppy texture, neutral taste, andseemingly over-involvedcooking methods made me think it would be something I’d never master. I was wrong.  Since getting my hands on my first eggplant last year, it’s become one of my absolute favorite fruits (yes, fruit, even though it’s a vegetable in my book). Twoof my absolute favorite recipes utilizing eggplant have been my Cashew-less Vegan Queso and my Eggplantand Caramelized Onion Dip. It’s neutral flavor help it absorb flavors extremely well, and depending on how you cook it, its texture is extremely versatile – from super creamy to super crisp. And in this little gem of a recipe, it’s crispy to the max.  This recipe was inspired by one ofmy favorite food bloggers, Izy from Top with Cinnamon. It’s straight out of her beautiful new cookbook, Top With Cinnamon. Although it’s not a vegan cookbook, it has a lot of recipes that can be easily adapted to a vegan diet. And when I laid my eyes on hercrispy aubergine pesto pasta, I knew it was the one for me.  This recipe took a few tries to get just right sans egg, but I think I’ve done it (simply)! It requires just 10 ingredients,employs easymethods, and takes a little more than 1hour from start to finish. It is a little bit more involved than some savory meals I’ve cooked, but it’s one that John and I both love and crave, so it’s worth the extra timeand effort!

0,Simple Vegan Falafel | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Falafel Burgers  I remember the first time I ever triedMediterranean food. I was in college working at a breakfast restaurant and my coworker kept telling meabout her favorite local restaurant that serveda killervegetarian appetizerplatter. Up until thatpoint, I had literally never heard offalafel or pita and had yet to jump on thehummus bandwagon. It was all a mystery to me. But that all changed one day afterwork when she convinced me to join her for lunch. One bite in and I was ruined. Since then Mediterraneanhas become oneof my absolute favorite cuisines. I practically have hummus pumpingthrough my veins at this point.  Though I have mastered the art of Vegan Gluten-FreeFalafel, I’ve been craving a falafel burger these days. There’s something so substantial about a burger, and the flavors of Mediterranean cuisine lend themselves perfectly to toppings and sauces galore.  This recipeis simple, requiringjust 7 ingredients. Plus,it’s seriously well spiced withinfusions from both garlic and cumin for a tangy, smoky flavor that I absolutely adore. They’re also baked for a healthier touch, though I do prefergiving them a little sauté beforehand to formanextra crust on the outside. I’m kind of a texture snob.  These burgersare super versatile! Serve them on pita for a more traditional falafel feel, atop greens for a seriously substantial salad, or wrapped inchard for a naturally gluten-free option. As for sauces, hummus makes a lovely touch! Otherwise, my go-to Garlic Dill sauce is magic. You really can’t go wrong.  I’m kind of smitten with these burgers. They’re: Savory Smoky Garlicky Crusty on the outside Tender on the inside Fresh Simple &amp; Seriously satisfying I suspect even carnivores would dig this dish. It’s so hearty and substantial with nearly 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per burger! That’s a seriously satisfying and healthy meal even picky eaters will love.

0,Pumpkin Bourbon Milkshakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Bourbon Pumpkin Milkshakes  I’ve been known to repurpose ice creams many different ways:Ice cream sandwiches, floats, dessert nachos, and cakes. So how could I possiblypass up the opportunity to make a milkshake? That’s what I thought!  One bite into my creamy, dreamy Vegan Pumpkin Pie Ice CreamandI knew it was destined for greater things. So when I got an inviteto make a recipe forHow Sweet Eats‘virtual baby shower, I knew this was just the thing. Jessica likes all things over the top, flavorful and borderlinetrashy. (Don’t worry Jessica, I’ll drink your share of bourbon this time). What makes this shake trashy, you ask? BOURBON, baby. Lotsa bourbon.  My first thought was to make an ice cream float using apple cider or pumpkin beer, but cider is too sweet and beer is not really my thing. So John suggested a milkshake using bourbon. BOOM. Million dollar idea. It makes thisshake SO tasty. That’s why I keep thisguy around. Not to mention, where would I be without my part time hand model? Da-da-dang, look at those curves.  This milkshake is everything I hoped it would be: Creamy Cold Mega pumpkin-y Super sweet Subtly spiced Thick Delicious &amp; I want more And as always, simple.

0,Vegan Pumpkin Caramels | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Caramels  You guys know I have a thing for date caramel. It makes wonderful things like truffles and No-Bake PB&amp;J Pies, and No-Churn Chocolate Ice Cream. Clearly, there is nothing it cannot do. Exhibit D: Pumpkin Caramels!  These truffles are seriously simple! They require just 6 ingredients, are naturally sweetened, and are both vegan and gluten free. They get a serious punch of pumpkin flavor from both pumpkin butter (or puree), and pumpkin pie spice, and the result is a decadent-but-healthy caramel rolled in roasted pumpkin seeds and sea salt. Serious yum.   If you’ve never tried date caramel,you must! Get your hands on some dates, whirl them in your food processor, add a little coconut oil (or water) until you get the creamiest,dreamiest paste that tastes seriously identicalto caramel. In addition to rolling your date caramel in pumpkin seeds and eating itascaramel bites, date paste keeps for weeks in the fridge and is ideal for adding to oatmeal, smoothies, desserts, and practically anything you want to sweeten naturally. It’s practically magic in a jar for health nuts and the sugar conscious.   The concept for these caramels came to me one night just before drifting off to sleep, as so many of my ideas do. I muttered to John, “Don’t let me forget, pumpkin caramels with dates!” so it wouldn’t escape me. I’m so glad I remembered andgave it a go. I’ve been snacking on these for the past couple of weeks. The best part? No guilt! Dates really do hold a special place in my food-loving heart.  You’re going to love these caramels.

0,Coconut Whipped Cream Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Coconut Whipped Cream  Perfect coconut whipped cream is at your fingertips with this step-by-step tutorial! Plus, we’ve recently updated the post with new information on what brands are best and which brands to avoid!  What is coconut whipped cream? Coconut whipped cream is a dairy-free alternative to classic whipped cream, which is made with heavy whipping cream! For a dairy-free, vegan-friendly version, simply swap a good quality full fat coconut milk or coconut cream in its place and whip into soft peaks! How is coconut whipped cream made? Coconut whipped cream is made by:  Selecting a good quality brand of coconut milk or cream (see recommendations below) Chilling can overnight in the refrigerator to harden (chilling in the freezer doesn’t work as well) Scooping hardened coconut cream into a mixing bowl and leaving any clear liquid behind (reserve for smoothies, etc.) Whipping with a hand mixer or stand mixer until light peaks form Optionally sweetening with sifted powdered sugar or stevia to taste (liquid sweeteners can weigh it down   Best brands for coconut whipped cream? We tested 9 brands and these are the results! Listed from best to worst:  Savoy Coconut Cream – 10/10 – firm on top, liquid on bottom, super fluffy / creamy when scooped out – guar free! Nature’s Charm Coco Whipping Cream – 10/10 whipped nicely, used the whole can, subtly sweetened, so delicious. Aroy-D – 10/10 – amazingly fluffy when scooped out – little liquid on the bottom. Whips like a dream – guar free! 365 Whole Foods Organic Coconut Milk – 9/10 – firm to scoop out, half liquid, not too grainy – blended perfectly, especially after adding some of the coconut water to the bowl. Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk Classic – 8/10 – firm to scoop out, ⅓ liquid – whips up nicely, especially with the addition of a little coconut water from the can. Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk Simple (guar free) – 6-10 – scooped a little grainy, but fluffy out of the can. ½ liquid. Whipped easily, with a few more chunks and slightly less creaminess than the “classic” counterpart Field day Classic Unsweetened Coconut Milk- 7/10 – watery on top, hard at bottom, but creamy to scoop. Whipped well, a little less fluffy / creamy than the others. Trader Joe’s Organic Coconut Cream – 5/10 – grainy / oily at first – grainy and didn’t whip well but wasn’t runny Trader Joe’s Organic Coconut Milk – 3/10 – chunky and hard – half liquid – blended into bits but too firm to whip.   Tips for perfect coconut whipped cream  Select a good quality brand of coconut milk (see recommendations above). Chill overnight, not in the freezer for best results. Chilling overnight is key or the coconut cream won’t harden and will likely be too soft to whip. Before whipping, chill a large mixing bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes! If your coconut whipped cream is too stiff when whipping, add some of the reserved liquid from the can to help it blend smoother and create more air! See clumps? Keep whipping and scraping down sides, and add some of the reserved liquid from the can to soften the mixture and create more air! Use immediately, OR (our preferred) make ahead and chill for 4 hours + where it will firm up even more! Keep it sugar free by adding a little stevia to taste!   NOTE: Post updated 3/21/19 with brand recommendations, tips for perfect coconut whipped cream every time, and more photos. ",https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Pumpkin Bread (V + GF)  This bread has been a long time in the making. I posted about it weeks ago on Instagram and have since tested it a few more times to perfect it. The first attempt yielded moist, flavorful bread that was a bit too crumbly. The second attempt seemed hopeful, but it failed to remedy that problem once again. Third time was a charm! I think I’ve nailed it. So excited to share this simple 1-Bowl Vegan AND Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread with you guys! It starts with the vegan miracle – flax eggs. And then an additional natural binder: mashed banana. I’ve found that banana binds otherwise crumbly baked goods when they’re both vegan and gluten-free. Even though it’s the tiniest bit detectable in the overall flavor, the texture is spot on and the pumpkin and pie spices really shine through. When you bake this up, two things happen: 1) Your house will smelllike pumpkin heaven. 2) Dancing will ensuewhen you peer inside the oven and seehow beautifully it rises and turns deep golden orange in color. Huzzah! But you must, and I repeat, must, resist the urge to slice in right away. Let it cool completely before slicing or it can be a tad on the crumbly side. Now the important part. What’s it taste like? AMAZING. It’s Tender Moist Pumpkin-y Perfectly sweet Subtly spiced Studded with pumpkin seeds Light Satisfying &amp; Shareable Intestingthis recipe several times, I’ve eaten more pumpkin bread than any human should in one month. But, surprisingly, it was all so deliciousit didn’t wear on me one bit and I even struggledto give the last loaf away to friends. That’s how good this bread is!  This is the perfect bread to make for fall parties, Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving, pumpkin carving, or just to have on hand for a snack on chilly days.

0,Sweet Potato Pie Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Pie Oats  My family is more of the pumpkin pie kin. Sweet potatoes areleft for marshmallow-topped casseroles. No shame there. Recently, I’ve been craving them all the time. For instance, ingranolaorburied undera mound of chickpeas, Mediterranean style. But I’ve yet to thrust theminto the breakfast scene. And if there’s one nutrient-packed root veg that deserves the morning spotlight, it’s this guy.  Sweet potatoes are apowerhouse when it comes to nutrition. They’re rich in beta carotene and vitamins A and C, and they act as an anti-inflammatory in the body. One large potatoprovides4 grams protein, 6 grams of fiber, and just 162 calories. So, indulge away my friends. Indulge away.   These oats require just 7 ingredients and about 30 minutes start to finish. And, if you bake (or microwave) your sweet potatoes ahead of time (like me!), it’ll go even faster and you’ll always have someon hand to add to your morning oats or a quicksoup. Though I made this version with rolled oats, I includednotes for using steel cut oats as well. You can also find my other steel-cut oat recipe hereserved with brown sugar pears, as well as my favorite Creamy Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries. So many oats, so little time.

0,Simple Vegetarian Meatballs | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Meatballs  When I was in college I lived in a shady apartment complex in Wichita. Thelaundry room was in a separate building, which meant I had to lugmy clothes back andforth in the rain or shine to ensure I didn’t run out of presentable clothing for work and school. Society, why do you impose such harsh rules on us? Well, that lasted about a month. Before long I was trucking it back to my dad’s house just 20 minutes away where he’d often cook me dinner while I was folding my socks. (Just kidding. Who folds their socks? Ugh, Rhonda. You would.)    If your dad is anything like mine, he’s all about simple, hearty meals. Spaghettiwas one of his specialties. A little pasta, a lotta sauce, and a considerable amount of meatiness. In fact, one evening (whilst doing laundry), I had two platefuls then promptly passed out on his couch from sheer exhaustion. My father proceeded to fold all of my clothes for me and wake me up with a kiss on the forehead reminding me it was time to go home. Aren’t dads the best? Mine is.  I still love spaghetti and crave it almost weekly. And thegood news is, meatless meatballs can taste just asdelicious and areevenhealthier than their meaty counterparts. Who knew?  These meatballs are based with tempeh, which is made from fermented soy beans. I know, sounds suspicious. But thinkof nutritious soy beans processed in a way that makes it like tofu, but less processed. (More info here.) This not only means it’s firmer to work with, but also more nutritionally dense! One 4 ounce serving contains ~20grams of protein. WHAT? Now that’s a meatball.  Plus, this recipe is simple with just 10 ingredients and roughly ~45 minutes total prep and cook time. That’s manageable, right? Even for the busy cook.  And the important part: What do they taste like? They’re Warm Savory Tender on the inside Firm with a crust on the outside Italian herb-infused Fresh Simple Satisfying &amp; PERFECT with marinara and pasta This recipewould be the perfect special weeknight meal. Though it takes a little more time to prepare, it’s still simple in nature and yields an incredibly satisfying meal that’s wonderfully healthy and nutritionally dense. What more could you ask for?  While I can’t offer you laundry service while you enjoy this meal (thanks, dad), I can say it’s worth the effort and is sure to satisfy the whole family. We hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did! If you give it a try, be sure to let us know! Leave a comment, Pin it, or take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram.

0,Vegan Mexican Layer Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan 7-Layer Mexican Dip  I’m not a big sports person, butthe onset of fall gets me in the mood for game day-style snacking.

We prefer Netflix over football any day.  After discovering aVegan Mexican Cheese that requires no soaking or cooking, I knew I had to do something special with it. This dip immediately came to mind. Seven layer dipsalways made an appearance at any sporting event I’ve ever been to, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be made on a random Wednesday when you’re having friends over.

It’s: Creamy Flavorful Savory Fresh Filling Slightly spicy &amp; So dang delicious and flavorful Wave after wave of flavor it gets better with each bite. I found myself going back for seconds, then thirds, then (What? Who said that?).  Make this dip for neighbors, friends, family or just yourself, whether it’s game day or not. You will love the creamy texture, serious cheesiness, fluffy guac and perfect crunch from theveggies. Chips required, obviously. If you do try it, let us know!

0,Pumpkin-Spiced Apple Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin-Spiced Apple Pie  One thing I have yet to do in life is visit an apple orchard. I know. I feel as though my childhood was somehow robbed of this experience and I’m set on redeeming it. Perhaps this month! But in the meantime, a friend of mine whose family grows their own graciously gifted me a giant bag of organic apples, so this will have to do for now. Aren’t they beautiful? I immediately knewwhat I wanted to do with them – make John’s all time favorite dessert: Apple pie! But with a twist.  To give the crust and filling a touch of pumpkin flavor, I added both pumpkin butter and pumpkin pie spice. The result was an 8-ingredient apple pie with subtlepumpkin flavor and theperfect amount of sweetness and warmth. Mmm, this one is a winner, and a lovelypie to kick off fall baking.  For the crust – which is kept vegan with vegan butter –I attempted a lattice top! It was my first time trying my hand at this method and it certainly wasn’t the most beautiful thing to look at, but at least I tried! You could also do a traditional top crust, or even a crumble! The filling is where it’s really at anyway.  This pie is a fall dream. It’s: Warm Sweet Perfectly spiced Loaded with apples Pumpkin-infused Perfect with coconut whip (or dairy-free ice cream) &amp; Seriously simple If you’ve never made a pie before, this would be a greatone for first timers! The apple filling is a no-brainer – just peel, cut, and toss with sugar + spices – and the crust is very basic. Despite minimal effort, the result is superimpressive.

0,Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes  Friends, it’s been a while. How have you been? Do you love this time of year? I do. What haveyou been eating these days? Salads? Chocolate? Are you getting outside in this lovely, briskweather? Are you feeling well?I’d love to know. Fallmakes me all emotional and introspective. I once cried for an hour after a scenic drive whenthe leaves were turning. We werelistening to Greg Laswell. I got all grateful and started weeping.Fingers crossed it’san annualoccurrence.Sometimes you just need a good cry. Lately I’ve been eating lots of plants and less sugar. And I’ve been walking and running a lot. And books! I’ve finished a lot of books recently, which isn’t typical for me,this one being my favorite. I’ve also been listening to a lot of podcasts. Podcasts always impact me. Especially this one onsustainability, this one on hospitality,and this one onminimalism. Good stuff.  Speaking of good stuff, how about them sweet potatoes? For me, one of the most difficultparts of eating a plant-based diet is getting creative with meal ideas. Left to my own devices, I’d eat chips and guac for every meal. Clearly, that isn’t healthy or sustainable. So, recently I’ve been trying to branch out and experiment withmore well-balanced meals, such as these Mediterranean Sweet Potatoes.   The concept is simple: Baked sweet potatoes – cut in half to shorten cookingtime Seasoned, roasted chickpeas Garlic-herb sauce Parsley-tomato salad for garnish The result is a 30-minute lunch or dinner that’s both satisfying, savory and sweet, and seriously healthy.  This is my new favorite way to do Mediterranean. This dish is: Savory Sweet Fresh Smoky Warm Comforting Seriously healthy Filling Customizable &amp; Simple I love how the sweetness of the sweet potatoes blends perfectly the chickpeas and garlic sauce, and the lemony parsley-tomato salad provides a zesty fresh finish. Friends, I’m in love.  If you try this dish – and you must – let us know! Leave a comment or take a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram or @minimalistbaker on Twitter! Or, share it with friends on Pinterest. We’re convinced people need this in their lives. As always, thanks for supporting what we do. Cheers!

0,Simple Tofu Chilaquiles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Tofu Chilaquiles  A couple of years ago, I didn’t even know chilaquiles existed – I know. But that all changed when somefriends of ours made us some for dinner one evening and the flavor and simplicity of the dish blew me away. I’ve been itching to veganize it ever since.  The base for this dishis a hearty5-ingredient sauce, which comes together fastand is not only flavorful, but also incredibly versatile. While it’s perfect in this dish, I also suspect itwould be amazing on enchiladas, tofu scrambles, and more. I can’t wait to experiment with other uses.  Traditional chilaquiles recipes typically involve chips or fried tortilla strips, stir fried in a rich tomato sauce and topped with chicken, eggs and cheese. But this version remains vegan friendly yetstill amazingly flavorful. Plus, it’s considerably healthier thanks to DIY baked tortilla chips.  This dish only takes 30 minutes to prepare, and issuper satisfying with 16 grams of protein per serving. I love it for breakfast, but it would also make the perfectbrunch or even weeknight dinner. John and I attempted to split this skillet for lunch and couldn’t even finish it all! It was so filling and fresh and most importantly, husband-approved.  What does it taste like? I’m glad you asked. It’s: Savory Spicy Saucy Slightly crispy Rich Comforting Healthy Satisfying &amp; Fast Top this dish with some fresh cilantro, onion andVegan Mexican “Parmesan” Cheese for another wave of freshness andflavor. In my opinion, this step is a must.  I think you guys are going to LOVE this dish.

0,Vegan Mexican Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mexican Cheese (Three Ways)  The thing about cheese is, I love it. However, my body is like “ah, nah.” The thing about this Cashew-less Vegan Queso is, it’s delicious. But my watch is like “ah, nah.” The thing about this recipe is, it takes 10 minutes and tastes like the real deal. Ah, yeah.  I absolutely adore eggplantand cashewcheeses, but the time commitment is a little too much for everyday use. So one dayI started to wonderif you could make Vegan Mexican “Parmesan.” Answer? Yes. Then, I wondered if you could add that back to the processor and make cheesy cashew butter spread. Answer? Yes. Finally, I wondered if you could add hot water to that spread and make 10-minute pourable queso with no soaking or roasting involved. Answer? DOUBLE YES. Friends, this is a major win in my book. The first way: Shakeable! Add raw cashews, nutritional yeast, salt, cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to a food processor and blitz away. Ta-da! You have shakeable Vegan Mexican Cheese, perfect for salads, tofu scrambles, tacos, and more. Now that’s some adobo, bro. Add the same ingredients as the shakeablecheese to the food processor with a little olive oil and you have a sexylooking spread. A chipotle pepper in adobo sauce takes it to the next level with a smoky, spicy wave of flavor. This version is perfect as a dip, sandwich spread, or base layer in burritos. But we’re not done yet.  Add some hot water to the spreadable cheese and we’ve got queso! This version is perfect for virtually any Mexican dish, especially nachos, burritos, taco salads, and dips. Sit tight because I’ve got a recipe coming next week using this version that makes theeperfect healthy vegan snack for parties, game days and lazy afternoon lounging. Can’t wait!

Can we move onto baking now?   So I have this super secret but not-so-secret plan to create a new granola recipe every time I run out of my last batch. Is that OK with you guys? Idon’t like making the same thing twice anymore. Must be a side effectof food blogging. I’m totally fine with it though. It thrusts me out into the world and forces me to try new things. Like this granola, for instance. It has pumpkin and maple and pecans, oh my! How can you go wrong (no seriously)? This recipe is simple in that it requires just 30 minutes and 9 ingredients, most of which you’ll have on hand as autumn sets in (squeal). Pumpkin? Check. Maple syrup? Check. Pecans and pepitas? Check and check. Don’t you just love this time of year?   The all important question: What does it taste like? Happiness on a spoon. It’s: Crunchy Pumpkin-y Nutty Not too sweet Perfectly spiced Healthy Satisfying Customizable &amp; Shareable Because it’s loaded with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, this granola makes the perfect breakfast or snack. I love mine with a little almond milk. That’s really all it needs. Bonus: Itwould also make a lovely gift for fall birthdays and other special occasions.

0,Chocolate Peanut Butter Avocado Pudding | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Peanut Butter Avocado Pudding  I don’t whattook me so long to share my takeon avocado pudding, but it was long overdue! This stuff is amazing. If you’ve never tried it, now is your chance.  I rarely eat chocolate without peanut butter. The two just go hand in hand. So it was a no brainer to add a healthy spoonfulinto this creamy, rich, nutritionally-dense pudding.  Nutritionally dense, you say? Yes!  Avocados are rich inhealthy fats, folate, carotenoids and are extremely heart healthy. Bananas provide Vitamin B6, potassium, fiber and natural sweetness. Chocolate provides antioxidants and magnesium. And peanut butter adds protein and even more healthy fats.  That’s one healthy bowl of pudding, yo.  The great thing about this pudding – besides its immensely rich texture and chocolate flavor – is that it’s naturally sweetened with dates. Of course, you can substitutewhatever other natural sweetener you prefer– maple syrup and agave being ideal. It’s also customizable. If you prefer an intense chocolate flavor, add less sweetener. And if you’re like me, you likeyour pudding on the sweeter side and will prefer adding more. It’s extremely forgiving and flexible in this way. And did I mention rich?  In my opinion, the coconut whipped cream and additional peanut butter on top are essential. It adds another level of decadence and wave of flavor that just brings it all together. Please follow my example.  You guys are going to LOVE this pudding. It’s: Rich Creamy Chocolaty Peanut buttery Not too sweet Thick Fudgy Nutritionally dense Customizable &amp; A heart-healthy snack or dessert If you give this recipe a try, you simply musttake a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram so we can see!

Plus, it’s loaded with nutrient-rich foods like raw walnuts, black beans, quinoa, and raw beets.  These burgersare loosely inspired by the beet-quinoa burgers served seasonally at LT Burger in Sag Harbor, New York. Of course, I haven’t tried them myself, but the reader who emailed just raved about it. And if her daughter who thinks most veggie burgers are “weird” loved this one, there must be something special about it. After scanning their menu I seriously wanted to visit the area just to sample LT’smenu. But for now, recreating their recipes from afar will have to do.  I was quite pleased with how these little guys turned out. They’re Hearty Smoky Flavorful Tender and moist on the inside Perfectly crisp on the outside Not at all mushy Simple Savory &amp; Perfect for satisfying killer burger cravings Another thing I love about them is thatthe raw beets give them a deep magenta hue that makes them irresistibly beautiful.

Every time I drink it I wish I hada giant maple long john in hand, just like my former 8-year old self would’ve done. Those were the days.   Thankfully, even though this coconut water tastes like purechocolate milk, it’s dairy free and makes the perfect base for a post workout recovery shake with antioxidant-rich cocoa powder, electrolyte-containing coconut water, and a hint of coconut cream for that rich, creamy texture every smoothieneeds.

Quantity eaters rarely take one bite of a dessert and say, “Oh my, that’s too rich for me to finish. I’ll pass. ” But rather, “Oh, man, that’s so good I need two spoons to eat it faster.” And if this describes you, banana splits are likely your kind of dessert. So many layers of flavor, and more importantly, somuch volume.  You guys know I couldn’t createNo-Churn Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream and do nothing with it. That would be borderline sin.

0,No-Churn Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Churn Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream  Up until last year, I didn’t own an ice cream maker. (And the only reason I have onenow is that I won one in a giveaway.) But, I would always envy people who had one.“Ugh, those people with their ice cream makers. So fancy and cool, making their ice cream all the time. Ugh.” In their defense, it’s totally worth it. Since winning mine I’vebeen putting it toextensive use: exhibitsA, B, C, D, and E. But, fear not. Ihear the cries of the people, of youwho are weary of one more appliance; the cost, the space, the time it takes to pull it out of that dustycornercabinet, etc. And I answer with this: Let not your lack of ice cream maker stand in the way of enjoying delicious, creamy, full-fat ice cream at home. Behold: No Churn Chocolate Ice Cream with all the richness, flavor and creaminess of the real thing, no ice cream maker required.   Here’s the deal. If you make coconut whipped cream and sweeten it with dates, good things happen. Such good things, in fact, that it makes the perfect base for creamy, dreamy ice cream, no churning required. The magic happens withthe full-fat coconut cream, the vigorous whipping, and the mysterious date and its amazingabilityto resist freezing (a fact I discovered when making 5-Ingredient Caramel Peanut Butter Truffles). The result is an amazingly versatile ice cream base with tons of air incorporated sans churning. Throw in some cocoa powder and BAM: a fluffy chocolate mousse-like base that freezes up beautifully.   What’s more? This recipe requires just 5 ingredients: Coconut Milk or Cream Cocoa Powder Almond Milk Dates Vanilla That’s it! And prep time is only30 minutes. Thedifficult part is the waiting for it to freeze. And if you’re impatient like me you poke your finger in the freezer every 15 minutes to see if it’s ready. Patience, young one. It’s worth the wait.   This ice cream is kind of amazing! It’s: Creamy Rich Chocolatey Fluffy Perfectly Sweet Scoopable Refined sugar free Natural &amp; Seriously simple Plus, it’s extremely customizable! Though I’ve yet to try other flavors, I can only assume that the base would work well with peanut butter, strawberries, and perhapseven dairy-free yogurt! Oh man, the possibilities are endless.

0,Almond Joy Granola | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Joy Granola  “Super coconutty! That’s what I should say. It’s SUPER coconutty.” Literally the thought I had while eating a bowl of this granola and penning this post. Whoever said I couldn’t multitask was a bigliar.   This granola was inspired by two things: 1) a reader suggestion! And 2) this Almond Joy Butter. Truth be told, I wasn’t a hugealmond joy fan growing up. Snickers was where it was at, and later on, Caramelos and Milky Ways also floated my boat. I’m kind of a candy bar fan in general, if you couldn’t tell.  I didn’t really like coconut anything until giving coconut butter a try. And then onceI ventured into coconut milk territory, it was all over. The rest ishistory. Now it’s an all-out love affair. This granola is infused with coconut two ways: Coconut flake and coconut oil. The combination of the two give it the perfect coconut flavor and texture without being too overwhelming. The crispy oats and almonds lend extra texture and nutrition, and little specks of dark chocolate sweeten things up. If you’re like me, add more chocolatethan I list or you’ll just end up digging it all out of the jar because there’s inevitably never enough. #truestory   This recipe is not only grade-A delicious, it’s also simple.

The ingredients are basic as well. If you’re like me, you always have vegan butter and sprinkles on hand anyway. If not, you’ll probably start doing so after trying these babes.   Quintessential funfetticupcakes have sprinkles inside the cupcake as well ason top of the frosting. If I could’ve figured outanother way to infuse sprinkles into these babes, I surely would’ve.

I like that we spend everynew year’s evetalking aboutthe people we are and the people we want to become.

0,Baked Rosemary Beet Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Rosemary Beet Chips  I distinctly remember one December in college when my dad took me to his office Christmas party at a dinnertheatre. I hardly remember the show, but I do remember the buffet which seemed to extend into eternity with overcooked vegetables. Among the saddestvictims were Brussels sprouts and beets. What is it about these beautiful, delicious veggies that makes people use and abuse them? They are delicious. They are rich with nutrients. They deserve another chance.Friends, wemust raise awareness. (Dramatic, I know. But in the name of veggies I go to great lengths.)  I love roasting beets (I share my favorite way to eatthem in our downloadablecookbook). But for a quicker version that makesfor a crispy, salty snack, these chips are where it’s at.  These beet chips are about as simple as it gets: 30 minutes, 4 ingredients, 1 pan. The only other tool you’ll need is a sharp knife or a mandolin for slicing. At the recommendation of my pal Kate, I recently invested in this mandolin. I’m usually incredibly hesitant to invest in equipment we don’t needin order to keep a clutter free kitchen. But when I recognize I’m missing atool that couldhelpcomplete tasks in the kitchenmore efficiently, I’m all for it. If you like making veggie chips, veggie pastaand fries, this could be the slim-profile, affordable toolfor you.  Another perk of these chips?Beets are extremely healthy for you! Read all about the benefits over on our Fudgy Beet Cupcakes post (and make the cupcakes while you’re at it). Flavor wise, these chipslack that “dirty” earthy taste some people despise about beets (i.e. my husband). Andthesimple addition of rosemary adds an earthy aroma I adore. Healthy? Flavorful? Fast? Count me in.  You guys are going to love these chips! They’re Healthy Crispy Simple Savory Infused with rosemary &amp; Perfect for snacking I nearly gobbled these up in one sitting – couldn’t resist! Even if you aren’t a huge beet fan, give these a try. I thinkyou’dbe surprised how neutral in flavor, yet delightfully crispy they are. Enjoy!

0,Crispy Baked French Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Garlic Matchstick Fries  French fries. We have an on-again off-again relationship. Meaning I stuff my face withthem once a month then swear off them until we meet again next month. Thankfully, however, I’ve recently mastered the art of making fries at home super crispy style sans frying. Score! Now the two of uscan see each other much moreoften –thank goodness.  I’ve made french friesbefore that required soaking in warm water before baking. Too much time and effort I say! These guys go straight into the oven at a high temp for ultimate crispiness. It’s the matchstick shape and high temperature that helps them cook fasterand get that golden brown crisp. I’m all for a good wedge-cut fry, but for that ultimate crispy texture, matchstick is where it’s at.  For another wave of flavor I sauteed some minced garlic in olive oil to toss withthe fries fresh out of the oven. This is an optional step but certainly one that adds more zest and depth of flavor.   All that’s left is to dip in some Whiskey BBQ Ketchup and go to town. Oh mama.  I’m OBSESSED with these fries. They’re Crispy Salty Tender on the inside Garlicky Perfect with ketchup &amp; Slightly addictive Serve these guyswith burgers, sandwiches, queso, or on their own! They make perfect party appetizers and are sure to impress yourgrowingthrong of friends.

0,Whiskey BBQ Ketchup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whiskey BBQ Ketchup  It takes a lot for John and me to fall hardcore in love with a new restaurant, but the minute Idipped one french fry into the whiskey bbq ketchup at Beer Kitchen in Kansas City, it was all over. It had to be made at home.  I’m already a condiment and sauce lover, so if there’s legithouse-made ketchup somewhere chances are I’ve tried it. Oddly enough though, I’ve never made my own! That had to change. Since my love for the whiskey BBQ ketchup has become borderline obsession, I decided to try my hand at it. Although it’s not a total 1:1 match, I got dangclose! It has allthe rich flavor of ketchup with a hint of smoky BBQand a boozy undertone. Mmmmm, delicious.   This ketchup is about as simple as it gets: 30 minutes  10 ingredients  1 pot And somehow it still delivers allthe bold flavor of BBQ in a saucy, richketchup. Friends, ready your french fries.

0,Vegan Corn Chowder Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Summer Corn Soup  Corn has always been one of my favorite summer foods. I recallonce eating four cobs in one sitting at afamily cookout,much to my parents’ amazement. It’s just that good.  When the warmer months roll around, I’m all about corn:cornbread muffins, cornbread waffles,corn salsa, corn everything. In our cookbook, I evenshare my go-to cornbread and cornbread crouton recipes.So good with/on everything. So, I figured it was primetime to add some corn soup to my repertoire, especially since it lends itself to well to creamy, brothy goodness. Enter, this summer corn soup.  The recipeissimple: 9 ingredientstotal, and likely things you have on hand right now. And not only is it both vegan and gluten free, but it can also be prepared one of two ways: Blended and smooth, or chunky and brothy. I blended mine, but it would also be delicious left as is. I just happen to be all about the creamy vegan things. Can you really blame me?   This soup is the perfect light summer meal. It’s Warm Healthy Satisfying Savory with a subtle sweetness Loaded with summer produce Quick &amp; easy &amp; Creamy or Brothy – whichever you prefer I highly recommend making this soup as a last summer hurrah before fall arrives.

0,Chocolate Cherry Almond Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Cherry Almond Milk  Supa thick. Supa chocolaty. Supa cherry-y? Let’s do this.  If you’ve ever wanted more out of your almond milk, this recipeis for you. I am kind of a chocolate milk fanatic and have made my own from scratchbefore. But, as Anna(my favorite beauty blogger)would say, “I can’t be bothered” with making it from scratch every day. Therefore, Almond Breeze+selected mix-ins = DIY flavored almond milk in minutes This version was inspired by the genius that isArtful Desperado. Have you seen what Gabriel is cooking up these days? Just go – go now. After seeing his Black ForestPopsicles, I had to get in on that action. Because I’m more of a beverage than popsicle girl, almond milk was the perfection solution. Lucky for me (and you), there’s no waiting involved here. Just a creamy, delicious chocolate-cherry beverage in your hands in minutes.  Other perks? It’s Vegan Gluten-free Naturally sweetened &amp; Deceptively healthy For aesthetic effect, I blended them separately for more of a chocolate-cherry swirl. But for the lazy ones among us, you can just throw it allin together for the perfect blend.  This milk is the jam. It’s Refreshing Chocolaty Cold Creamy Cherry-infused Rich Healthy Uncomplicated Fast &amp; Customizable Guess what? If you freeze your cherries this would make a bomb smoothie.

0,Vegan PB&J Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake PB&amp;J Pie  My earliest memory of eating a PB&amp;J is when I was about 5 years old. My family lived in New Mexico and my mom would take me to half-day Kindergarten in the morning, pick me up around noon and promptly make me a diagonal-cut PB&amp;J once we got home. I would eat my sandwich hovering over a towel “place mat” on the floor in front of the television, eyes gluedon “Woody the Woodpecker,” slurping downmilkbetween oversized bites. Life was good back then. Mom planned everything, fed me when I was hungry, made my bed. Activities includedcartoons, Nintendo and riding bikes. But life wasn’t “rich” then like it is now, filled with so many amazing peopleandexperiences, which is why I’m OK accepting adulthood with open arms. Maybe eating a PB&amp;J today as an “adult”is some silly attempt to hang onto the simplicity of mychildhood – a time when life seemedeasy andNintendo wasking. I think life can still be simple now, we just have to be intentional about it. And it doesn’t hurt to eat a PB&amp;J (pie) once in a while just to keep things in perspective; to stay humble. Somehow the combination of peanut butter and jelly does that for me. It takesme right back to 5-year-old Dana, even if just for a lunch hour.  When setting out to make this recipe, I actually wanted to make a “PB&amp;J Dip,” which you could still totally do if you wanted to go crustless. But the minute I saw the way coconut whipped cream reacted to date “caramel,” I knew a pie was in order.   You guys? This filling? It’s amazing. Coconut whipped cream is already delicious on its own. But when you (naturally) sweeten it with date paste and throw in some peanut butter, things get CRAY. It becomes the thickest, fluffiest most ridiculous pie filling you ever laid eyes on. Don’t you worry. I have other ideas for this combo up my sleeve. And I LOVE that it’s entirely refined sugar-, dairy- and gluten-free! Amazing stuff going on over here.   So the pie. Assembly goes as following: 1. Bake 2-ingredient crust (the only baking involved) 2. Make strawberry compote and cool. 3. Whip coconut cream. 4. Add peanut butter and date paste. 5. Whip once more. 6. Add pie filling to crust and top with cooled compote. 7. Chill. Eat. Start living your life. Capiche? Capiche. Let the party begin.    This pie is ridiculous. Hands down one of my favorite recipes to date. It’s Fluffy Thick Peanut buttery Perfectly sweet Jammy Fruity Surprisingly light Naturally sweetened Loaded with flavor Sealed with a graham cracker crust Satisfying Shareable Portable &amp; EASY Is there anything NOT to love about this pie? I think not. Plus, it can beeven further simplified by omitting the crust andmaking itadip instead. Serving bowl, fluffy peanut butter layer, strawberry jam, served with graham crackers, cookies and fruit. Hello, dip geniewho suddenly has 15 friends lined up at your door for seconds. More like hello poopularity. Yes, ‘poopularity.’    You guys MUST make this pie. You will flip over how good it is. And if you do, share it with the world by tagging #minimalistbaker on Instagram.

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Gluten-Free Waffles  If you’re anything like me you end up having the same thing for breakfast most days without realizing you haven’t branched out in months. Lame. Not that eating the same thing every day isnecessarily a bad thing. But it seems the moresimple options I have on hand, the more likely I am to branch out. Enter: these waffles.  30 minutes, 7 ingredients, and totally customizable. Cinnamon apple? Add cinnamon and bakedapples. Strawberry chocolate? Add strawberries and chocolate chips. Banana peanut butter? Add banana slices and a little peanut butter. This simple base really is the perfect everyday waffle that you can then dress up as you please. You know, for branching out purposes (wink).   For the gluten free flour blend, I use my go to blend which you’l find in the notes. I find it to provide the perfect amount of crispinesswithout any grittiness. Maple syrup or agave nectar (or raw honey if not vegan) acts as a natural sweetener, while GFoats add a touch more fiber and texture.  You’re going to love these waffles. They’re Perfectly crisp Tender on the inside Not too sweet Wholesome Hearty Customizable Simple Satisfying &amp; Perfect for everyday breakfast or weekend brunch For small households these waffles are excellent frozen and toasted up as needed.

0,Peanut Butter Oreo S'mores | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter S’moreos  OK, can you just indulge me for a moment? I know what this looks like: Unadulterated, full on fat kid food. That’s because it is. But if there’s one thing I’velearned about life thus far it’s that time flies and life really is short and you’ve got to take advantage of moments and experiences whenyou can. Otherwise they’re gone in a snap and you wake up one day and realize you never did any of the things you said you wanted to do (whoa, that escalated quickly.) But seriously. You know how it goes. You say you’re going to swim all summer long because winter was dreadful, but you only make it to the pool once. Or you beat yourself up for having one too many chocolates at that party last night, but in reality you didn’tgain a single ounceand all that energy was wasted on stress and guilt when it could’ve been used to enjoy your company andthat last delectable bite. Have I plead my case? Are you convinced to live in the moment and enjoy the little things? I hope so. And I also hope that one of those “little things” is one of these s’more(o)s. Because dang girl, you deserve it.   The best thing about these S’moreos* is that they can be made inside or out so you don’t need a campfire or fire pit! You onlyneed an oven with a broiler and you’re good to go. What else is simple about them? 3ingredients, 5 minutes and 1 pan required. Does it get any better? I think not.  The assembly is super simple, too. Just top half of your Oreos with a marshmallow, toast until golden brown, drizzle with salty peanut butter and smooshdown with your other Oreo. Voila! It’s as easy as that.      Boom, it’s magic. These S’moreos are LEGIT. You’re going to love them! They’re Warm Gooey Seriously decadent Chocolaty Peanut buttery Salty-sweet Oozing with toasted marshmallow goodness Customizable (add a peanut butter cup or strawberry jam instead of PB!) Shareable &amp; Perfect any time of year Here’s what I suggest: Invite over some friends, challenge everyoneto revisit their summer bucket list and knock off at least one more item beforewe up and slip into fall. Life is short! Oreos deserve to be upgraded with peanut butter and marshmallow. Just do it.  And if you do, be sure to take a picture of your gathering ORyour solo-lady S’moreo party and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to seeyou in action living it up this summer. Cheers!

Creamy, velvety, savory, andsubtlysweet, it makes the perfect flavor companion to vegan parmesan and fresh herbs in this 10-ingredient veganand gluten-freepasta.  The magic starts with sautéed shallot and garlic to give the sauce a robust and subtly sweet base. In the meantime, roast up some red peppers until soft, charred and delicious. This will give your sauce that gorgeous orange hue and creamy texture.  To keep this pasta gluten free I went with a gluten free spaghetti noodle and used cornstarch as my thickener instead of a traditional flour roux. The result was a creamy,thicksauce just begging to be tossed with perfectly al dente noodles.  The sauce gets its flavor from foursources: 1. Sautéed garlic &amp;shallot 2. Roasted red pepper 3.

0,Vegan Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecakes  Today, I turn 28. Of the many things I’ve learned I realize the bulk of those lessonshave come in the last couple of years. I’ve learned to trust my instincts and be OK with the unconventional. I’ve learned the importance ofdoing what I love even if it feels silly. I’ve grown to love food photography even more than I did when we first started this blog. I’ve learned that running a food blog with your spousecan not only be fun but also ridiculouslyfulfilling. I’velearned I still love cake and pancakes and simplicityand saying “hubba, hubba,”and probably always will. Enough about me. This space is about you guys, really. I love to cook and take photos of the things I make and then share them with you all. That is what makes me supremely happy – the best birthday gift ever. To celebrate all of these wonderful things, I made youcheesecakes. Peanut Butter Cup 9-ingredient vegan cheesecakes that screamsimplicity: No springform pans, no water baths, no baking (besides the 5-minute crust). Just pure chocolate-peanut butter goodness that even the amateur cook can master. If you have the ability to blend and pour, you can makethese little bites of heaven. All you need is 30 minutes and a muffin tin and you’re golden.  Yes, oreo cookies are vegan! I think it was the universe’s way of saying “vegans can have fun, too.” This crust is the only part of the recipe that requires baking (5 minutes) and it’s optional. I just prefer a bitmore firm crust. But if you’re OK with more crumbly, leave the oven off for today.   The filling? Simple. Soaked cashews Saltedpeanut butter Lemon Maple syrup Coconut milk (or another non-dairy milk) Coconut oil The 2-ingredient chocolate ganache? That’s optional (but oh so recommended).

0,Healthy Carrot Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Carrot Apple Muffins (Vegan + GF)  We recently took a tripto Portland, Oregon where I visited several of our favorite bakeries and coffee shops. Perhaps my favorite is Crema–home of the biggest, fluffiest, most perfectly sweet zucchini muffin I’ve ever had. Since I’ve already mastered the art of the Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake (&lt;- OMG have you tried it yet?), I wanted to venture into the land of carrot cake. This recipe would certainly work as a cake, but I wanted to go the healthier route that didn’t require frosting. Muffin tin, loaf pan, cake pan: Whatever route you choosethis 1-bowl, vegan, gluten-free recipe is going to blow you away! I literally couldn’t stop eating these(always a good sign).  The recipe starts with some of nature’s best sweeteners: Banana, apple and carrot. You can either use applesauce or grated sweet apple (a tip I got from a friend). I’ve tried both and they work well. Plus, it replaces some of the oil toprovide plenty of moisture.  Top these muffins with crushed walnuts for an extra kick of healthy fats, protein and Omega 3 fatty acids. In an ideal world I would eat a handful of walnuts every day; sometimes on top of a muffin, sometimes in granola, sometimesstraight from the jar. It doesn’t always happen but it’s a personal goal of mine. Can’t get enough of these nutrient-packed nuts.  Not only do these muffins require just one bowl, they’re also vegan and gluten free and surprisingly healthy! The only exception to the “healthy” label is the brown sugar (which I don’t mind in reasonable amounts). But if you’re looking to keep this recipemore natural, I’ve included muscovado (an unrefined brown sugar) as a substitution suggestion.  You’re going to love these wholesome, fruit- and veggie-packed muffins. They’re Tender and light Fluffy Golden brown Perfectly sweet Loaded with carrot and apple Wholesome Hearty Satisfying Healthy &amp; Simple Keep these muffins on hand for a quick, on-the-go breakfast or snack. I love packing these when we’re going on trips instead of having to buy super sugary and processed alternatives.

0,Tofu Vietnamese Spring Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vietnamese Spring Rolls with Crispy Tofu  This is my kind of soul food. The kind that’s fresh, filling, and loadedwith flavor. And that doesn’t make you feel like crap afterwards. Now that’s (healthy) livin’. I’ve made spring rolls before(&lt;- yes, we have a cookbook!) but never with such an abundance of flavorfulcomponents and herbs. Typically I leave my tofu raw, but not this time. I gave it a crispy edge by dredging it in cornstarch and sautéing it sesame oil. Then, I tossed it in my savory almond butter dipping sauce and gave it another flash “fry” in the pan. The result was a tender, slightly crispy, perfectly seasoned tofu that’s waybatter than raw without being too complicated.  Another new component is the dipping sauce. Typically, Vietnamese spring rolls come with a vinegar-based sauce, but, sorry no. I just can’t pass up the opportunity to whip upa creamy nut-based sauce. They’re just way more savory, satisfying and sexy. I love a good peanut sauce for spring rolls, but because peanuts can be a li’l hard to digest I went with almond butter as the base. Still so good and perfectly savory and sweet. What’s not to love?  These rolls are simple, fresh and filling. Inside you’ll find: Super thin rice noodles Mint Cilantro Red pepper Carrot Cucumber &amp; Crispy almond butter tofu And to take them from tasty to awesome, servethem with a fat serving of almond butter sauce.

0,Vegan Portobello Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Portobello Pizzas  Pizza. I could eat it e’eryday. But, then I would probably turn into a big pizza, which is not what I want out of life. Thankfully, there’s a solution. I can reserve My Favorite Vegan Pizza for weekends, The Best Ever Gluten-Free Pizza for Tuesdays, and this lovely mushroom pizza pie for Thursdays. You see? It’s not every day. It’s like every other day. That’s different, and therefore, totallyacceptable. #itsscience #rhondadontask  I really did want to make portobello pizzas because I have a thing for mushrooms and wanted to make pizza night a bit more wholesome and plant-based. Even though pizza with traditional crust is fine, especially when laden with lycopene-rich tomato sauce and loads of veggies and nutritional yeast, it’s still like eating bread. This was my (ultimate pizza) cheat. And guess what? While it’s not a 1:1 pizza swap, it’s a lovely change of pace.  So what does it taste like? Savory Tender with a bit of bite Pizza-esque Loaded withtomato sauce (the best part) Crunchy from the veg Perfectly “cheesy” from the vegan parmesan Fresh Wholesome Satisfying &amp; Not like you’re eating a loaf of bread. Win-win! If you make this pie, you should probably take a picture and tag it #minimalistbakeron Instagram. If you do, it would make me so happy. If you don’t, it would make me so sad. So, make me happy. OK? OK. Good talk. (Cheers!)  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-portobello-pizzas/
0,Super Seedy Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Seedy Granola Bars  Have you ever made granola bars that wereso good you couldn’t stop eating them? Yeah, these are those granola bars.  I have been loving making variations of our Healthy 5-ingredient Granola Bars. They’re so simple, quick and satisfying, I can’t help but dream up new flavors. Chocolate Chip Almond Butter? Yep. Healthy Brownie? Uh huh. Super Mega Seedy? Yeah, this is happening.  It starts with seeds, and lots of them! Seeds are an essential part of a plant-based diet. They’re like little nutritional powerhouses.  For instance, flax and chia seed are incredibly high in fiber and healthy fats, including Omega3s. Sunflower seeds are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and selenium – nutrients that protect virtually every square inch of our bodies. And hemp seeds – the healthiest of the bunch– are a complete protein, loaded with Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, and contain all 19 essential amino acids, which are essential foroptimum health.  What’s not to love about these bars? Oh, and I didn’t even talk about the oats and nuts! So many nutrients.  These bars get their sweetness from two sources: dates and agave nectar – two sweeteners found in nature that I love using in place of processed sugar whenever possible. The combination of the two not only provides an irresistibly sweet bite, but also acts as the glue that holds it all together.  My favorite part about making these? You get to use your hands and feel like a kid again. I love using my hands to mix the wet with the dry ingredients. Even though my hands are a sticky mess afterwards, it’s so worth it. Look at these beauties!  You’re going to love these bars. They’re: Oaty Nutty Hearty Crunchy in all the right places Perfectly salty-sweet Loaded with good-for-you ingredients MEGA seedy Satisfying &amp; Ridiculously delicious  These bars are perfect to make ahead of time for snacking when you’re shorton time. I like to keep a batch in my freezer in caseI have to run out the door andknow I’ll be hungry later. Please tell me I’m not the only childless person who packs snacks for outings? Please? If you make this recipe, be sure to let me know in the comments! Or, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. I want to know if it’s love at first bite (which, I suspect it will be).

0,Healthy Chocolate Chip Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chocolate Chip Blizzards To blizzard or not to blizzard, that is not the question. The question is: Which flavor blizzard to make? Last week I put out a little SOS vote on Instagramasking what flavor I should make: chocolate or banana cream pie. A tonof you banana lovers spoke up,but you couldn’t drown out the cries of the chocolate lovers. So, chocolate it was! But not to worry because I also made a banana version that’s comingsoon as well! Everybody wins.  First, chocolate. This recipe is simple to make and requires just 7 ingredients. It’s slightly adapted from my Vegan Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream, which was before my cashew-in-dairy-free-desserts discovery. Thus, I did a little ingredient switcheroo, added some mini chocolate chips and I had a blizzard on my hands!  The ingredients you’ll need are: Cashews Coconut milk Vanilla extract Cocoa or cacao powder Agave nectar Cane sugar &amp; Mini chocolate chips (or another mix-in of choice)  The result? Dreamy, creamy, chocolatey bliss. You’re going to love this blizzard! It’s Creamy Thick Mega chocolaty Perfectlysweet Spoonable Studded with chocolate chips Seriously satisfying &amp; Perfect for sharing This recipe makes enough for two generous (or four small) blizzards, so modify the ingredient amountsas you see fit!

Call all your friends, prepare this delicious chocolate blizzard base, then providea lineupof mix-ins: Bananas, chocolate chips, M&amp;Ms, peanut butter cups, cooconutwhip, oreos, etc. You get the idea! Then everyone can mix in their favorite toppings and finallybe happy. This summer heat beckons for cooling offwith cold treats. Do it!

0,Vegan Omelet | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Omelet  If you’re vegan, I’ll take a wild guess that eggs were one of the last thingsyou struggled to give up. That and ice cream. Although I’m not 100%vegan, I do eat a mostly animal-free diet and I’d like to continue finding ways to fuel and satisfy my body on a plant-based diet. I grew up loving eggs and ate them most mornings into adulthood. Unfortunately, a couple of months ago, John and Igot a nasty case of food poisoning that left me with zero appetite for eggs. As in: none-point-none. Now that we’re fully recovered and our appetites have mostly normalized, eggs have started to sound goodagain. But I’d like to see if I can get my egg fix elsewhere.  I had a random internal dialogue that went something like this. “Hmm, eggs are good. I wish there were vegan eggs. Never tried a tofu scramble. Maybe I should do that. Ooh, a vegan omelet! Yep, I’m doing that.” I did a little research on vegan omelets and a few great cooks have mastered the basic technique and paved the way for me to make my own interpretation of this delectable dish. My7-ingredient base starts with silken tofu – creamy, blend-able, and full of protein. Then flavor is added from hummus, nutritional yeast, sauteed garlic, and paprika. Sautee veggies add extrafiber, nutrition, and texture. Even though it doesn’t look likeeggs before cooking, the finished result is nearly identical to the real thing!  How do they compare in flavor? Pretty spot on. Someone would probably guess it wasn’t eggs, but it wouldn’t be thatobvious. I personally love this omelet and am thankful it’s a legitimate alternative to the real thing! What to expect: Slightly crisp on the outside Tender on the outside Fluffy Savory Satisfying A beautiful golden hue Stuffedwith sauteed veggies &amp; Packed with nutrition (22 grams of protein!) If you’re on the fence about eggs but still love a good omelet or scramble,this is the recipe for you. I will gladlybe hoppingon the tofu omelet bandwagon without looking back. Cheers!

(Rhonda, if you raise your hand one more time, I swear…)  I’ve been on quite the ice cream kick lately…well, for the last 27 years. Before completely dropping dairy last year I was having ice cream at least once a week. Hello Dairy Queen twist cone with sprinkles (&lt;- the best). Now that it’s officially summer and I’m off dairy but still craving the sweet, creamy stuff, I just have to make it myself! And when it turns out this good, I’m totally OK with that.   This ice cream is so simple, requiring no fancy methods and just 10 ingredients! Likely items you already have on hand too, especially if you’re vegan or dairy free. If you were to tour my pantry at any given time, you’d likely find multiple cans of coconut milk, lots of raw cashews, and an eggplant or two. You never know when you need to whip up a dairy-free pasta or dessert.   In addition to requiring simple ingredients, it’s also fast to make! Once blended, simply chill your batter for 1 hour in the freezer and then add to an ice cream maker. While it’s churning, whip up your cookie dough. In the last few minutes, throw in the dough! It’s super easy and SO worth your time.   Look at that creamy goodness. And once you freeze it up, it somehow gets even more delicious. You’re going to loveit.

It’s like a hug in a cone. Trust me. I ate one and it totally felt like a hug (maybe better).   I don’t have to sell you on this anymore. MAKE this ice cream!

0,Simple Vegan Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Favorite Vegan Pizza  Ahh, pizza night. A thing to be cherished. Around our house we eat pizza at least once a week. And if something horrific happens midweek (say, we run out of Netflix shows), it’s pizza night on Wednesday, too. Because life is short and we love our pizza and we intend to eat it. Often.  One of my greatest struggles since going completely dairy-free has been giving up my beloved veggie pie. I’m not even that bigof a cheese fan, but pizza just wasn’t pizza if there wasn’ta thick layer of mozzarella and a little parmesan on top. Ya know? But, the constant feelings of discomfort it would bring made itnot worth it to me. So we reassessedour weekly pizza routine and decided to start making all of our pizzas at home – one without cheese for me and one with cheese for John.  Thank goodness for me there is a 1-minute, homemade alternative to parmesan cheese. Vegan parmesan! Have you tried it? If not, you must. Even if you’re not vegan you’ll love it – it’s that good. You better believe I go through about 1 shaker-full every couple weeks now. It’s like gold around this house!  Even though I’ve been making a variation of this pizza for a while now, a recent discovery has madeit 10x better. Sauteedveggies! My friend Lisa – who shared the genius 5-Minute Microwave Hummus idea with me – used this method for a pizza she maderecently and it kind of blew my mind how good it was. I was using raw veggies before that never entirely get cooked while the crust is baking. Plus, sauteing them allows for another wave of flavor as I add a sprinkle of pizza seasoning, garlic powder and sea salt. So soft, mega flavorful and delicious.  In our 4+ years of marriage, John and I have eaten a lot of pizza together. At least 208 pizzas, if not more. So I’d like to think ofmyself as somewhat of an expert. This really is – in my opinion – the best pizza I’ve had – vegan or not! Big claims around here, but I know my stuff. I hope you enjoy this pie!

However,I’m elated to reportthat if you can master my World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls(and you totally can),you can master the World’s Easiest Vegan Sticky Buns, too!  It all starts with a simple dough that rises in 1 hour. To keep things a little on the healthier side, I went with a 2:1 mix of unbleached all purpose and whole wheat pastry flour for slightly-hearty-but-still-decadent roll. You could alsogo entirely all-purpose for true bakery style, all whole-wheat pastry for a healthier roll, orsome other combination that I haven’t thought of! I suspect part spelt flour would work swimmingly.  So how are these simple? I’m glad you asked. 9 ingredients (pecans being the 9th and optional ingredient) One truerise=less waiting Fool-proof methods No fancy techniques or equipment involved See? You can totally do this.Believe it.  If you’re wondering how these sticky buns get their ooey-gooey glaze, it’s simple: From a simple brown sugar, vegan butter mixture that you spread in the bottom of the baking dish. Then you add pecans and your unbaked rolls and bake until fluffy and golden brown. Wait a few minutes, invert the pan, and voila! You have bakery-worthy sticky buns that will mystify your friends and family as to how you made them. Go you.  So what do these studs taste like? Amazing. They’re Soft Tender Fluffy Sweet Perfectly spiced Sticky Cinnamon-y Loadedwith pecans &amp; Better with each bite  I could hardly stand taking photos of these rolls. Look at them! I wanted to inhale the whole batch and forgo photographs altogether. But I managedto hold off 30 minutes for pictures before I delighted in one from the center of the batch. If you’ve ever eaten a cinnamon roll or sticky bun, you know it’s kind of like unwrapping a treasure. You start from the outside and work your way in until you get to that last, sticky center bite that undoubtably has the most sugar and butter. Savor that bite, friends. Savor it like it’s never going to happen again. Then repeat! These rolls are simply amazing and so easy to make. DO IT.   If you give these a go, let me know how you liked them!

And making them vegan and gluten free AND without butter is even easier. You can trust me – I’m still kind of a cookie novice in the baking world. Pancakes and ice cream are more my game. These cookies fit the minimalist bill requiring just 7 simple ingredients, and they require just one mixing bowl and one baking sheet.

They either weren’t flavorful enough or the texture was off. And I wasn’t about to fry them, so back to the drawing board I went. This time, success!  The secret here is the panko bread crumbs,which I seasoned namely with salt, sugar and cinnamon. It gives the tots a crispy outer crust with tons of flavor.  The next essential step is baking them until they’re golden brown and slightly crisp. The longer you bake, the crispier they’ll get. It’s magic.  The result is kind of perfect. These tots are: Crispy on the outside Tender on the inside Perfectly sweet Subtly cinnamon-y Like sweet potato fries crammed into a tot &amp; Kind of perfect You could make these to serve alongside sandwiches orveggie burgers, breakfasty things, brunch, or on their own with other snacky appetizers like these vegan jalapeno poppers or cotija corn dip!

0,Microwave Hummus Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Best Ever 5-Minute Microwave Hummus  A few weeks ago I went to a friend’s bridal shower where we all pitched in toprovide a handsome spread of food and drink. I was on wine and smoothie duty and my friend Lisa made the hummus. I’ll be honest: Iwas expecting was another standardhummus that was good but didn’t taste as good as restaurant-style. What I wasn’texpecting was to eatsome of the best hummus of my life. For reals. Ready for this recipe? I’m SO excited to share it with you!  A few bites in whenmy mind finally wrapped around what my mouth was tasting, I turned to Lisa and asked how she made it. Lisa: “Well, I started with a can of chickpeas and microwaved itwith garlic…” Me: “Wait, why microwave?” Lisa: “Hey, Idon’t know these things, this is just how it’s done.” Me: “OK, KEEP GOING.” She explained it was a recipe from her brother- and sister-in-law who were both amazing cooks and caterers on the side. The concept is to cookthe garlic cloves in with the chickpeas (liquid and all) so it gets SUPER creamy and takes on a extra garlicky flavor. It also seems to meld all of the flavorstogether a bit more to give it an ultra luxurious finish.  Microwave before and after. See the difference? It may seem subtle, but the flavor/texture pay off is MAJOR. The other kicker? 1/2 cup tahini. HALF CUP. Just trust me. Best hummus ever.  Once your chickpeas and garlic are microwaved, add straight to a food processor or blender with your tahini, lemon juice, sea salt and a bit of olive oil. Then whirl until creamy and smooth and prepare yourself for themost insanely delicious hummus of yo life.  Though this hummus comes together in 5 minutes, it’s going to be hot! So, I recommend making it ahead of time and refrigerating it so it gets even more thick and the flavors can meld together. I don’t know how arefrigerator can make this diptaste 13x better, but it just does. Trust me.  You guys are going to LOVE this hummus!

One problem though:store-bought dairy-free ice creams are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced and you only get like 2 tablespoons. Obviously, I had to make my own. The flavor I wanted to go for was bourbon vanilla. Myfirst attempt turned out more like a slushythan it did ice cream. Waaaa. Back to the drawing board.  Round 2 was a total success! I accidentally made bourbon caramel whilst trying to cook down the bourbon so it would allow the ice cream to freeze. SO amazing! Even though it subdued the taste of the bourbon, the addition of the caramel note was mind blowing, so we’re rolling with it! This ice cream requires just 9 ingredients and is super simple to make! It’s cashew-based with a heavy touch of full fat coconut milk. It’s infused with bourbon caramel two ways: once in the base and a second time with a last minute swirl while it’s churning. So amazing.

0,Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Raspberry Rhubarb Crisp  Quick, before summer turns everyone’s house into a sauna, turn your oven on and make this crisp!   This is the ultimate lazy girl’s crisp. It’s rustic and fuss-free and utilizes fresh OR frozen fruit, whatever you happen to have on hand. It also requires just 8 ingredients total and is entirely vegan and gluten free. Huzzah!   The magic begins by adding your fruit to a buttered baking dish and tossing with a bit of sugar. Because we’re using rhubarb and raspberry – two relatively neutral and tart fruits – I find this step essential. Otherwise the fruit will lack some flavor and that sweetness you’re going for with a crisp.  For the crisp topping, we’re working with oats and nuts! This recipe is adapted from my Nectarine Strawberry Crisp – another must try this summer. Almond meal, crushed pecans and rolled oats make up the base while vegan butter (or olive oil) bring moisture and brown sugar a touch of sweetness. Into the oven it goes for 45 minutes to 1 hour and it’s ready! Invite friends over immediately and dig in.   This crisp is perfect for summer. It’s Packed with fruit Perfectly sweet Hearty Slightly Tart Nutty Studded with oats Simple and fuss-free &amp; Healthy enough for brunch or a late-night dessert It’s also extremely customizable. If you don’t have pecans, sub walnuts or extra almonds. If you don’t have vegan butter, sub olive oil. And if you can’t get your hands onrhubarb or raspberries, use whatever summer fruit you can get your hands on (blueberries and blackberries would be a lovely combo).  Of course, what would a crisp be without ice cream? Tune back in this weekend for yet another ultra creamy, entirely vegan ice cream recipe that’s going to blow your mind. Cheers!

0,Healthy Chocolate Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy Brownie Granola Bars  Hello friends! How was yourweekend? Awesome, I hope. John and I did somerelaxing, brunching, pizza-ing, and working on a new food photography product.I also bought and returned a pair of overpriced yoga pants out of sheer buyer’s remorse. Does that ever happen to you? Sometimes, we just have to make mistakes like that in life. It’s been a week since I’ve eaten ALL of these granola bars, but I’m still dreaming about them and peekingin the freezer to make sure I didn’t overlook one last piece. They’re that good.  These brownie granola bars kind of started out as a failure. The idea was to make date-sweetened brownies and I resorted to adapting my go-to Vegan GF Black Bean Brownies. Problems ensued. I ate one and had to throw the rest away. Not good. Not good at all. Back to the drawing board.  In life do you ever find yourself trying to fita square peg in a round hole? That’s what I was doing with these brownies. I wanted date-sweetened brownies but the blog universe was telling me something different. When I’m trying to fit my square recipe into a round hole, I rethink it. The result was a simple, naturally-sweetened, healthy granola bar that was a little on the decadent side – just the way I like it.  These bars DO indeed taste like a raw brownie. They require just 7 ingredients. They’re no bake, aside from toasting your oats and nuts (an optional step). They’re loaded with antioxidants, fiber, protein and healthy fats. They’re incredibly satisfying. They’re perfect for breakfast, dessert or a quick snack. They’re freezer-friendly. They’re uber chocolaty. They’re really just kind of perfect.  So what do they taste like? Supreme awesomeness. They’re Rich Dense Moist SUPER chocolaty Nutty Oaty Slightly crunchy Perfectly sweet &amp; Mega filling I did have one for breakfast and found it quite filling. But for the most part I ate these as a healthy dessert. I’d go to the freezer, break off 1/3 and snack. Thenrepeat for the next 30 minutes until it was gone. Self control comes in waves, people, especially with these bars.  You MUST try these bars and let me know what you think! Tag a photo (#minimalistbaker) on Instagram or @minimalistbaker onTwitter so I can see how lovely yours turn out. Happy brownie making!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/healthy-brownie-granola-bars/
0,Strawberry Rhubarb Pop-Tarts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Strawberry Rhubarb Pop-Tarts  Yep, it’s happening. A rhubarb invasion on the blog. Prepare yourself.   When planning out recipes for the month of June I was plotting many ways to feature rhubarb. It’s such a curious plant and I just had to employ it. Myfirst memoryof having rhubarb was during a road trip I took with my friend Ashley years ago. After touring 7 states we landed at her parents’ house in rural Idaho where their garden was abundant with the stuff. While Ashley’s mom made us dinner one evening, her dad baked a pie: strawberry rhubarb. It was so delicious I knew I had to get my hands on some and try it for myself.  The funny thing about rhubarb is, it’s elusive. It doesn’t peek its head until late April, early May and only remains seen for a certain stretch of summer. Which is why I was anxious to get my hands on some come spring. Well, after multiple phone calls to area grocery stores and failed attempts at picking some up at markets, I finally spotted some and when I did, I stocked up. Consider this the first of at least two rhubarb recipes in June if not more.  So these pop tarts. They’re amazing. They’re made with whole grain pastry. They’re flaky and perfectly sweet. They’re loaded with rhubarb and strawberry compote. They require 7 ingredients. They’re vegan. They’re adapted from my VeganBerry Pop Tarts (a must try). They don’t need frosting but, why not? Life is short.  You simply must try these pop tarts. They’re the perfect way to celebrate summer fruit and indulge in a little something sweet. If you do, snapa picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. You guys know I love it when you show me what recipes you’re making from the blog. So get to baking and then get to Instagramming.Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-strawberry-rhubarb-pop-tarts/
0,Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Peanut Tofu &amp; Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry One bite in and I knew I hit the jackpot with this one. If you’ve been in search of the perfect crispy, baked tofu recipe, this is the onefor you! I’m so excited to share this with you guys I can hardly stand it. Let’s do this! For starters, this dish is served overcauliflower “rice” instead of regular rice because 1) Cruciferous veg for the win, and 2) You can eat an ENTIRE head of cauliflower instead of 1/2 cup of rice and STILL only consume a fraction of the calories and carbohydrates, so why not?! Cauliflower rice is SOsimple and you absolutely must try it! It doesn’t passcompletely as rice since the textures and flavors are slightly different. But it looks just like rice and in my opinion, tastes even better as it absorbs the sauce perfectly and takes WAY less time to cook. You guys know the deal: My favorite way to crisp up tofu is pre-baking it before sauteing – a little trick I picked up at a vegetarian cafe in San Antonio (Yes, I hounded the waitress for the technique – you’re welcome). This gives it that crisp outer edge and perfectly tender center. Once your tofu is baked, add it to your sauce, which acts as an all-in-one marinade and sauce for the cauliflower rice, veggies and for serving! It wears many hats and it’s oh-so delicious and Thai-inspired.  Once your tofu is marinated, it’s ready for a quick stir fry to give it that perfectly golden brown, crisp, mega-flavorful coating. Then all that’s left to do is saute up your veggie of choice – baby bok choy for the win – and your cauliflower rice! All in all this dish takes around 1 hour 30 minutes, which is a little longer than I prefer. But the pay off is so worth it! Plus, it only requires 9 ingredients – many of which you likely already have on hand.  You’re going to love this dish! It’s Savory Satisfying Super Peanut-y Perfectly sweet Not-too-spicy Loadedwith flavor Packed with veggies Entirely vegan + gluten-free (with GF soy sauce) &amp; Perfect for a night in I made this dish and ate half, then reheated the leftovers the next day and I swear it got better! I love it when that happens.Hope you enjoy this dish as much as I did. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/crispy-peanut-tofu-cauliflower-rice-stir-fry/
0,Vegan Caramelized Onion Mac 'n' Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Caramelized Onion Mac ‘n’ Cheese  The minute I discovered you canmake queso without cashews, I was convinced cashew-less mac ‘n’ cheese had to happen. Eggplant cheese sauce seriously knowsno bounds.   I’ve made vegan mac ‘n’ cheese before using a cashew-based sauce and it really was amazing! But the issue with cashews is that they make recipes so heavy with their high fat and calorie content. Not that I’m a calorie counter, butI’m all for lightening up recipes whenI can. Eggplant sauce to the rescue.  This eggplant sauce is so simple to make – just a 10-minute roast before peeling the skin and adding it to the blender. It’s infused withnutritional yeast, garlic powder and sea salt for that ultimate cheesy, savory flavor. I could’ve eaten that sauce all by itself, but the noodles were calling…  The thing that sends this mac ‘n’ cheese over the top is the caramelized onions and the crispy breadcrumbs! While the sauce and noodles meldperfectly together, the addition ofcaramel-y, browned onions and crispy bread crumbs on top sends the flavor profile through the roof! I could’ve eaten this whole pan by myself – no lie.  You’re going to love this dish. It’s Creamy Comforting Warm Cheesy Super saucy Savory Satisfying Slightly crisp on top &amp; Totally share-worthy Make this for vegan and non-vegan friends alike and watch their jaws drop after the first bite. It’s just that good!  If you make this recipe, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I love seeing what you lovelies cook up. Cheers!

0,Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream Cake  If you’re one of those (few) people with mass amounts of self control, you were able to save yourVegan Mint Brownie Ice Cream until today! Phew, that was rough. How did you do it? Here’s what I propose we do with that creamy, minty, dream boat ice cream: MAKE AN ICE CREAM CAKE!  I’ve loved ice cream cake since I was a wee little Minimalist Baker. I mean, cake AND ice cream? Come on. But I haven’t had itsince my dairy sensitivity really flared up last year and said, “Hey, lady, stop that. Dairy makes you feel like crap.” Fine, body. Although you’re right, you’re still a giant party pooper.  This ice cream cake is made with our 1-Bowl Vegan Chocolate Cake! It’s the perfect chocolate cake for vegan newbies and skilled bakers alike because it requires just one bowl, no fancy ingredients, and comes together in about 1 hour. Plus, it’s mega delicious. Read the comments. While your cake is baking and cooling, you can get on making your ice cream (if you haven’t already done so, champ).  Once your cake is cooled and your ice cream is softened, it’s time to build that cake. You can do so in two ways (probably more). Basically you’re just trying to layer the cake and ice creamin as uniform fashion as possible. I went with a loaf pan for easy sculpting, but you could also use a cake stand and just frost the cake with the ice cream like “frosting.” If you do this, you’re fancy and I’m jealous of your skills. The best part is, it doesn’t have to be perfect or even pretty because it tastes AMAZING.  You guys are going to LOVE this cake. It’s Fudgy Creamy Chocolaty Sweet Perfectly minty Studded with fudgy brownie bites Mega satisfying &amp; Perfect for sharing Do you have a birthday? Yes, you do! (I know you do. You’re lying, RHONDA.) May I suggest something? Make this cake for yo’ birthday! Or make this pie, I mean, come on. Either way, make this cake! Cheers, friends.  P.S. You know the drill. If you make this cake (or just inhale the ice cream on its own), let me know! Tag your photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram so I can see. It makes my day, seriously.

0,Vegan Mint Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegan Mint Brownie Ice Cream  Where do I even start? Perhaps by telling you this is the creamiest, dreamiest mint ice cream you’ll ever feast on. And that it’s loaded with raw brownie chunks. YES, brownie chunks. No wimpy chocolate chipshere. Oh, and that it’s entirely vegan and gluten-free. Whoo, that wasa mouthful, but you need to know it all!  I used to despise minteverything, especially desserts. Mint belonged in fluorideand toothpaste as far as I was concerned; nowhere near my ice cream. But then, one night at my aunt’s house, I was offered a piece of chocolate cake and the only ice cream availablewas mint chip. OK, fine. If it’s the only option. I was desperate. I hate to admit it, but, I fell in love.  This ice cream is based loosely on my chai ice cream(Which has a video, by the way. Have you seen it!?). It’s cashew-based, which makesit ultra creamy and thick. Coconut milk gives it an ultra velvety finish and pairs perfectly with the fresh mint. If you love mint, you’re in luck because this ice cream gets its minty-ness from twosources: fresh mint leaves and peppermint extract. I don’t mess around.  While your ice cream is churning, make your raw brownie. This is the most bare bones raw brownie recipe you can make: dates, raw nuts(I love a mix ofraw walnuts and almonds), and cacao or cocoa powder (although cocoa makes it not technically “raw”). Mix it all together and then form it into a little brownie brick and let it chill while your ice cream gets all soft serve like. Try not to eat it all (important).  Yes! The moment has come to add the brownie. You don’t need toadd it all, unless you really want to. But I like the emphasis to be on the ice cream with bites of brownie in most every bite. Plus, then I can snack on leftover brownie brick the rest of the week (huzzah!).   Friends! This ice cream is a dream. It’s: Creamy Smooth Cold Minty Perfectlysweet Velvety Studded with raw brownie bites Chocolaty Luscious &amp; Altogether irresistible Make it for yourself or share it with friends! OR, exercise the utmost self-control and save it for a killer recipe I have coming up for you guys this weekend! Stay tuuuuuned.  If you make this recipe, yo, let me know.

0,Greek Salad with Wheat Berries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mediterranean Wheat Berry Salad  John and I eat Mediterranean food at least once a week, oftenin the form of a hummus snack plate for lunch. It’s so simple, healthyand satisfying, andit’s something we always agree on. Beyond whipping up hummus and falafel,my Mediterranean/Greek food skills werelacking. It was time for that tochange.  A few years ago when we were still living in Portland, I accompanied a friend to afarmers market where I experienceda Greek wheat berry salad that kind of changed my life. Well, that’s dramatic. But I remember it was one of the first meals that proved to meyou really don’t need meat or gobs of peanut butter to fill you up. The idea to recreate that salad at home stuckwith me, and I’m so glad it finallysurfaced.  You’re going to love this simple salad. It’s hearty, customizable year-round, and requires just 10 ingredients including the simple Greekdressing. It all starts with wheat berries – a whole grain that’s nutty with a slight chew and loaded withfiber, vitamins and minerals.  Next come roasted onions and leeks, baby tomatoes, kalamata olives, and a 5-ingredient savory Greek dressing.  It all meldstogether to create a seriouslyhearty, flavorful Greek salad perfect for lunch, dinner or a snack. The wheat berries provide chew and heartiness, the roasted veggieswarm things up andadd a comforting touch, and olives andtomatoes keep itlight and fresh.  Serve this salad asis or with your favorite add-ins. I enjoyed mine withgarlic hummus and pita chips. You could also throw in some fresh greens for more nutrition. Took me right back to the farmers market where I inhaled my first Mediterranean wheat berry salad out of a paper cup in the summer sun. Good memories. I hope you make this salad and enjoy it much as I did. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/mediterranean-wheat-berry-salad/
0,Peanut Butter Mousse Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter Mousse Cups  This recipe came from another late-night revelation just before drifting off to sleep. “PEANUT BUTTER MOUSSE CUPS! John, don’t let me forget this one.” It must be so oddbeing married to a food blogger…  You guyslovedmy 3-ingredient peanut butter mousse, which acts asthe filling for these dreamy, chilled 5-ingredient peanut butter cups. I’ve made peanut butter cup pie, peanut butter cup pancakes, peanut butter M&amp;Ms, and peanut butter eggs before, but this takes my chocolate-peanut butter obsession to a whole new level.   It starts with a dark chocolate shell, which is chilled before getting plumped up with coconut whipped cream infused with salted, natural peanut butter and a little powdered sugar.  You can top these guys two ways: Totally covered with chocolate for a classic PB cup look, or lightly drizzled with chocolate so there’s less mystery as to what’s inside. No matter which way you go, you can’t go wrong with the combo of chocolate + peanut butter.   So what do they taste like? Heaven!

0,Summer Berry Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Summer in a Cup Smoothie  I recently helped throw a bridal shower for a friend and it was the host’s brilliant idea to have a smoothie baralong with gourmet s’mores arounda fire pit. Best, shower, ever. I was selected as the smoothie recipe generator, so I offered up a few variationsthat were made into recipe cards for the guests to follow. This recipe for Summer in a Cup was one of them, which just so happened to be a total fave among guests. If you like berries, citrus and sweet-creamy smoothies,this is the recipe for you.  It starts with frozen banana and loads of frozen raspberries. This provides a cold, creamy-thick base, as well as a sweet-tart flavor contrast. Next comes unsweetened Almond Breeze almond milk, orange juice and pomegranate juice for the perfect mix of creamy, sweet and tart. This smoothie truly is summer in a cup.  What’s it taste like? Mega creamy Cold Perfectly sweet Not too tart Refreshing Citrusy &amp; Satisfying Of all of the smoothies I’ve made (and I’ve made a lot), this is definitely one of my favorites to date! If you want, add a handful of greens for extra nutrition (although it will likely turn it a not-so-flattering hue). Add silken tofu for a protein boost.

0,Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Quinoa Salad Cups with Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing  A few weeks back John and I went to my sister’s house for dinner. We can all agree on Mexican food, so taco salads it was. Salsa and sour cream are obvious toppingsfor traditional taco salads, but for something dairy-free I went witha creamy cilantro-lime dressing that I made up on the spot. It was so good I was inspired to make this recipe and douse it in the stuff. Green gold, I call it. If you’re in the marketfor a satisfying vegan and gluten free appetizer or entree, this is the recipe for you.  The whole thing comes together in about 30 minutes and is madewith some seriously healthy eats: Spiced,Roasted Sweet Potatoes Quinoa Black Beans Dark Leafy Lettuce Avocados Limes Cilantro &amp; Olive Oil  While your sweet potatoes and quinoa are cooking, whip up your dressing! It requires just 6 ingredients and is SO creamy and flavorful. Avocadoprovidesplenty ofhealthy fat, fiber and a little protein, and makes the texture super creamy. Flavor comes from sea salt, lime juice, cumin, agave and cilantro. Olive oil adds more healthy fat and a velvety finish. This stuff is so dang good, and it makes about 1 cup worth! So keep leftovers in a jar for other salads and Mexican dishes throughout the week.  Next comes assembly! Simply arrange your lettuce on a plate and top with quinoa, black beans, roasted sweet potatoes, and a bit of the cilantro-lime dressing.  John and I split these for lunch and polished the plate! They’re so light, flavorful and healthy, yet entirely satisfying. If you have vegan or vegetarian friends, they’ll definitely love you for makingthese. But I think they’re fillingenough to please even hearty meat eaters. If you give them a shot, let me know! Take a photo and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram. I’d love to see! Cheers.

0,Mango Green Tea Popsicles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mango Green Tea Pops  Last summer I strucka serious love affair with mangos. They’re so creamy, satisfying and naturally sweet (and super healthy), and lend themselves perfectly tosmoothies, sorbet, and Popsicles!  Yep, it’s about that time. Summer is almost here and it already feels like it in the Midwest. I’ve already started setting my alarm to get up earlyso I can squeeze in my morning walk/run without burning up. Around thistime I start craving cold things in the morning like cereal and smoothies. And in the afternoon? Ice cream and popsicles is the way to go.  This recipe is super simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 5 ingredients! Mango, matcha green tea powder, coconut milk, agave (or sweetener or choice) and lemon juice. If you don’t have a popsicle mold, just use my dixie cup and wooden spoon method (works like a charm). If you’ve never experienced matcha you’re missing out. It’s basically green tea on steroids because it’s green tea leaves ground into edible powder. Hiiii-ya! When ingested straight instead of diluted tea form, you’re getting more than 10 times the vitamins, minerals, and cancer-fighting antioxidants green tea provides. NOTE:Not all matcha is created equal!In my experience, the more vibrantthe green huethe better. I found this extensive review by Healthy Happy Lifeextremely insightful. Check it out if you’re in the market for some matcha this summer.  These pops are magic in the mouth.

0,Vegan Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuits | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuits  I don’t crave biscuits often, but when I do I want one that’s serious: Super fluffy, buttery and fresh out of the oven. For that, thankfully I have my go-to Best Damn Vegan Biscuit. But a girl has to have more than one biscuit recipe in her arsenal if you ask me, so I went back to the drawing board.  I’ve been on a bit of a nutrition yeast kick lately and have been putting it on everything, especially pizza and pasta. And if you’ve been reading Minimalist Baker for a while now, you know I adorespicy food. So it was natural to wantto try my take on a cheddar jalapeño biscuit. I’m happy to report that the result was a massive success. These little golden gems are the real deal!  It starts with your basic dry ingredients plus nutritional yeast! That’s what gives it that amazing yellow color and cheesy flavor. The rest is simple: Mix your dry ingredients while your vegan buttermilk activates,thencut in your vegan butter or coconut oil. Next, stir in your jalapeños andadd your buttermilk and stir. Form into a disc, cut and butter! That’s it – the whole process takes about 10-15 minutes. And the result is so worth it: A beautiful, buttery, tender biscuit just asking to be devoured.I mean, come on…look at these guys.  These biscuits are legit! They’re: Buttery Warm Savory “Cheesy” Fluffy Tender Slightly spicy &amp; Perfect with a little vegan butter and maple syrup (What?

Next comes walnuts, and we all know how high in healthy fats and protein and omega-3s they are. I try to eat a few every day! Plus, they add a nutty,hearty bite to the black-rice filling.

0,Vegan Cashew-Less Queso Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cashew-Less Vegan Queso  It always happens. Just as I’m about to drift off to sleep at night, a recipe idea zings into my brain out of nowhere. This time, for vegan queso.  EXCITING NEWS. I’ve tried vegan cheese based with cashews. It’s good, and it’s the first way I learned to mock cheese texture and flavor without using dairy. But I knew there had to be a better way. I mean, not that I’m into counting calories, but cashews are very high in calories and fat and you can detect them in sauces unless you really build up the flavor from spices and otherwise. So, the thought was, “What else is creamy but neutral and would make a good base for cheese sauce?” The zinger I got at midnight whilst falling asleep: EGGPLANT!  Eggplant is amazingly versatile, especially once roasted. I enjoy it in pastas, whirled into baba ganoush or even roasted and layered into a hearty veggie sandwich. I adore the creaminess of baba ganoush and suspected its eggplant base would make an excellent base for vegan queso. DING DING DING. I was correct.   This sauce starts with roasted eggplant. I speed up the process by slicing it into thin rounds and broiling. A little steam in foil and then you can pull away the skin with ease. Then, just throw it into a blender with almond milk, nutritional yeast and a handful of spices and you’re good to go. Look at that creamy queso goodness.  A little cornstarch in the mix helps it thicken up once heated in a saucepan for serving. This is an optional step but I recommend it for that ultimate luxurious cheesy texture. (If you don’t use cornstarch, try another thickener, such as arrowroot powder.)  All that’s left to do is add in a few Tbsp of slightly drained Rotel (just like real queso dip!) or your favorite chunky salsa. This really sends the texture and flavor over the top to mock the real thing.  Oh. My. Word. You’re not gonna believe how delicious this is. And guess what? HUSBAND APPROVED! John tried it, and he doesn’t like cashew sauces, and he really liked this dip! We agreed that it was ridiculous how close it was to real queso dip. Seriously amazing!  So what does it taste like? Creamy Velvety Savory Super cheesy Slightly spicy Perfectly dippable Totally pourable Begging to be added to all your favorite dishes Don’t worry. I have a few recipes in the works utilizing this dreamy dip! And another bonus: It reheats extremely well! If you’ve ever made cashew cheese you know it doesn’t exactly reheat well. But with this, you can just pop it in the microwave or put it back in a saucepan and it’s just as good!  Yet ANOTHER bonus? This dip is cashew-, soy-, dairy-, and gluten-free! And did I mention it’s way lighter in fat and calories than nut- and dairy-based quesos? Just 55 calories and 3.5 grams of (healthy) fat per serving! What’s not to love? Make this dip!

0,Sweet Potato Dessert Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Superfood Sweet Potato Dessert Fries  Once I discovered the magic that is sweet potato fries years ago, there was no going back. Sure, I still enjoy the occasional traditional fry but I almost always go for sweet. What’s not to love? They’re sweet, perfect with salt, tender, slightly crispy and delicious with just about any dip (ketchup me, please). That being said, I couldn’t help but take my affection for sweet potato fries beyond savory settings. I kept dreaming about this big pile of sweet potato fries doused in all things sweet. Turns out, this was a good idea. Next girls night I have, I know what I’m making.  Just because these are dessert fries doesn’t mean they’re unhealthy. In fact, they pack in 5 superfoods in their warm, sticky-sweet glory. This is cause for celebration if you ask me. It all starts with baked sweet potato fries, lightly dressed in olive oil and salt. Then comes the sauce. Peanut butter lovers rejoice!  If you aren’t into peanut butter or just prefer almond, go that route instead. Next time I make these I think I’ll go that route because sweet potato and almond butter are simply meant to be together. But you can never go wrong with peanut butter. What’s next? Oh yes – DARK CHOCOLATE.  I melted some dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips and poured it on. So seriously good. If you’ve never experiencedsweet potatoes and dark chocolate, you’re simply missing out.  Last but not least? Coconut whipped cream, toasted nuts, and pomegranate arils. Oh mama.  So where do all these super food health benefits come in? Allow me to explain. Nuts – Nuts are high in protein, healthy fats, fiber, vitamins and arginine, which can help lower blood pressure. Some research has even found that regular consumption of nuts can help you live longer. They also steady blood sugar, lower cholesterol and can help fight dementia. Sweet Potatoes – Gorgeous sweet potatoes are packed with nutritional benefits. They’re high in vitamin B6, vitamin C (wards of cold and flu viruses and keeps the skin youthful), vitamin D (stabilizes energy levels, mood and promotes healthy bones, nerves, skin and teeth), iron (promotes healthy immune function), magnesium (promotes healthy artery, blood, bone, heart, muscle and nerve function). They’re also high in carotenoids like beta carotene, which helps strengthen eyesight and boost the immune system. Coconut – Although high in saturated fat, coconut has been found to contain medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently by the body than long chain fatty acids (the kind found in high-fat fried foods and animal products). Coconuts are also high in fiber, vitamins C, E and B vitamins, as well as iron, selenium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous. Pomegranate – Pomegranates are high in B vitamins, potassium, folic acid and iron. Pomegranate juice has been found to help improve blood flow, and their anti-inflammatory properties may help prevent cancer. Dark Chocolate – Found to possibly decrease stroke risk and lower blood pressure. Dark chocolate is high in fiber and antioxidants, which help prevent cancer and protect skin from UV damage. Regular consumption can also boost your mood, improve blood flow, and even perk up your vision. Need I say more? You need this big plate of super food dessert in your life.  This is the type of dessert that needs to be eaten fresh! It’s not nearly as delicious once cooled and doesn’t keep well. So invite over a few friends to enjoy these. Otherwise, just slim down the ingredients to suit one – I generally recommend 1 sweet potato per person. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/superfood-sweet-potato-dessert-fries/
0,Vegan Cheez Its | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cheez Its  Either you love Cheez Its or you don’t. If you’re in the camp of total fan girls, this is the recipe for you!  If you’ve ever tried Cheez Its you know how salty and cheesy they are. It’s kind of addictive if you favor savory foods. Well, the thing is, a little sea salt and nutritional yeast (nutrition diva and flavor bomb) can totally mock that flavor of the real thing without going into dairy land! It’s kind of like magic.  The awesome thing about this recipe – besides the fact that it requires just 8 ingredients – is that it’s quick and considerably healthy! A mix of flours give a bit more nutritional value (oat and cornmeal + unbleached all-purpose) and instead of going for all vegan butter, I mixed in some olive oil for added nutrition. The nutritional yeast and cornmeal are what give it that vibrant yellow “cheesy” color.  About 15 minutes in the oven and you’re good to go! These taste very close to the original, I’m telling you! John even agreed and he’s a harsher critic than I. I think you’re going to love these; they’re Salty Tender Slightly crisp Ridiculously cheezy Kind of addictive &amp; Highly shareable  I hope you enjoy this vegan knock-off recipe! And if you do try it, be sure to take a photo and post it to Instagram with the hashtag #minimalistbaker. I’d love to see! Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-cheez-its/
0,Thai Kale Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crunchy Thai Kale Salad  Although we eat dinner together most evenings, sometimes John and I crave different things. It’s no secret that I generally want something healthy and light and he is desiring something a bit more satisfying. Most nights I can whip up something that’s a compromise – something filling but with tons of veggies like black bean tacos, Pad Thaior pizza. But other nights, we agree to disagree and go our separate ways. And on those nights I usually make a big green salad.  This salad is one that I’ve been making recently when I’m craving Thai food but don’t have time time to make anything complicated. It’s not authentic by any means but certainly Thai-inspired with the peanut sauce, fresh vegetables and tofu.  The whole thing comes together in about 20 minutes, starting with the greens. I prepare the kale by drizzling it with toasted sesame oil and agave nectar (or honey if not vegan) and massaging to flavor and soften the sometimes bitter, stiff leaves. Then I toss some lightly drained tofu in sesame seeds (a tip I learned from Sprouted Kitchen Cookbook), to give it more texture and nutritional value. If you aren’t into raw tofu (like some commenters have noted) try this easy baking method that gives it a nice bite with no additional ingredients.  Next is the dressing – my favorite part.I use my go-to 5-ingredient peanut sauce that’s the perfect balance of savory, sweet and spice. I love how it adds another layer of flavor to this crunchy, spring salad.  I don’t trust myself around peanut sauce. Whoever said 2 Tablespoons was one serving was a liar.  So easy, so fresh, so delicious. I think you’re going to love this salad. It’s Crunchy Filling Light Flavorful Peanut-y Sweet Savory Seriously healthy &amp; Super delicious Bonus? It packs incredibly well for lunch! Make it in the morning or the night before and then throw it in a Tupperwear to eat later. I ate half of mine the first day and other half the next and it was just as delicious!Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/crunchy-thai-kale-salad/
0,Vegan Chocolate Silk Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"6-Ingredient Vegan Chocolate Silk Pie  When in Bali last year we stumbled upon this super hippy dippy vegan cafe just 10 minutes from our villa. During our stay we ordered delivery many times and even went in for breakfast one morning, primarily to gawk at all of their organic baked goods. One item I knew I had to try the moment I saw it was their vegan mud pie. Not all mud pies are made equal – this I now know. For dinner one night I ordered a salad and one behemoth slice of their famed mud pie. Two bites in? Eh, kind of disappointed. How can a mud pie disappoint, you ask? I don’t know! But something was amiss. This had to be fixed (clearly).  This pie begins with a simple, 3-ingredient crust that’s essentially a raw brownie. Raw walnuts, dates, and cocoa powder (or cacao powder for a true raw brownie experience). Pressed into the bottom of a pie pan it makes the perfect crust for your 3-ingredient, fudgy chocolate filling.   This filling is so easy and so undetectably dairy-free it’s ridiculous. Silken tofu is the magic here. Before you get all, “Tofu is gross, what is it anyway, isn’t it bad for you?” hear me out, Rhonda. I too was once skeptical of tofu, but since learning about the health benefits of soy from some reputable health sources(namely Dr. Andrew Weil), I know organic, non-GMO tofu can be extremely healthy for your diet. It’s high in protein, low in fat and has even been found to lower cholesterol by up to 40 percent. I’m not a health expert nor am I recommending you start eating tofu hand over fist (it’s not for everyone). I’m just saying, it’s nothing to be afraid of! Especially when added to silky, chocolatey pies such as this.   The texture of this pie is absolutely sensational. Creamy, rich, mega chocolate-y. I had one small slice and was done for! Usually I eat large servings of dessert and hardly feel satisfied. But with this, a little goes a long way. You can serve it two ways: Chilled or frozen. I tried both and preferred mine frozen because it’s much easier to serve as it’s firmer in texture. But chilled is good too, just know it takes a little finagling to get those first couple pieces out of the pan. You can also freeze it to set, slice and then let it set out for 10-15 minutes so it’s more like pudding.  I think you’re going to love this pie! It’s Rich Creamy Velvety Mega chocolaty Super satisfying Shareable Reminiscent of mud pie &amp; A chocolate lover’s dream Plus, it has a brownie crust! What’s not to love?  Make this pie! And if you do, take a picture and tag it #minimalistbaker on Instagram! I’d love to see. Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/6-ingredient-vegan-chocolate-silk-pie/
0,Easy Coconut Curry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"30-Minute Coconut Curry  I can’t say I’ve ever been to India (though Wes Anderson has me dying to go). Nor can I even say I’ve eaten at that many authentic Indian restaurants. But I have tried a curry or two in my day and I know what I like in one. This recipe is a mix of everything I love about curry all rolled into one pan.  And what do I love most about curries? Veggies and coconut milk. Since I wanted to keep this vegetarian/vegan friendly, I served it over coconut quinoa for added protein and fiber. I have to say it was a lovely choice. It really marries the dish together well (but completely optional).  The rest of the recipe is basically veggies of your choice and a special mix of spices. I went with broccoli, carrot, onion, snow peas and tomato, but you could go with just bell peppers and onion, potatoes, cauliflower, etc. – whatever you wish! As for the spices I kept it simple with curry powder and a pinch of cayenne. But you could also just add a dried red chili for a similar effect. Extra turmeric, cinnamon or cumin would also be lovely.  The end result? A super simple, veggie-packed (vegan and GF-friendly) curry that will please a crowd. Even those on the fence about curries should try this recipe as it’s heavy on the coconut milk and light on the spices. I think you’re going to love it. It’s: Warm Comforting Satisfying Rich but healthy Not too spicy Perfectly sweet &amp; Loaded with veggies Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/30-minute-coconut-curry/
0,Simple Veggie Sliders | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Veggie Sliders  I am not the type of girl that just orders a salad every time we go out. I used to be that girl, but that was when I used to be over concerned about my thighs touching. No more. If I’m hungry, give me a burger. Half burger, half ketchup, that is, with tons o’ fries. Then I’m a happy patron.  But I’m not always big on meat. I mean, have you ever eaten a burger and then felt like you needed a 5 hour nap just to recover? Yeah, that’s me. In my quest to find the perfect veggie burger I’ve tried quite a few but never quite felt like I’d found “the one.” That had to change.  With this recipe I not only aimed to simplify veggie burgers, but also keep them flavorful and with sturdy texture. In my mind, a good veggie burger should be slightly crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and not at all “gummy.” Friends, I’m happy to report that these little gems not only require just 7 ingredients, but they also hit the nail on the head with both flavor and texture. Serious score.  The base starts with onion and mushroom, sautéed to deepen their color, flavor and texture. Then I added in a light seasoning of salt, pepper and chili powder (or cumin). Then came the mashed beans – I went with kidney to try something different than black beans, which is the legume most veggie burgers rely on. Last but not least, ground walnuts and cooked quinoa for a “dry” that not only creates a lovely crumbly texture, but also adds heaps of nutritional benefits.  I tested these two ways: 1) Thicker patties baked in the oven 2) Thinner patties sautéed in a skillet I’m happy to report that both worked! The baking takes longer but yields a better overall texture, I believe. But if you’re in a time crunch, throw them on the stovetop! They’ll do just fine.  Now, the important part. What do they taste like? I’m glad you asked. They’re Tender Slightly crisp Perfectly browned Savory Smoky Hearty Satisfying &amp; Ridiculously addictive I had one for sampling purposes, then another…The rest are just waiting to be devoured. These won’t last long around my house or yours.  This recipe yields about 10 thicker baked sliders or 16 thinner “grilled” sliders. So one batch will feed a descent-sized crowd! But if it’s just you and a friend, I’d suggest par-baking them for maybe 15 minutes and then pulling them out to freeze. Then, when you’re ready to eat one, just pop it out of the freezer and bake until warmed through and adequately browned and no longer tender. All that’s left to do is top as desired. I went with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, onion, tomato. But I’m someone of a hamburger purist, so do as you wish! I’m sure these would be awesome with avocado and salsa for more of a Mexican spin, or with cheese (vegan or not) and some vegan bacon. Dream big and eat several – they are sliders after all.Enjoy!

0,Vegan Banana French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Banana French Toast  If you love banana bread and you love french toast, you will LOVE this 5-Ingredient Vegan Banana French Toast!   That’s right, 5 ingredients. Six if you desire a splash of vanilla. But it’s not necessary! You really want the banana flavor/sweetness to shine through anyway. Plus, it takes the place of a sweetener and an egg in this recipe. Bananas seriously have it going on.  The batter is simple to throw together. Just mash your banana, add the other ingredients and wait while you preheat your griddle. Then dip, soak and cook! Look how golden crispy the edges get. SO seriously yum.   All that’s left to do is top this stack with maple syrup, more banana (and gobs of peanut butter, who am I kidding?). You’re going to love this simple french toast. It’s Moist Slightly crisp Tender Loaded with banana bread flavor Sweet Cinnamon-y Wholesome Satisfying and &amp; Super delicious The best part? You really can’t tell the egg is missing. I was pleasantly surprised!  Invite over a friend or two and make a french toast party out of it! Who would ever turn down french toast, anyway? That’s what I wanna know. (If they do, you need new friends. I’m sorry, somebody had to say it, Rhonda.) Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-vegan-banana-french-toast/
0,Vegan Parmesan Cheese Sticks | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pesto Parmesan Breadsticks  Sometimes, a girl needs just a breadstick (sans cheese). This is the breadstick for you!  While I’m not just a huge bread person, there is something ridiculously satisfying about a breadstick to round out a delicious pasta meal, or dipped straight intorich tomato sauce. I think we can all agree we could use a good breadstick recipe in our back pocket for times such as this.  To amp up the flavor of these babies vegan style, I whipped up a batch of vegan pesto! It’s super easy. You just sub vegan parmesan for the parmesan cheese (or omit it) and throw in tons of basil, nuts, and olive oil! Blend, blend, blend and you’re as good as gold. Green gold, that is. (Alternatively, just seek out a store bought vegan-friendly pesto for even quicker prep.)  This dough is based off of my favorite, go-to pizza dough. It’s fast, it’s easy, and it doubles in size like a boss. All that’s left to do is roll it out and spread with all of that green gold you must made. So, dang, tasty.  A healthy sprinkle of vegan parm and into the oven they go. Then out they come, fluffy, pillowy sticks of pesto, cheesy, breadstick goodness. Swoon.  I was so pleased with how these turned out. They’re: Fluffy Light Pesto infused Perfectly ‘cheesy’ Slightly crisp on the edges Pillowy Comforting Satisfying Shareable &amp; Perfect with pasta or marinara Friends, you’re going to love this recipe! It’s so easy and makes a ton. Freeze your leftovers for meals later in the week. If pesto isn’t your thing, just brush with olive oil and top with the parmesan cheese. You can’t go wrong with basic.

0,Vegan Garlic Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Vegan Garlic Pasta with Roasted Tomatoes  I’ve had a fairly easy time giving up a lot of my favorite dairy-containing foods over the last year (yogurt, ice cream, cheese), but pasta and pizza have been tough ones for me. Pizza, I’ve recently discovered, works great cheese-less with a healthy shake of vegan parmesan. But pasta has mainly stumped me…until now. One of the meals I’ve made for John and myself every week for the last several years is a lightened upPesto Alfredowith some form of steamed veggie. I love the richness and creamy texture it offers. While I recognize there is a place for cashew-based sauces, I wanted something so undetectably creamy that it had to be nut free. So I started with simple ingredients that I use in my original recipe, but swapped the regular milk for almond milk. As for the cheese? I supplemented other flavor in the form of shallot, garlic and roasted tomatoes. And when serving, I shake on a healthy amountvegan parm. The result?Pasta that sends me straight to creamy pasta heaven.  This is a 30-minute meal that’s virtually fool-proof. While you get your sauce going by sauteeing garlic and shallot in a little olive oil, roast your grape tomatoes. When you roast tomatoes in a little olive oil and sea salt, it enhances their natural flavor and gives them an almost smoky, fire-roasted taste, which pairs perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce.  Once your sauce is thickened you can either blend it for undetectable creaminess or leave it with a bit of texture. Then, all that’s left to do is toss in the tomatoes and garnish with fresh herbs, black pepper, or a little parm. This dish is so simple yet so flavorful! It’s: Creamy Rich Savory Garlicky Warm Comforting &amp; Surprisingly satisfying I served ours with a little steamed broccoli and, of course, some white wine. What’s white pasta without white wine? This really is the perfect quick meal for weeknights that will please even picky eaters. Don’t even mention there’s no butter or cream and I’ll bet no one will notice. Cheers!

0,Vegan French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Basic Vegan French Toast  We just celebrated our fourth wedding anniversary and it caused me to reflect on our early days of marriage, living in Portland in late spring, early summer. I made us breakfast most mornings – just like I do now – and we’d sit and talk with the windows open before getting to the day’s tasks. I discovered early on John isn’t a pancake guy. The thing is, I’m a pancake girl. But our common ground? French toast. Thank goodness.   Since going dairy-free, I haven’t made french toast as often as I used to, but I do miss it. Our favorite recipe is basic with a little cinnamon and vanilla, then topped with fresh strawberries and maple syrup or honey. I’m not entirely egg-free (though am growing more suspicious of them by the moment), but I wanted to make a vegan french toast recipe A) to see if it was in fact possible to make french toast without eggs, and B) to come up with my own variation to share with you all, as I know there are already a lot of vegan frenchy recipes out there. At first I considered “thickening” the batter with a starch (i.e. flour) of some kind, but then I really just wanted to keep it healthy and natural. And so, I went with chia seeds. I ground mine up to make them less visible in the final product (for those eaters of yours who inspect every bite and ask, “What’s in this?” before digging in). But this certainly isn’t a necessary step.  The batter is basic. Non-dairy milk, chia seeds, vanilla, agave, cinnamon. For the bread I went with a rustic wheat,and found that heartier breads to better here. The trick to the batter is letting it sit to firm up a bit. Chia seeds typically take 10-15 minutes to activate (longer for pudding), and that’s about how long I let mine rest before dipping the bread in. Go longer for thicker batter, but no too long or it can turn into a pudding (which is not what you want). You’re basically looking for a batter that resembles traditional french toast batter with the egg. Ya dig?  The result? A dreamy, simple, perfectly-sweet french toast that’s completely vegan. So what does it taste like? It’s light Slightly sweet Warm from the cinnamon Tender with a subtle bite Filling Wholesome &amp; Perfect for adding whatever toppings you prefer  Me? I went with coconut whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and a little maple syrup. This would also be lovely with a compote, sliced bananas, peanut or almond butter, or agave. Consider this recipe a basic french toast base, perfect for adding whatever flavors you want to make it your own. I hope you enjoy it!

You guys probably know by now that I’ve been having all sorts of fun with cashews and nutritional yeastlately. They’re a vegan baker’s dream ingredients, yielding both sweet and savory treats with ease! The two together? Unstoppable. This recipe is proof of that fact.  If you’ve ever had a jalapeño popper, you know they make you feel like sinking down into your chair and onto the floor after three. Typically, poppers are stuffed with loads of cream cheese and deep fried. I’m not OK with those two things. In fact, I am protesting those two things right now. Despite replacing them with vegan cheese and baking instead of frying, the flavor and texture is not compromised one bit! The flavor is spot-on, and the gluten-free tortilla crumb topping brings these babies to the next level. Like I said, it’s party time.  This recipe is simple in that it requires 10 ingredients total! And a bonus? It comes together in 30 minutes. Easy party favors for the win.  What do they taste like? Kind of amazing.

0,Healthy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes 2.0  Sometimes, a recipe is worth revisiting. This, my friends, is one of them.  This may look like an insignificant – albeit delicious – stack of pancakes to you. But to me it looks like beginnings. Chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes was the first recipe I ever posted on Minimalist Baker. I knew it was a good recipe, I personally loved it, but I had no idea it would be so well loved by all of you.   Since initially sharing the recipe nearly two years ago, I’ve been wanting to recreate it to make some improvements. I wanted it to be not only vegan, but also gluten-free. And I wanted it to require just 1 bowl. Less mess, more people who can enjoy it. Worthwhile improvements if you ask me.  So, I went to work and kind of perfected the thing. I don’t know how many times I’ve made this recipe in my life, but it just keeps getting better. And now I can confidently say it’s perfected. Vegan, gluten free, 1 bowl chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes. Friends, say hello to the only pancake recipe you’ll ever need.   To keep these gluten free I replaced the whole wheat flour with a mix of my favorite basic gluten free flour blend (which I always keep on hand for GF recipes) and almond meal. I love how this swap helped the pancakes not only cook through a bit better, but also achieve better overall texture.   You’re gonna love these new-and-improved cakes. They are: Super moist Hearty Filling Not too sweet Studded with melty chocolate chips Super satisfying &amp; JUST like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie (without actually being a cookie)  I used to get up early on Saturday mornings, run a few miles, and then come home to a fat stack of banana pancakes that were quite similar to these bad boys. Now that I’ve re-discovered this fool-proof, now-perfected version, it has me wanting to re-establish that tradition all over again. Here’s to spring, to new traditions, and to oatmeal cookie pancakes. Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookie-pancakes-2-0/
0,Simple Vegan Chocolate Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Vegan Chocolate Cake  Four years ago this month,John and I were just kids planning our wedding. We decided to give up sweets during our engagement to feel our best on our wedding day, and to more fully enjoy our dessert bar and wedding cake. The big day finally arrived. We had been so good, not even having an ounce of sweets aside from honey and the occasional after-dinner mint. And you better believe we pigged out at the reception. I was in sweet tooth heaven.  Like most, our honeymoon was a time of sheer indulgence so when we got settled back into “real life” we hit the reset button on our diet. Sweets were out the door again. That was, until we attended the wedding of some close friends in Portland where I met the chocolate cake that perhaps changed my life.  Yes, big words for a cake. I’d resigned to give desserts up indefinitely.But then we show up at this wedding and it’s absolutely charming and the food is delicious and the ambience is perfect and the music is a local bluegrass band…and all at once they bring out this giant chocolate cake. I wrangled our entire table into a discussion over whether or not this cake was worth breaking my fast for. Unanimously, we agreed yes. I took one bite into this luxurious, velvety, rich chocolate cake, and amidst so many layers of mousse, cake and ganache my mind couldn’t comprehend what my taste buds were experiencing. Was it worth it? Without a doubt, yes.  These days my sweet tooth still wins once in a while, but I keep it to the occasional indulgence. A donut here, a cookie there, almost always something on the healthier side of the spectrum. But especially in the last 6 months, always dairy free.And so, it was a given that I had to make my dream chocolate cake vegan style. Friends, I’ve done just that. As the title suggests, this cake is made in 1 bowl in under 1 hour! You can even make your buttercream frosting in the same bowl you used for the cake. Simplicity at its finest.  The ingredients are fairly simple and considerably “healthier” than most chocolate cakes. Coconut oil replaces vegetable or canola Oil is reduced with the addition of applesauce Cane sugar replaces granulated sugar And the only (vegan) “butter” is in the (vegan) “buttercream” frosting  So, what does it taste like? Just like chocolate cake should! It’s: Tender Fluffy Chocolaty Sweet Moist Decadent Generously frosted &amp; Perfect with a glass of almond milk  If you’re like me, chocolate cake (or any cake, for that matter) deserves a giant scoop of ice cream beside it. Melty ice cream and a thick slice of heavily-frosted cake – does it get any better than that? But for the modest cake eater, a glass of almond milk is really all you need to wash down this vegan chocolate dream. Enjoy!  Speaking of almond milk, this recipe marks the first of several recipes we’ll be sharing over the next few months featuring Blue Diamond Almond Breeze! I’ve been using Almond Breeze for years and am thrilled to bring you guys some tasty recipes featuring a product I adore so much.

0,Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Double Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies  Once I’d crafted the ultimate5-Ingredient Vegan GF Cookie, you knew I had to play around with it. Plus, since then I’ve also discoveredDIY Peanut Butter Chips. Hello? Combining the two was a total given. This recipe starts in the food processor and finishes in a mixing bowl so you don’t lose the texture of the oats or the baking chips. Altogether it’s about a 30 minute recipe that makes very little mess (a.k.a. my kind of recipe).  These guys get their peanut butter kick from two sources: 1) Peanut butter that’s added into the batter 2) Peanut butter chips that are baked right alongside the chocolate chips The double PB combo makes my heart swoon, and the chocolate chips make the perfect flavor complement.  The cookies bake up tender and hearty with the perfect combo of salty-sweet. And because they’re naturally sweetened they’re really quite “healthy” enough to enjoy as a post-workout snack or after-meal dessert. In a pinch, I wouldn’t scoff at the idea of having a couple for breakfast. But coming from the girl who loves a goodFriday donut. A note about the PB baking chips: They are 100% natural, so they don’t keep their form as well as traditional baking chips, which get extra help from a variety of additives. As you can see, you’ll get a few little holes during the baking process, but the flavor is 100% spot on! If that’s the “trade-off” for natural peanut butter chips, count me in!  Hope you try these little guys! Make a big batch and throw them in the freezer. They’re like a little granola bar bite on the go, and the perfect healthier treat when your sweet tooth strikes. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/double-peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/
0,Vegan Green Chili Mac n Cheese | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Green Chili Mac ‘n’ Cheese  I’m sure we all have horror stories of the mac n cheese of our yesteryear. For me it was almost always boxed, but in the rare chance that it wasn’t, it was certainly made with that processed block of horror known as Velveeta (*shiver). This is not that kind of mac n cheese. This is unprocessed, wholesome, dairy-free goodness for those of us who still crave a bit of our childhood favorites without all the junk.  Don’t be intimidated by vegan mac n cheese. I was a little skeptical at first because my initial attempts at cashew sauces were unsuccessful. But I’ve learned a few tricks here and there (how long to soak, how long to blend, what spices/seasonings to add) and I’m now a HUGE fan. It’s unbelievable how a jar of soaked cashews can turn into rich sauces, luxurious ice creams and bonafide cheesy goodness. Plus, this particular recipe requires just 10 ingredients (minus the tortilla chips) and 30 minutes! It doesn’t get any easier than that.  This sauce is infused with plenty of flavor thanks to cumin, chili powder and green chilies. Half of the chilies go into the sauce, while the other half get stirred into the final product. The result is oh-so dreamy.   Once you stir the sauce with the noodles and the green chilies, it’s time for a little crunch. I toasted up some tortilla chips until golden brown then sprinkled them on top for another layer of flavor and texture. I was in love. Swoon. You’re going to love this mac n cheese. It’s: Creamy Luxurious Savory Super Cheesy Velvety Perfectly spiced from the green chilies Mega satisfying &amp; Altogether dreamy Oh, and by the way, each serving has 19 grams of protein! WHAT?!!  I personally think you could serve this to a non-vegan and they would totally dig it. They may be able to tell it’s not “true mac n cheese,” but it’s so creamy and flavorful and satisfying that they’ll have to be won over. This makes enough for 4, or 3 very generously, so invite a few friends and take them to vegan cheese heaven. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-green-chili-mac-n-cheese/
0,1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread  Three bananas. One Bowl. Zero gluten. Let’s do this. You may remember my recipe for gluten free banana bread with butternut squash. It’s one of my favorites of all time. Yes, all time. But I couldn’t help but strip it down to the absolute essentials and take it back to classic banana bread land. Friends, behold: 1-Bowl Gluten-Free Banana Bread.  The ingredients for this scrumptious, hearty bread begin with three overripe bananas. Then come essentials you likely alreadyhave on hand, such as eggs (or chia/flax eggs), vanilla and coconut oil. To sweeten things up a bit more I relied on a mix of honey, cane and brown sugar for a variance of flavor and texture. Then comes the gluten-free goodness: a mix of gluten free oats, almond meal and my favorite gluten-free flour blend (which can be subbed out with just about any gluten-free blend). This recipe is forgiving in that the type of GF blend you use doesn’t really matter as much since there’s two other dry ingredient components evening things out. And of course, if you’re not gluten free just sub whole wheat pastry or all purpose for the blend.  45 minutes to 1 hour in the oven and this baby is ready for the taking.  I could hardly wait to slice in, but patience is key here. You need to wait a good hour before cutting into this baby, else it will crumble and fall apart. That’s what you don’t want.  This is what you do want. A hearty loaf that holds its shape and converts even the most suspicious of eaters into gluten-free banana bread lovers. Hubba hubba.  This bread is: Hearty Perfectly moist Loaded with banana flavor Just sweet enough Spotted with oats and almond meal Slightly nutty Incredibly satisfying &amp; Altogether dreamy Trust me, you’re gonna love this bread.

0,Vegan Zucchini Gratin | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Zucchini Gratin  When you hear the word ‘gratin,’ what do you think?Cheesy, breadcrumb-laden goodness made of 10% vegetables and 90% butter? Yeah, me too. That’s why my taste buds are usually drawn to this comforting dish but my stomach is turned away. However, I’ve been thinking of a way to vegan-ize gratin while keeping it simple, natural, flavorful, and gluten-free. No easy task, but I think I’ve cracked the code. The magic starts with vegan parmesan cheese. Have you tried it? Dairy-free and vegan friends, if you haven’t you are simply missing out on fairy dust GOLD. Trust me, I have loved parmesan for years. I used to put it on my eggs at breakfast, my soup at lunch, and my potatoes and salads at dinner. Don’t get me started on how much I put on my pizza. I adore its salty, slightly dry goodness on anything and everything, and have a discerning tongue for how it should taste. Considering this, I had low expectations for how this vegan version would perform.  This – 4 ingredient wonder bomb – actually tastes like parmesan and acts like it in cooking, too! While it won’t melt into pasta sauces and other hot dishes, it will absolutely toast up and get a nice color. And the most important part, the taste is spot on. If you haven’t tried vegan parm, get some in your life. I adapted this version in this recipe fromVeggieful. Go there for a video demo of how to make the stuff.  One last note, nutritional yeast is a wonder food if you haven’t already heard. It’s high in folic acid, contains 9 grams of protein per 2 Tablespoons – that’s more than an egg! – , contains 3 grams of fiber per serving, and boasts an entire day’s worth of Vitamin B-12 (crucial for red blood cell production) in just 1 Tablespoon. I mean, c’mon. And it tastes like cheese? I mean… So even if you aren’t vegan or dairy free, you should consider incorporating even a little bit of nutritional yeast into your daily diet.  Once you have your parm ready, move onto your veggies. I opted for yellow and zucchini squash as a base and asparagus for accent because it’s just so beautiful (and cheap!) this time of year. Oh asparagus, I could paint you you’re so pretty.  The other veggie in the mix is onion, which I sauteed to make a nice savory “crust” or base for the asparagus and zucchini to nestle on. This replaces the need for breadcrumbs, puff pastry or pie crust which some veggie tarts require, keeping things light, natural and veggie-focused just the way my body likes it.  Once the onions are sauteed, simply toss your veggies in a bit of olive oil and arrange them in a pretty pattern on top. It doesn’t have to be perfect. In fact, it shouldn’t be. Just put them in a pattern that makes you happy.  Then, the fun part. Top that baby with loads of vegan parm. I mean LOADS. Do your thang girl.  Then bake bake bake until golden brown and toasty. You guys are gonna love this dish. It’s: Light Flavorful Packed with veggies Entirely guilt-free Perfectly ‘cheesy’ Super satisfying &amp; Lovely for spring and summer In my opinion, it’s just what we need to get us past the last of these icky winter days and into warmer weather. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-zucchini-gratin/
0,Vegan Chai Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chai Ginger Ice Cream Sandwiches  As if I had a choice…  Last week I made Vegan Chai Ice Cream and fell in love. The creamy, spicy-sweet goodness that is this cashew-based dessert has made me a vegan ice cream belieber. I’m never going back. While I could’ve just eaten the entire batch as is, I had a sneaking suspicion it could somehow be elevated. Fate would have it that John asked me that same day whether or not we had any ice cream sandwiches on the site. The short answer was: yes. Yes, we do. However, there could always be more, right?   What pairs well with chai? My mind immediately went to these gluten-free vegan ginger cookies I shared over Christmas. When made into circles instead of cutout shapes, they tend to be a little more tender and easy to work with. Plus, hello! Ginger cookies + chai ice cream? Match made in heaven!   I intentionally under-baked the cookies just a tad so they would be extra soft and tender when biting into, especially when frozen. It worked wonders for the texture! However, if you’re into a crispier bite, bake them another 1-2 minutes. Either way, the flavor will be amazing.   Friends, I am SO stinking excited about how these turned out! They’re: Creamy Slightly spicy Sweet Tender Perfectly ginger-y Beautifully infused with molasses flavor Spot-on chai tastiness Super satisfying &amp; Kind of perfect I take that back. Absolutely perfect.   And when you bite in?! Oh man! The cookie texture is tender and moist and the ice cream melts perfectly – super velvety and creamy. Plus, the chai-ginger combination is to die for. You must try these babies! And if you do, tag#minimalistbakeronInstagram! I’d love to see!

0,Vegan Key Lime Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Key Lime Pies  While doing some research for this recipe, I learned so much about key lime piea la the one and only Martha Stewart. For instance, I discovered where key lime pies originated, what true key limes look and taste like, how sailors used to suck on limes to fend off scurvy, and how to store key limes for year-round use. Oh, Martha? Is there anything you DON’T know? #teachmeyourways   The thing is, I couldn’t find key limes anywhere in Kansas City! (BOOOO). So I subbed regular limes and you can, too. The only remaining ingredients are: cashews agave nectar coconut milk + oil graham crackers vegan butter That’s it! This is 7-ingredient vegan dessert perfection. And to keep it gluten free, simply sub gluten free cookies OR use a walnut-date crust, such as the one I used for my Simple Vegan Cheesecakes. Next time, I think I’ll go that route to mix things up (plus, it really can’t be beat).   The only real pre-prep you have to do is soak cashews for 4 hours or overnight. The rest takes place in the food processor and blender, starting with the crust.  The crust is simply 1 sleeve of graham crackers and 1/4 cup melted vegan butter (I use Earth Balance). Simply pulse the two together in a food processor and then press into muffin liners (or make a large pie and use a glass pie dish). Then use a small glass or the back of a spoon to press down and get a uniform top. Lastly, bake for 10 minutes to brown.    Once you blend your filling until creamy and smooth it’s onto the crust and then into freezer. These don’t take but a couple hours to set up so the wrappers peel away easily for serving.    Oh man, these turned out so good and have me aching for spring. They’re: Creamy Tart Sweet Cold Satisfying Slightly crisp from the graham cracker crust &amp; A perfect light dessert  You can either eat these straight from the freezer, or let them set out for 10-15 minutes to soften, which I preferred. Then they taste like true key lime pie! You’d never guess they were dairy- and egg-free. Enjoy!     ",https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-vegan-key-lime-pies/
0,Vegan Chai Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chai Ice Cream  I got addicted to chai in college when I discovered that a local coffee shop near my university served my favorite brand of spiced chai for $1.50. And it was a large chai latte, too! Somehow now chai tea lattes cost around $4 on average, so I rarely get them. It’s just principle. I’m all for treating yourself, but when you can make the same thing at home for half the price, I can rarely bring myself to do it! Nonetheless, my love affair with chai began and it really never stopped. Chai-infused things are just lovely. And moving into spring I’m already getting into ice cream mode. Not dairy ice cream, vegan ice cream! My body can’t handle the cream and whole milk versions anymore (waaaaaaaa). But thankfully cashews and coconut milk save the day!  This recipe is simple as it requires about 10 ingredients (give or take a spice) and doesn’t require any boiling and chilling, which saves you time. The preparation happens before you ever start by simply chilling your ice cream maker and soaking your cashews to get them blend-able and creamy.  From there the chai flavor is added with a concentrated brewed chai tea and dry chai tea spices.  The traditional spices in chai are cinnamon, ginger, clove, cardamom and black pepper. If you don’t have all of these on hand, just use what you have and let the chai tea compensate the rest of the flavor. And if you don’t have chai tea packets or loose leaf on hand, just use a black tea and add a touch more of each spice. Hopefully one way or the other you’ll be able to pull off that deep spicy chai flavor.   Exciting news! I attempted my first recipe video and am excited to share it with you guys! Let me know what you think. Q: Do you like recipe videos? Do you find them helpful? Would you like to see more of them on Minimalist Baker? I had a blast putting it together and look forward to developing that skill to make our recipes come to life.  Once you add all your ingredients to your blender, just blend until creamy and smooth. Then transfer directly into an ice cream maker and churn until thick and creamy – about 45 minutes. Scoop into a freezer safe container and freeze until firm. Then scoop, scoop away!  Oh, I was SO pleased with how this turned out! It’s Thick Creamy Sweet Luxuriously &amp; Perfectly chai-spiced  The best part? It tastes so creamy and rich that you’d never guess there wasn’t an ounce of cream or whole milk inside. Vegan recipes for the win! Enjoy.      ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-chai-ice-cream/
0,Raspberry Chipotle Black Bean Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raspberry Chipotle Black Bean Dip  A few years ago some friends of ours took John and me on a tour of Manhattan. Not Manhattan the Big Apple. The little apple. Yes, Kansas has a Little Apple and it’s in the middle of nowhere and it happens to be quite charming. Besides having the some of the most crazed, insane fans in all of college sports, it has the most charming little boutiques, cafe and coffee shops – perfect for a day’s worth of exploring. If you’re ever there you must do three things…  1. Go to Varsity Donuts for some of the best donuts you’ll EVER have. 2. Go to Radina’s for a true college-town coffee shop experience. 3. Go to So Long Saloon and order the raspberry chipotle bean dip. It is to die for. In fact, it was one of the primary reasons we went to Manhattan in the first place! Our friends bragged on it so much and insisted we go to this packed bar in the middle of downtown and try this dip. One bite in, I understood the obsession. This dip may sound a little wacky – black beans, cream cheese and raspberry chipotle sauce? But odd as it may sound, it is out of this world delicious.  The awesome thing about this recipe? It comes together in about 30 minutes and it’s gluten-free and vegan optional. I made it vegan for my dairy-free friends (myself included), but you certainly don’t have to. Plus, it serves a crowd. If you’re having company or watching the big game or hosting a dinner party, this is the perfect thing to serve. It’s filling and scoop-able and delicious piping hot or room temperature – the perfect kind of dip for grazing over the course of an event.  The preparation is also quite simple. Saute red onion and garlic, add it to cream cheese and stir. Heat your black beans with a touch of spices and salt. Put your cream cheese in the center of a serving dish or skillet, top with raspberry chipotle sauce (like Bronco Bob’s found at World Market), then top with grated pepperjack cheese. Broil till bubbly then eat! The whole process takes about 30 minutes and leftovers keep and reheat well.  So what does it taste like? Savory Sweet Creamy Hot Not too spicy Hearty Filling Addictive &amp; Perfect on chips Trust me, you’re gonna love this dip.  You can either serve it as is after cooking or swirl it around to meld the flavors. I only did so slightly for visual appeal, but you can also just use a chip to scoop and swirl as you please. This is my homage to the original, but it’s not as good as the one you’ll find at So Long Saloon! So if you ever find yourself in Manhattan, Kansas, you know what to do. Enjoy!

0,Ginger Tea Latte | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Ginger Latte  We love Colorado. Always have. John and my families both vacationed there when we were growing up, and we honeymooned in Breckenridge for two weeks after our wedding in 2010. The whole state has a special place in our hearts. Two years ago we made a trip to visit friends and get our mountain fix, and we ended up at a little coffee and tea shop in Fort Collins that I was initially underwhelmed by but immediately bowled over with affection after trying one sip of their creamy ginger latte. Friends, it was love.  Ever since then, I’ve had a love affair with ginger. Not only is it insanely good for you, it adds the most amazing flavor to dishes like including soups, cookies and even cocktails. I’ve tried with half-hearted effort to recreate the ginger dream latte they served at this particular tea house, but with no success. In fact, a few weeks ago John came into the kitchen and smelled ginger and asked what I was making. “Ginger tea.” “How much ginger are you using?” “Like 10 pieces.” “For ONE CUP?I think you only need like three, for a group of 10.” “Oh…”  OK, OK, so he was right. I’d seen a recipe on Pinterest but didn’t actually read it (go figure), so I ended up with super concentrated ginger tea with zero sweetness and creaminess. That was it; I had to remedy the problem. A proper ginger latte WAS happening.  First step: Make ginger syrup. It’s super easy, you just measure 1 part sugar and 1 part water and bring it to a simmer in a saucepan. Then add sliced ginger and let it simmer away for 45 minutes. The result is a sweet, punchy ginger syrup that you can add to cocktails, lattes, and atop baked goods for a gingery sweet glaze.    The only thing left to do is heat up your almond milk and whisk in the syrup. This recipe is a starting place for a ginger latte, that doesn’t actually include “tea.” If you have ginger tea on hand, steep it in your hot almond milk first, and then add the ginger syrup for sweetness and even more ginger kick. This would send you straight to ginger latte heaven.  What’s it taste like? I was smitten at first sip. It’s: Creamy Soothing Not too sweet Perfectly gingery &amp; perfect for an afternoon reprieve, or lazy weekend mornings whilst reading, writing, or whatever your weekend activities might include.  I have been cutting back on caffeine for various reasons, but still love the idea of a hot drink in the morning. So I’ve been enjoying one alongside breakfast when I’m craving something warm and comforting. This latte certainly does the trick. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/3-ingredient-ginger-latte/
0,Vegan Peanut Butter Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"DIY Peanut Butter Chips  By now you know I have a mild obsession with peanut butter. But this takes it to a whole new level. I’ve found a way to make peanut butter a melt-in-your-mouth baking chip! Three high fives for this much-needed discovery.  It’s a given, but the magic starts with peanut butter. Then for sweetness and texture we add agave nectar and powdered sugar. And lastly, to thin it out and help it firm up and keep a “chip” shape, melted coconut oil.  Mixy, mixy mixy time, then pour baby pour.   Next? Pop it in the freezer – the longer the better. But impatient minds will be happy to know that I tested it at 30 minutes and, although it was more prone to softening while cutting, it did work! You’re basically just looking for a very firm sheet that can be easily cut and broken into chips.   Now, these chips arenotlike regular baking chips, which contain preservatives and additives to help them keep their pure shape when baking. These will soften up a bit more during baking. But the flavor is there 100%. Trust me, I have a cookie recipe featuring these bad boys coming up soon that showcases their peanut buttery glory.  Another difference? You’ve gotta keep these in the freezer to help them stay fresh and keep their shape. “Boo hoo, that’s a bummer,” you say. Well, I say the benefit of this fragile handling and care is that you get vegan, gluten-free baking chips that are made from four simple ingredients and are additive- and preservative-free! That’s a pretty fair trade-off, no?  So what can you add these chips to? I’m glad you asked… Cakes Cookies Quick breads Muffins Ice creams Sundaes Waffles Pancakes You name it, these will do the trick! Have fun, friends!

People and furniture included.  For starters, I’ve enjoyed mine on a banana, toast, pancakes, and straight outta the jar. Straight up delicious. I am already highly anticipating spreading it on a waffle. The way it’s bound to settle into the waffle squares is making my mind spin, hamster-in-a-wheel style. I also suspect it would make an excellent addition tochocolate muffins and cupcakes. Basically, anything that’s edible put this spread on it and go to peanut butter town.

OK, maybe that’s not ALL you need to know. I can’t talk that little – you know that much by now. These pot pies come just in time for extra-chilly winter days. They’re warm, rich, comforting, entirely vegan and made completely from scratch. I’m so into these right now.  The filling comes together in one pot in about 20 minutes. While it’s simmering away, thickening into liquid gold, make a batch of my Best Damn Vegan Biscuits! Alternatively, top them with pie crust or store bought biscuits. I just like making mine myself because there’s truly nothing better. You’ll have leftover biscuits but that just means you can have biscuits with breakfast tomorrow. Is that so bad? (answer: no. No, it’s not.)  Total prep time on these guys is about 35 minutes and they bake up in about 15. I’ve deemed them the “1-hour vegan pot pie” even though they probably require a little less. But with clean up time included that’s probably more accurate. Besides, you’ll be super impressed with yourself when they’re done in 45 minutes and you feel like a pot pie wizard. You’re welcome.  One bite in and I knew these were spot on.

You may or may not already be familiar with green smoothies. But here are two things you may not know about them: 1. You can throw your greens in the freezer so you always have dark leafy, nutrient-packed greens on hand. Look at that! So fancy! And it doesn’t affect the flavor or texture of your smoothie one bit. 2. You can craft a smoothie that completely hides the taste and texture of kale. And not a little kale, like handfuls. Let’s do this!  This smoothie is the same but different than my 5 Ingredient Detox Smoothie. They both contain frozen bananas, frozen berries and fruit juice. But this one hides kale like a boss and is packed with hemp seeds. “Hey Sheila, why does that matter?” You’re probably thinking… Well, Sheila and Rhonda, let me tell you. It matters because hemp seeds contain loads of fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals and all 20 of the essential amino acids, including the 9 essential ones. And all of that supports just about every part of your body function. You need hemp seeds in your life, period.  Smoothies are easy. I don’t need to tell you that!

I eat one nearly every day. So it’s no surprise that my favorite pie is banana cream. But, since I’ve cut out mostly all dairy from my diet I haven’t attempted to make or even take a bite of a banana cream pie in years (*cue: tears). Friends, I was due.  This banana cream pie requires just 10 ingredients including the crust! Dates + walnuts = crust Filling = cashews, coconut milk, coconut oil, banana, vanilla, agave nectar, lemon juice, salt  I was once skeptical of cashew-based desserts, but ever since trying these 7 Ingredient Vegan Cheesecakes my mind has been forever changed. The filling soaked cashews yield is just so creamy, silky sweet and luxurious you can’t beat it. You’d never guess it was dairy free. It doesn’t taste suspect at all.Especially when topped with coconut whipped cream, which is my best friend these days.   The preparation is simple, too. Just process your dates and walnuts in a food processor and press into a springform pan, or a round pan or baking dish lined with plastic wrap if you don’t have a springform (hand raised). Freeze and forget. Then blend your filling ingredients until creamy and smooth. (You don’t need a Vitamix for this – just a nice quality blender. I use a Kitchenaid.) Pour over the crust, cover and freeze to set. Done and done. The result? Something straight out of heaven.   This pie is perfection. It’s: Creamy Luxurious Sweet Decadent Perfectly infused with banana Super satisfying &amp; A dream when topped with coconut whipped cream, caramel, and crushed peanuts. I mean, I can’t make this stuff up. It’s just that good.   Make this pie! You will love it…if you love bananas, that is. My sister balks at them. And she used to be allergic to peanut butter! I have no idea how we’re related. I guess our shared affection for desserts and coffee redeems it all. However, if bananas really aren’t your thing, fret not. Sub strawberries! Or mangoes!

0,Vegan Mashed Potatoes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Damn Vegan Mashed Potatoes  Remember a few weeks back when I made coconut cream pie french toast? Well, this recipe came from the same place of inspiration: while I was working out watching the Food Network. Apparently, it’s my zen place.  Tyler Florence was making a version of mashed potatoes I’d never seen before. He cooked the potatoes in whole milk and cream to produce the creamiest, must luxurious mashed potatoes I’d ever laid eyes on. Obviously, I can’t do dairy because it hates me. So I wanted to try a vegan version to see if it worked sans cream.  Turns out, if you cook potatoes in unsweetened plain almond milk, it really just makes them kind of mealy and they taste like almond milk. Yick. Back to the drawing board. NOW YOU KNOW. Another few attempts at the best damn vegan mashers yielded massive success. It turns out, you don’t need to cook them in anything other than plain old water. It’s the type of potatoes and mix-ins that make all the difference.  These mashers require 6 simple ingredients: Yukon gold potatoes Vegan butter Roasted garlic (hubba. hubba) Sea Salt Black Pepper &amp; Chives The result is super creamy, luxurious mashed potatoes with a sweet garlic tone, plenty of S+P, and an herbaceous, light touch from the chives. Give me a spoon, I’m going in.  You will love these taters. They’re: Thick Fluffy Creamy Buttery Airy light Garlicky Herbaceous &amp; Altogether satisfying  These mashed potatoes are perfection with a little additional vegan butter, salt, pepper and chives. But they would definitely stand up to and pair well with my 6-Ingredient Mushroom Gravy.

0,Ginger Beer Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Ginger Beer Margaritas   Friends, I have been eagerly awaiting the day that I could share this recipe with you. It is hands down the recipe I am most excited about this month! No, really! Even more than all the desserts (even the cheesecakes) I’ve shared, I am absolutely smitten with this drink! You simply must make it. Promise me this.  This drink is simple – as always – with flavors that were seemingly meant for each other: Ginger beer, simple syrup, fresh lime juice, tequila, and salt for your rim (a must).  When it comes to your tequila, go for something quality. As in, not Jose Cuervo Gold, which I was recently informed is not really tequila (I’ve been lied to all these years and it hurts.) We went with a brand called Altos (no affiliation or partnership, just pure adoration) and we love it. Just remember, the key to picking a good tequila is: Make sure it’s made with 100% agave. Then you’ll know it’s higher quality and made with the good stuff. This will ultimately affect the quality of your drinks.  This recipe is so easy to make. Just lime your rim with lime juice and salt and then add all of your ingredients with ice to a large glass or cocktail shaker and stir (as to not erupt your ginger beer – lesson learned). Then pour over more ice, garnish with lime, and stir.  What does it taste like? Seriously the best margarita I’ve ever had. And I’ve had a lot of margaritas!(Don’t worry mom, I’m not a drunk – I swear. I just like ritas.) These guys are: Perfectly sweet Tangy from the lime Crisp from the ginger &amp;…Really just perfect. John and I both loved that they showcase the tequila well and don’t overpower it. And they go perfect with any and all Mexican dishes, which is great because we eat some form of tacos at least twice a week. Hello fajitaville and nacho soup.  Simply put: Make these margaritas. You will love them – I have no doubt. Unless, that is, you don’t like ginger beer. And if that’s the case, GET OFF MY INTERNETZ. (Kidding but not kidding, ok kidding, but really? Who are you?) Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-ginger-beer-margaritas/
0,Peanut Butter Pretzel Truffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peanut Butter Pretzel Truffles  It’s no secret that peanut butter, pretzel and chocolate go together. They were practically separated at birth, if you think about it. I say, let’s fix that. WHO’S WITH ME?!   This dessert is perfect for Valentine’s Day because it’s salty-sweet, melts in your mouth and is highly shareable. What more could you ask for in a romantic holiday dessert? But even if V-Day is not romantic for you… Say, you hate all members of the opposite sex (we’ve been there) You’re having a bad hair day Your coworker’s desk is LINED with flowers (ugh, Rhonda) Your fingernail paint is chipping Your V-Day plans include watching re-runs of Friends with Ben and Jerry WHO CARES? Valentine’s Day isn’t about that anyway. It’s about love, and that includes loving yourself. I suggest you start loving yourself by making these 6-ingredient peanut butter pretzel truffles and enjoying a few by the fire. (Or your faux Netflix fire…Gah, I love technology.)   The center of these guys is simple: Pretzels, peanut butter, dates and almonds. That’s it!  And the outside is all chocolate. Choose dark or milk or bittersweet; it’s really your call. I usually opt for bittersweet when making candy because it cooperates best when melted and pairs well with salty flavors.  The only thing left is to sprinkle these with a few more crushed pretzels, or little pretzel pieces. If you’re about leaving something to the imagination, go for crushed. (It’s like “What’s inside? I DON’T KNOW but the suspense is killing me!) If you hate mystery like me, go for the broken pieces. (It’s like “Yeah, there’s pretzels in there. YERR GONNA WANT THAT.”) Ya dig?  You’re gonna love these truffles. They’re: Peanut buttery Studded with pretzels Swimming in chocolate Salty Sweet Shareable Decadent Satisfying &amp; Borderline addictive  Happy candy making, friends! As always, if you make these little gems take a photo and put it onInstagram! Then tag me @minimalistbaker (and don’t be a private user or I can’t see it, and that usually ruins my day). I’d love to see your candy making in action! Hugz.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-peanut-butter-pretzel-truffles/
0,Easy Vegan Cheesecake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Vegan Cheesecakes  Friends, few times have I been more excited to share a recipe with you as I am today. This recipe has been taste-tested and approved by 6 of my closest foodie friends and heartily approved. And they weren’t even vegan! I even like these better than real cheesecakes, which I can no longer stomach with my dairy intolerance. Crisis, averted. These 7 ingredient beauties begin with a 2-ingredient crust! Dates and raw walnuts (or almonds) – that’s all you need. Whirl and set aside.  Next up, the 5-ingredient filling: Soaked cashews, coconut milk, coconut oil, lemon juice and agave nectar. So good, so creamy, so insanely delicious you’ll want to drink it with a straw.  This is where the fun begins: you get to pick your own flavor! Of course, you could leave them as is. They’re extremely delicious plain. But, to perk them up a bit I created three varieties: blueberry, bourbon caramel, and peanut butter. My favorite being peanut butter (as if you expected anything less).  Instead of baking these cheesecakes you simply pop them in the freezer to set. To make removing them from the pan a breeze, I simply cut out strips of parchment paper and made little tabs so I could just pop them right out. Worked like a charm! If you don’t have parchment, just slide a butter knife along the sides to pop them out. Easy, simple removal either way (no special equipment or springform pans required).   If you’ve ever been suspicious of cashew-based vegan desserts, don’t be!I can wholeheartedly attest that these are some of the best desserts I’ve ever had! No seriously.I can’t even begin to tell you how insanely delicious these guys are – and I’m a cheesecake snob!  They’re: Creamy Perfectly sweet Slightly tart Luscious Sexy Smooth Insanely satisfying &amp; Perfect topped with coconut whipped cream OK, this is beginning to sound like a Victoria’s Secret ad. You catch my drift. Just make, these, cheesecakes!     ",https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-vegan-cheesecakes/
0,Simple Vegan Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Gluten-Free Cookies  Sometimes you want a cookie. But sometimes you want that cookie to be healthy. And sometimes you don’t want that cookie to annihilate your kitchen with flour and dishes. Guess what, these are those cookies! And they so tassssttttyyyyy.  Yep, 5 ingredients. That’s all you need. Forget the eggs, the flax, the sugar, the flour, the butter. All you need is dates, a banana, oats, almond meal and almond butter. Chocolate chips? Those are extra and optional. But who are we kidding? YERR gonna want those.   Another perk of these gems? The batter comes together in a food processor! Of course, if you don’t have a food processor you could still make these in a regular mixing bowl, but it’s way more fun to whirl it around with a blade until pulverized. It’s the baker’s equivalent of a punching bag for stress. Let it out, girl. I feel your pain…    After about 15 minutes in the oven these babes are ready for your mouth.They taste similar in flavor to our Vegan Gluten Free Everything Breakfast Cookies but require one-third of the ingredients and far less time. That’s my kinda (healthy) cookie. These guys are: Hearty Slightly chewy Wholesome Not overly sweet Studded with chocolate (if you dare) &amp; Highly shareable Or not. Or just eat them all yourself. I won’t tell.  These cookies are so healthy they could actually be breakfast or a post-workout snack. I enjoyed mine during afternoon slumps and after dinner when I was craving something sweet (aka always). But, enjoy them as you wish. It’s your cookie, friend. Go wild.

0,Simple Vegan Hot Chocolate | minimalist baker recipes,"5-Minute Vegan Hot Cocoa You guys, it’s cold. I mean, seriously cold. We may have narrowly escaped the polar vortex but I’m still feeling its aftermath. Most days John and I hunker down inside next to space heaters. But when I just can’t kick a chill – or am having a serious chocolate craving – I make my favorite 5 minute (or less) vegan hot cocoa. It’s such a simple recipe it’s almost a non-recipe. But I asked Facebook fans if they’d be interested and the answer was a resounding ‘yes.’ So, here it is – my go-to homemade hot chocolate that’s way better (and healthier) than any packaged or boxed mix you’ll find. It starts with simple ingredients: Unsweetened vanilla or plain almond milk (or make your own!) Unsweetened cocoa powder Dairy-free semisweet or dark chocolate Raw sugar or stevia You can make this in the microwave in a big mug – I use my big yellow cereal mug that I’ve had since high school and have carried with me like an adult blankie. Or, if you’re not into the microwave or would rather go old school, simply add ingredients to a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and whisk away. Creamy perfection is just 5 minutes away. Next I like to add a little extract. I know everyone usually recommends adding vanilla to “bring out the flavor of the chocolate” or something like that. But I’ve been on a chocolate peppermint kick for the last few months, so I put in a drop or two of peppermint extract and it sends my tastebuds straight to heaven. The last element? Coconut whipped cream. I mean, hubba hubba. Also, WHY NOT? It really does put the finishing touch on the cocoa and gives it that luscious, creamy effect I just adore. And there you have it! My 5-Minute Vegan Hot Cocoa. I hope you make it a lot this winter to keep warm. And if you do, Instagram me a photo – it’s kind of my favorite. Then we can be warm together via internet.

0,Caramel Almond Butter Cups | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Bourbon Caramel Almond Butter Cups  Growing up, my sister and I were both heavily involved in sports. Softball, basketball, track, soccer, volleyball…we did it all. In at least 30% of those sports, our dad was our coach. I guess we liked to keep it in the family – still not sure if that was a good idea or not. I’ll get back to you on that one. When I was still a bit younger and learning the ropes in basketball, I would go to my sister’s rec league games on weekends and watch the older kids play. My dad would coach – naturally – and I got to sit in the stands next to my mom who was feverishly – and poorly – filming the action, missing whole segments of the game when she’d get worked up over plays, put down the camera and start yelling at the players and referees. My mom is 5’2″ and weighs a buck ten. She’s pint sized and she means business. It’s hilarious and adorable and terrifying all at the same time. Trust me, I was there. Obviously, these games were the best. Don’t worry, I’m getting to the candy part…  Between quarters I’d swindle a few bucks out of my mom and mosey down to the concession stand – one of the main reasons I loved sports at that age. Play a game, get a snow cone. I’m in. My sugar of choice at the time was either Snicker’s or Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Snickers were more of a grocery store check out line operation (please mom? please?). But Reese’s? All ball game. There were two, they were salty and sweet, and they achieved the perfect melt in the muggy heat of an old gym filled with sweaty pre-adolescent bodies. Plus, not too much to fill you up so you still have room for nachos and whatnot. I was methodic about my candy even at 6. More bizarre than my selection theory was my method of consumption. I would only take bites when my sister scored a basket or did something “good.” She made a good pass, bite. She made a free-throw, bite. She made a 3-pointer? Two bites. I had my tactics down.  This just proves my storied and colorful history with peanut butter cups. But it wasn’t until adulthood that I fell in love with almond butter. Upon trying my first almond butter cup I was hooked. Not necessarily better than peanut butter (don’t get it twisted), but seriously up there. It was only natural to explore flavor combinations, especially since somebody in this house is obsessed with all-things caramel.  Besides, I needed an excuse to make another batch of my 4-ingredient bourbon caramel sauce. 6 months without that stuff is 7 months too long if you catch my drift.  These cups are pretty straight forward, taking about 15 minutes total to make once you have your caramel sauce ready (add 15 minutes). And though they take a little fancy handwork with tipping, filling and pouring, the effort is undeniably worth it. I mean, look at these things. C’mon.   After a quick chill these guys are ready to go straight into your mouth. I reluctantly shared half of this batch with friends so I wouldn’t immediately engulf the entire recipe all by myself. (Trust me, I would so hide these from John all over the house and sneak bites when he wasn’t looking. At least I’m honest.)  These are the perfect DIY candies for Valentine’s Day and beyond. They’re: Dark chocolatey Almond buttery Sweet Rich Drenched in caramel Offset with a pinch of salt on top Highly gift-able &amp; Sharable In other words, perfection in cup form.  I don’t employ the same consumption methods as I once clung to in my youth. There’s less waiting involved as these cups call for a quick chop in half to let the caramel ooze out, followed by a messy scramble to get in every nibble before the caramel escapes your grasp. It’s like a game – a drippy, delicious candy game. The best kind of game. Enjoy these cups, OK? I mean, there’s no way you possibly wouldn’t. Seriously. It’s science.

Look at the goodness that is these healthy, beet-powered chocolate lava cakes! Valentine’s Day is gonna rock so hard this year, single or not. These lava cakes were initially inspired by a version I tried in Bali last summer. But I have to be honest. The one I tried at a practically 5-star restaurant wasn’t that good! I immediately thought “I can do this better.” And, I did! Vegan and butter-free style. Plus, coconut whipped cream &gt; dairy whipped cream. The ingredients for these cakes are simple: Pureed beets Cocoa Powder Coconut oil Cane sugar Semisweet chocolate Unbleached flour Vanilla A few other basic baking essentials round out the rest of the ingredients.

I discovered perhaps the best small batch vegan banana muffin recipe last year when I fiddled around until perfecting my jumbo muffin for 2 recipe. I mean, those things are bomb. As in, exceptional. The only next option was to quadruple the recipe and bring these muffins to the next level with a CRUMB TOPPING. Yeah, I said it. Muffin enthusiasts know everything is better with a crumb top – it’s fact.  Bring on the crumb topping! Raw sugar, vegan butter, unbleached flour – that’s it! And you have crumbs galore.

0,Coconut Cream Pie French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coconut Cream Pie French Toast The other day I was running on the treadmill in our apartment gym and I flipped on the Food Network – literally the only channel I watch TV for. Lucky for me the show on at the time was all about the best foods featured chefs had ever made. The recipe that immediately caught my eye and got my mind spinning was Paine Perdu – the most decadent, mind-blowing take on french toast ever. It, was, on. I immediately ran upstairs and told John I had a recipe idea. The original recipe was LOADED with dairy in the form of half and half and butter – things I really can’t handle. So I wanted to make version that was just as decadent yet dairy-free. That fastest way to get decadence without dairy fat? COCONUT MILK. Plus, it just so happens that my favorite pie is coconut cream pie, so that flavor application was kind of a given. This french toast starts at night – a step that’s not entirely necessary but recommended. The batter includes: Coconut milk Almond milk Eggs Vanilla Agave nectar &amp; Raw sugar Whisk it all together then toss in your crusty bread (gluten free even!). Get some zzz’s and in the morning you’re ready to bake. Because the slices of french toast are so thick, we first fry them up on both sides to get some color, and then finish them off in the oven to make sure they get cooked all the way through. After 10 or so minutes in the oven they’re just begging to be served and smothered with coconut cream pie toppings.  For starters, coconut whipped cream.  Ooh, baby. Next? MAPLE SYRUP. Last but not least? Toasted coconut flake.  All right, seriously. Now we’re talkin’. This french toast is INSANE. It’s: Slightly crisp on the outside Tender and custard-like in the middle Sweet and decadent Loaded with coconut cream pie flavor &amp; Perfect for feeding a crowd (1 slice per person is plenty) After cooking mine up, I devoured a slice, John had one as well, and the rest went down to some very happy staff at our apartment who received the dish with big eyes and hungry bellies. The verdict? Some of the best french toast EVER, especially if you’re a coconut cream pie fan like me. Enjoy!     ",https://minimalistbaker.com/coconut-cream-pie-french-toast/
0,Patatas Bravas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Patatas Bravas You probably you have that one obnoxious friend who has traveled the world and can’t shut up about it. Well, I fear I’m becoming that person, sharing all of these travel-inspired recipes lately. But that’s certainly not what I’m trying to do! I just can’t help but share the amazing and awesome food I experienced while away from the U.S. There’s a lot of great food out there and I simply think you should know! One such dish being PATATAS BRAVAS. Oh, lordy. I would go BACK to Spain just to have patatas bravas. True story.  It all starts with crispy quartered potatoes. Some versions are fried, I was not about to go there (#terrifiedofgrease). Plus, baked taste just as good if not better than fried. And you can have twice as many since they have half the calories – it’s science.  The thing that makes this dish special is the tomato sauce. Although there many versions out there, some even, including a garlic aioli as a second sauce, I wanted to keep things simple. The sauce itself comes together in about 20 minutes including prep time and requires super basic ingredients: Tomato paste or canned tomatoes Salt Garlic cloves + powder Cayenne Paprika Hot sauce &amp; Onion It’s very similar to the sauce for the simple baked eggs, only more vinegary, spicier, and less chunky. Perfect for pouring atop crispy baked potatoes. #YUM  If you want to keep this dish vegan, stop here. But if you’re up for another layer of flavor, bring on the Parmesan! I highly recommend it, as it’s a simple alternative to making aioli, which requires 5 more ingredients. Last but not least, HERBS! I went with cilantro, but parsley is perhaps more traditional. Besides adding more color, it adds freshness and an earthy flavor that I love.  And there you have it. SIMPLE Patatas Bravas with a kick. This dish is: Spicy Savory One word – POTATOES Perfect for a crowd (tapas anyone?) Customizable Tomato-y Garlicky &amp; Super satisfying Make this a complete meal by adding a runny egg on top (seriously amazing). Otherwise, serve as a traditional Spanish appetizer or “tapas.” We ate these EVERYWHERE when we were in Spain. So good! They’re probably my favorite appetizer of ALL TIME. Sorry chips &amp; salsa, you were good for a little while but…you’ve been replaced. Enjoy!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/simple-patatas-bravas/

I think I’m in love. I’m not sure where this idea originated – probably Martha Stewart herself. But I love it. Not that pasta is super complicated anyway, but to create an even smaller mess and save time is a double upgrade if you ask me. This dish starts with plenty of veggies: Mushrooms, eggplant and fresh parsley. You start by sauteeing your veggies in a big pot or pan and then setting them aside. Next comes the pasta, tomato sauce, garlic, water and seasonings into the SAME POT. Super easy stuff. Then you literally just bring it to a boil, cover it, and let it simmer until the noodles are al dente. All that’s left to do is taste, adjust seasonings, and throw the veggies back on. So simple. So good.  This dish is: Light yet filling Fresh Rich with tomato flavor Full of good-for-you veggies Vegan (and gluten-free optional) &amp; (best of all) EASY Plus, it’s extremely customizable. Use your pasta of choice, sub in your favorite veggies, throw in fresh herbs, roast your garlic, top with cheese – the options are endless. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/one-pot-vegan-pasta/

0,Tom Kha Gai with Butternut Squash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tom Kha Gai Butternut Squash Soup If you ever have the chance to travel, do it. It has been one of the most challenging experiences I’ve ever endured – hello jet lag, language barriers and heavy backpacks – but it was also one of the most fun and educational. Perhaps my favorite element of travel is expanding my horizons, whether it’s observing how other people do life, learning to speak another language or exploring new cuisines. Such cuisines were Thai and Indonesian. Though very simple, straight-forward dishes, they were always fresh, inventive and incredibly flavorful. One example of this? Tom kha gai. Tom kha gai is a broth- and coconut milk-based soup whose primarily flavors are ginger (or galangal), lemongrass and chili. I have a simplified version of it in our upcoming 31 Meals cookbook (to be released any day now!) But I got it in my head to make a version with butternut squash because I imagined the flavors melding together so well. Turns out, they totally do. Tom kha gaitypically features chicken as the primary protein, along with a few mushrooms for more heartiness and texture. But I kept this version vegan friendly and upped the veggie count with an entire roasted butternut squash! Look at that creamy goodness. I could hardly wait to give it a try. Though this soup may be foreign to some, the ingredients are fairly common and easy to attain: Butternut squash Vegetable broth Coconut milk Ginger Lemongrass Shallot Thai chili (or other hot pepper) Mushrooms &amp; fish sauce (optional)  On its own, this soup has TONS of flavor. But the addition of butternut squash makes it even more creamy and luxurious and perfect for slurping down while hunkered down inside during harsh winter weather.Trust me, this is practically all we did last week. Wake up, stay in jammies, hot cocoa, soup, back to bed. And it, was, wonderful. I highly recommend you do the same. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/tom-kha-gai-butternut-squash-soup/
0,Vegan Double Chocolate Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Double Chocolate Beet Muffins When I was in high school my mom used to packed my lunch for me every day before I left for school. I know, I was totally spoiled. More on this fact here and here. But despite having a wholesome, homemade meal as mid-day fuel I always craved just a little something more. You know, something sweet. Something chocolate. Something like, an Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate chocolate muffin. Don’t mind if I do, eat-it-cold-with-my-bare-hands while my friends watch in horror. #truestory But here’s the deal. I don’t even want to know what was in those things. And I’m pretty sure each one had at least 400 calories and loads of fat and sugar. Knowing that now, I avoid them at all costs. But that doesn’t mean I don’t crave a moist, chocolate chocolate chip muffin once in a while. My solution? Make them healthier.  This recipe starts with one seriously healthy ingredient: Beet puree! An entire cup of beet puree – equals out to about two whole beets – goes into a dozen, naturally-sweetened, whole grain muffins that also happen to be vegan. I didn’t even know such deliciousness was possible without butter, sugar and milk.  Despite their intenseappearance, these muffins are actually super simple once you get your beets pureed, requiring just one bowl and 30 minutes to prepare. And the ingredients are simple and wholesome: flaxseed beets agave nectar brown sugar salt &amp; baking soda coconut oil almond milk cocoa powder whole-wheat pastry flour &amp; dairy-free chocolate chips If you have those things on hand, you’re in business. I mean, you’re in SERIOUS business. Look at these beauties!  I was so pleased with how they turned out. They’re: Moist Fudgy Super chocolaty Filling &amp; Altogether satisfying Way better than the muffin of my yesteryear, but with all of the satisfying, chocolaty taste I remember and love. Another perk? Each muffin boasts just 170 calories! I’m not big on counting calories myself – I believe more in intuitive eating. But I couldn’t help but brag about how nutritionally dense yet calorically modest they are! That means you can eat at least 2-3 at any given moment, right? OK good, that’s what I thought. Enjoy these muffins with breakfast, as a snack, or a late-night dessert. I personally chose to share mine with friends – a.k.a. in a safe environment where I wouldn’t inhale half the batch before I realized what just happened. Bake them, share them or keep them for yourself. Whatever you do, justmakethem! You’ll fall in hardcore vegan love with these little guys. Enjoy!

0,Vegan Peanut Butter Mousse | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Mousse Peanut butter is one of my favorite foods. In fact, I think I ate it so much growing up that my body started telling me to slow my consumption. There would be days in college that I’d put peanut butter in my oatmeal at breakfast, peanut butter in my smoothie at lunch, then have a peanut butter and jelly wrap at dinner. Whoops. What can I say! I love this creamy, salty nut butter. So why then, I ask, not make it into a healthy, 3-ingredient mousse so I can put it on everything? That’s what I want to know! The basis of this recipe is simple: Coconut whipped cream + peanut butter + sweetener of choice I went for agave nectar, but you could also use maple syrup, powdered sugar, or stevia for a lighter option. Whip, whip, whip. Then bring on the peanut butter!  This delicious spread doubles as both a stand-alone dessert – peanut butter mousse – as well as a healthier peanut butter frosting. I would put this on brownies, muffins or cupcakes and go to town.Another option? Protein-boosted fruit dip! Put this on a banana and experience instant bliss. Go wild and put it on everything (including drinking chocolate for the win – yeah I said it). Dig in!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/3-ingredient-peanut-butter-mousse/
0,Vegan Tortilla Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Loaded Veggie Nacho Soup Sometimes eating healthy is really hard. You eat well for a while but inevitably begin to miss the familiar, comforting foods that are no longer on your menu.This has happened to me many times over. But, I have a solution, and that’s to get creative; to modify and find ways around restrictions and rules so I can still enjoy my food without ditching my healthy eating habits. The good news ? This soup satisfies both requirements. It has all the taste of the hearty, comforting dishes you love plus all of the nutritional and health benefits and whole foods ingredients your body craves. Plus, it’s easy, vegan and gluten free – a win-win for all parties involved. Originally I set out to make a tortilla soup mixed with a vegan chili. The name didn’t hit me until I was taking my first bites and thought, “Wow, this tastes exactly like nachos!” The crunchy chips on top and all of the traditional nacho toppings had me totally sold. It’s like healthy food and comfort food all wrapped into one. These DIY baked chili cheese fritos are perfection on top of this soup. But you can also just use tortilla chips for a quicker, easier option. What I love about this soup: 1) It comes together in about 30 minutes. 2) Is rich and hearty with the perfect balance of tomato-y thickness and savory broth. 3) And is loaded with veggies: onion, tomato, chilis, fresh salsa, plus fresh avocado and red onion on top. Cilantro would also make a brilliant addition. Dream big, friends, and don’t skimp on toppings. That’s my motto. I think we’ll be seeing a lot of this soup this winter. It’s so perfect for cold weather, plus makes enough to feed you for at least two if not three meals. Make it your own and adjust the heat, toppings and yield to best suit your family. It’s extremely customizable and thoroughly delicious. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/loaded-veggie-nacho-soup/
0,Baked Chili Cheese Fritos | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Chili Cheese Fritos One of my favorite foods growing up was frito chili pie. I know, so not healthy – guilty as charged. But so good! Loads of crunchy, salty fritos topped with hearty chili and handfuls of cheese – so delicious. And no veggies in sight; just the way I liked it back then. Oops. But worry not! Things have changed. I love veggies now. In fact, most nights I request “something with tons of veggies” for dinner. It’s John’s favorite (eye roll). More evidence of my ever-evolving healthy palette is my love for baked things over fried things. Baked chipsare (almost) as good as the real thing. So when I recently re-discovered my love for homemade tortilla chips andtortilla soup via the ever-talented Kate, I couldn’t help but dream to recreate my old favorite: chili cheese fritos. These fritos are so simple and you likely already have all the ingredients on hand. You just need the spices listed above, corn tortillas and a little oil. I also added a pinch of nutritional yeast for a vegan-friendly “cheese” flavor, but it is certainly optional. The best and easiest part, in my opinion? Once baked you just have to find something to bury them under. Like I said, BEST PART EVER. While these chips don’t taste exactly like the original, they are seriously close and way better for you since there’s no frying and zero questionable ingredients involved. Just tortillas, spices and olive oil – straight forward food.Junk food made healthy, indeed. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/baked-chili-cheese-fritos/
0,Chocolate Almond Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Thick DIY Chocolate Almond Milk Perhaps the best part of driver’s ed my freshman summer of high school – besides the invaluable lessons I gained in conducting myself on the road, of course – was my instructor, Wendell. Not only did he have the innate ability to grunt instructions without sounding cross, he loved donuts. A man after my own heart. Wendell took a poll one day and we all agreed that we should steer our school’s light blue driver’s ed van toward the Lamar’s Donuts one town over and load up with sugar, fat and dairy be before we set off for hours of driving practice. As a high schooler, my absolute favorite thing to get at a donut shop was a maple long john (or two) and a jug of full fat chocolate milk. Oh glory. I know,the two worst things I could possibly pick for myself nutritionally speaking. But, I was 15 years old, rail thin and going to school in the SUMMER to learn how to drive. CUT ME SOME SLACK.  The moral of the story: My love for neither maple long johns nor super thick chocolate milk has faded. But what has changed is my body’s apparent inability to process dairy anymore. So, while I can still indulge in a donut every once in a while, the milk thing has got to change. Enter: Homemade Super Thick Chocolate Almond Milk. It’s dairy free and soooooo delicious! This milk is simple to make, requiring just 3 ingredients and supplies you likely have on hand. Ingredients are: Almonds Filtered water Dairy-free dark chocolate Equipment includes a decent-quality blender and a very thin towel, cheesecloth or nut milk bag. You can try with a fine mesh strainer but I didn’t have much luck (too pulpy and I’m not much for pulp in my milk). The best part is, you can make this in one afternoon if you’re in a hurry.Thanks to the genius of Kathy, we now know you can actually soak your almonds in boiling water, which makes them ready to blend into milk in about an hour! But, for those of us who aren’t in a time crunch, overnight soaking is the way to go. The almonds are able to take their time and soak to get all plump and doubled in size for blending. This almond milk is just what I was hoping for: Thick Creamy Not too sweet Super chocolaty &amp; Totally delicious with a donut (or anything) I hope enjoy this milk! I’ve nearly finished mine off and am already dreaming up other variations. Votes on flavor ideas are welcome below.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/super-thick-diy-chocolate-almond-milk/
0,Raspberry Bourbon Smash | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Winter Bourbon Smash  Friends! 2013 is almost over. Do you have New Year’s plans yet? Whether you’re going out or staying in, we have the perfect simple drink for you: A winter bourbon smash.  This drink has quite the history. We especially loved this excerpt: “The smash is an open-ended cocktail, freely variable and seasonally flexible. There must be ice…There should be fruit in season, though you may use it simply as a garnish. There should be a spirit base…You may want to water your smash down a little or add a spritz of seltzer. At its heart, the smash is a wonderfully forgiving and flexible drink, made for…using what’s on hand and for smashing it all together over ice for pure sipping bliss.” Now that we’re all learned on this beautiful, simple cocktail, let’s get to mixin’.  It all starts with raspberry jam. We called this a winter smash since traditionally a smash should contain a seasonal fruit. Being that it’s frigid outside and fresh fruit isn’t exactly plentiful, a jam is the perfect solution. For flavor we went with raspberry, but you could really use any jam or preserve you have on hand. A perfect pairing to raspberry is orange, which we used as both a garnish and juice to add a brightness to this cocktail.    Two things I love about this drink: 1) It has a quenchable thickness thanks to the preserves. 2) It highlights the bourbon beautifully. I wouldn’t consider myself a huge bourbon fan (unless it’s in caramel). But the more I try it in drinks like this, the more I love it. It has less of a punch than vodka and tequila and a distinct flavor that’s absolutely delicious when well mixed.  This drink is my new favorite. It’s: Fruity Not too sweet Slightly creamy Bright with citrus Not too strong &amp; So easy to make. Make it this New Year’s Eve to bring in 2014 right. This is definitely what we’ll be cheersing to at midnight. Enjoy!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/winter-bourbon-smash/
0,St. Germain Spritzers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"St. Germain Pomegranate Spritzers  Besides my birthday, Christmas is the climax of my year. I wait in heavy anticipation for 12 months for the day that arrives in what seems like a flash and before I know it, it’s over. And all the excitement surrounding it evaporates in seconds. There’s nothing quite like the holiday season and I hate knowing I won’t taste it again until next year. Thus, it’s a given that New Year’s takes a back seat to my joyous, beloved Christmas. Part of the reason? There are few traditions surrounding New Year’s, including zero presents and very few cookies (BOO). But, I’ve recognized lately that big changes and even life-altering discussions have surrounded our past several New Year’s celebrations, and it’s caused me to reconsider my affection for it. It’s no Christmas but it causes me to reflect on a year gone by and what lies ahead. And that calls for celebrating. Libations anyone?  During our recent tour de Europe, we found ourselves in Barcelona at perhaps my favorite coffee shop in the world – Caravelle. A recommendation of the Oh, Ladycakes herself, we were immediately drawn to the coffee and food Caravelle had to offer. But I couldn’t help but wonder what their drink special was all about: a St. Germain Spritzer? I’d never even heard of St. Germain before, but it intrigued me. So we did a little research and discovered it’s of French origin and derived from elderberry flowers. An artisanal liqueur, St. Germain has a delicate, floral flavor that mixes incredibly well with champagne, club soda and citrus.  We ended up ordering the special, then another, then we convinced our friends to order one, too. Practically the minute we got back home we went searching for a bottle of St. Germain and have since been experimenting with (and thoroughly enjoying) this incredibly unique and delicious liqueur.  It turns out, St. Germain, sparkling white wine and pomegranate juice are meant to be together. This spritzer is comprised of a Brut sparkling white wine, a shot of St. Germain, pomegranate juice and arils and a dash of club soda. So simple, so delicious.  We fell in love with this cocktail and found it perfect for special celebrations, especially New Year’s Eve.It’s: Light Fruity Floral Bubbly Not too sweet &amp; Highly customizable. When you have bubbly and St. Germain in a glass, it’s really hard to go wrong. Cheers, friends!  P.S. What are you doing for New Year’s?We’re either going to a party with people we don’t know who apparently just bought two cats (John and I are both allergic), or doing absolutely nothing. Either way it’s a win-win. Happy (early) New Year!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/st-germain-pomegranate-spritzers/
0,Vegan Detox Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Detox Smoothie  I’m guessing right about now you’re having some serious cookie regret. I only say that because that’s usually where I’m at Christmas week. So much indulgence, so many stretchy pants. How about we offset some of that decadence with a healthy, 5 ingredient superfood smoothie? That’s what I thought we could all use…  This smoothie starts with a base of frozen berries. I can’t bear going without berries all winter long, so snagging frozen ones at the store is the perfect solution. Plus, they make a healthy and delicious base for smoothies.  Next we add in: Spinach Flaxseed Fruit juice &amp; A frozen banana So creamy. So delicious.  Recently, I’ve also been digging silken tofu in my smoothies for added protein instead of almond or peanut butter, which I often do in this smoothie. But I count it as optional since it’s already seriously creamy and nutritious as is.  Oh mama. So much detoxifying goodness in the form of: Fiber Antioxidants Omega 3 fatty acids Vitamin C Folic acid Phytonutrients etc., etc. Does the body (seriously) good. Cheers! (P.S. You should totally tell me the best gift you got this Christmas. I seriously want to know.)  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-detox-smoothie/
0,Vegan Cinnamon Roll Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cinnamon Roll Pancakes   I had a bit of a debacle as to what to post Christmas week since everyone is so busy running around, wrapping gifts, traveling to see family and likely already have their holiday menus all planned out. But, I figured everybody surelyhas room for one more breakfast recipe in their back pocket with a week of lazy mornings surely on the horizon. Am I right?  For me, it was clearly between pancakes or cinnamon rolls. So, I put it to vote with aquestionon Instagram and got a TON of responses. You guys are seriously awesome. One, because you care about what we post. And two, because you inspired me to dream up an entirely new recipe I hadn’t even thought of yet. About half way through the comments somebody suggested cinnamon roll pancakes and it’s like they read my mind! I was thinking the exact same thing in that very moment. The perfect marriage of two perfect breakfast foods. It was on. (P.S. for those who voted cinnamon rolls, don’t worry! I’m already plotting two recipes that I think you’ll be quite pleased with so sit tight and eat pancakes in the meantime.)  I have never attempted cinnamon roll pancakes but I know they’ve been done before by a lot of bloggers, so I wanted to do something different and if possible, vegan. Turns out, both were entirely possible. To get that quintessential cinnamon roll flavor I started with a yeasted, whole grain batter since nearly all cinnamon rolls have that amazing earthy, bakers-essential yeast flavor. I was so stoked to see that it rose to double in size just like I was hoping with all of its bubbly, yeasty goodness. Then, I scooped out a bit of the batter, added in brown sugar, cinnamon and a little melted butter and I had my cinnamon swirl in hand.  So easy and so delicious! Look how fluffy and decadent they look cooking up.   These cinnamon roll pancakes are legit and only require 8 ingredients! Almond milk Vegan butter Whole-wheat pastry flour Cinnamon Sugar &amp; brown sugar Salt Yeast That’s it! You likely already have all those things on hand. Plus, they produce a surprisingly small mess of dishes and come together start to finish in under 2 hours. Not bad for pancakes that cram all of the flavor of homemade, slow-prepared cinnamon rolls into every fluffy bite.  While I don’t think a glaze is necessary, I couldn’t bare trying them without one. I went with my favorite easy glaze that always yields plenty of leftovers: Powdered sugar, almond milk and melted vegan butter (recipe below). So good once it hits your lips.  These pancakes really do taste like cinnamon rolls! Fluffy Not too sweet Packed with cinnamon, brown sugar flavor Seriously filling &amp; Surprisingly healthy Plus, they feed a crowd and can be easily doubled and tripled, with one batch making at least 8 large pancakes. (Two should be plenty for one person.)  Make these for your family and friends this week! I think they’ll love them. Plus, I have a feeling they’ll make your holiday gatherings a little bit sweeter and more memorable. Enjoy!     ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-cinnamon-roll-pancakes/
0,Vegan Peppermint Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peppermint Black Bean Brownies  Happy (almost) Christmas week! I feel we’ve nearly reached the pinnacle of holiday spirit. For me, it peaks around the 20th and by Christmas Eve I’ve calmed back down to normal person emotions. But until then, I will buy gifts and wrap presents and bake Christmas-y treats like these 1-bowl fudgy peppermint brownies like a mad woman. They’re so good you’d never guess they were vegan, gluten-free, and loaded with good-for-you nutrients. Yipeee!  The batter is so simple. It all happens in ONE BOWL – your food processor! This ensures the the black beans are completely pulverized and undetectable in the finished product.  Look at that fudgy goodness. It’s honestly so good you could just eat it straight, which I have a number of times. Because there’s no eggs, no regret. It’s science.   Baking these guys in a muffin tin allows every brownie to achieve that perfect, slightly-firm edge and ooey-gooey center. But, I’ve had plenty of people bake these in pans with similar success. So really, it’s your call! I just prefer the bites because I like miniature things. There, I said it.  These brownies get their peppermint two ways: 1) Peppermint extract inside the brownies, and 2) A dusting of crushed candy canes on top. Chocolate and mint are kind of meant to be together, and these brownies only solidify that fact.  These really are the perfect, healthier GF and V dessert for all your holiday gatherings this coming week (and even New Year’s parties!). They are super moist and fudgy in the center, firm but not too crisp on the edges, and loaded with intense chocolate flavor from both cocoa powder and chocolate chips.   You and your friends will LOVE these brownies. Trust me. I took these down to the staff in our new apartment building and I believe the phrase “inhaled them” was the word most used when I returned later to drop off more treats. Total win (and no black beans detected). Score and score.  And if you happen to have some on hand, coconut whipped cream makes thee BEST frosting for these little guys! Enjoy!

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Men | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Gingerbread Men  I put out a little “SOS” of sorts on Facebook last week asking you guys what type of baked treats you’d like to see on the blog before Christmas. Though I got a lot of replies the most common theme was gingerbread, and specifically to make it gluten-free and vegan. When you talk, I listen! I got to work that same day and perfected a recipe by morning. Friends, I present to you both gluten-free AND vegan gingerbread men!   This batter is seriously decadent looking, no? But it’s deceptive as it actually has plenty of wholesome gluten-free grains like buckwheat, brown rice, and oat flour. It also includes one flax egg and a healthy heaping of molasses, which we all know is good for the soul. A few other basic ingredients and we have 1-bowl magic on our hands. Next? Chill, roll, and stamp – my favorite part.   These little guys take a little tender care in the stamping process but once you get them on the tray you’re home free. And the good news is, if you’d rather not mess with cutting them into shapes, you can just roll them into little balls and bake them into some of the BEST, crispy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-insider ginger cookies I’ve ever had. No joke!   Look at that stack of gingerbread goodness. These guys are: Crispy on the edges Tender and slightly chewy in the center Packed with ginger, cinnamon and molasses flavor Seriously addictive &amp; Begging to be frosted. I can fix that…   For my frosting I went with a simple mix of powdered sugar, melted vegan butter, and a dash of almond milk. This is the perfect and most simple frosting for these little dudes. OK, I lied. Stamping them out is my SECOND favorite step. Icing them is my first.   I hope you enjoy these cookies! Make them for friends, for yourself, or with the little kiddos in your life. They will have a ball dotting on buttons and faces and tiny gingerbread man shoes. Maybe more fun than you (but I doubt it).   Once they’re all dressed, package them up and send them to far away friends or ones just across the street. These would also be adorable individually wrapped in cellophane and tied onto presents. Just sayin’. Your family would be seriously impressed.  And before I go, can I just say that making them into little rounds is my preferred way to go because although they aren’t as adorable, they taste like gingerbread MAGIC IN THE MOUTH. Get you some.

0,Vegan Frosting Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Coconut Macadamia Frosting  A dozen or so days out of the year I find it completely acceptable to slather buttercream frosting on anything and everything in sight and go to party town. Birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, promotions, finding a really good sale at Target. Go ahead, girl. Celebrate. But then for the other five353 days out of the year we need something a little lighter, right? A little, less-than-1,000-fat-grams-per-serving. I’m not saying frosting is bad. In fact, if you say that, I say shun you, non believer. I’m just saying, we could use a healthier one in our arsenal once in a while for when the healthy mood strikes us. And for those times, I have just the solution.   Guess what?! Shredded coconut and macadamia nuts whirled together make frosting! A creamy, coconut-y, vanilla frosting that goes perfect on sugar cookies, pancakes, waffles, angel food cake and anything else for that matter.And there’s no butter and very little sugar involved.   The buttery, creamy goodness of macadamia nuts + the rich flavor of coconut is kind of perfect in this frosting. If you are a coconut fan you will LOVE this recipe. I colored mine for frosting sugar cookies with, but you could just as easily leave it plain and dress it up with colored sprinkles or sugar.  The important part: What’s it taste like? Buttery Not too sweet Infused with vanilla Smooth with just a little texture from the coconut flake &amp; Perfect for piping!

0,Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Super Soft Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies  There are two foods I can eat to no virtually no end: anything dark chocolate and peanut butter,and sugar cookies. Not just any sugar cookies; my aunt Patti’s famous, soft sugar cookies that she’s brought to Christmas every year for as long as I remember. Sometime around November I go ahead and resolve that I’m going to fall off the wagon on these cookies. But because I only fall off the food wagon a few 10 times a year, I figure it’s totally worth it. After all, they’re sugar cookies! I mean, c’mon. Live a little.  Here’s the thing about sugar cookies. They contain lots and lots of butter, sugar and gluten, the last one being a major offender for a growing number of people. But I say you can still have cookies, you just have to get creative and replace the gluten with something else, like a baking blend? Yes, like a gluten-free baking blend. Exactly.  After trying my baking blend/pancake mix in GF chocolate chip cookies and having such wild success, I knew sugar cookies were my next target. And I’m happy to report that it totally worked! Again! This mix produced some of the softest, fluffiest, most flavorful sugar cookies I’ve ever had – no joke! Who says you need gluten after all…?   These cookies are little pillows of Christmas-y goodness. Tender Sweet Fluffy + soft Infused with vanilla Perfect on their own Or topped with sprinkles. &amp; Not at all grainy or tough.

And they are SO delicious and soft and addictive that you’d NEVER guess in a million years they were gluten-free. Hooray!   When I had such great success with the gluten-free mix for pancakes, I immediately wondered if it would work in cookies. Well, it turns out IT DOES – really, really well.

0,Gluten-Free Pancake Mix | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Pancake Mix  Pancakes have always been one of my favorite foods. There’s something about a fluffy stack of pancakes covered in butter and syrup that makes getting up just a little bit easier. And though my preferences for pancakes have evolved over the years to include much healthier versions, I can always go back to enjoy a classic stack with no mix-ins or crazy flavors. Though John and I are not required to eat gluten-free, a number of our friends are, which has not only caused us to be more considerate of their needs but also more aware of how gluten sneaks its way into so many of the foods we enjoy – including pancakes.  I was inspired to create a gluten-free pancake mix not only for gluten-free eaters, but also for those who hope to experiment with gluten-free eating or are just looking for a more wholesome, homemade everyday pancake mix. Though I’m not a gluten-free cooking expert (yet), I do know one thing about baking gluten-free: mixing/blending flours is a must. It provides diversity and complexity, which (hopefully) provides the final product with a density and texture that is similar to that of gluten-containing goods. For this reason I went with a wholesome mix of brown and white rice flours, buckwheat flour, GF oat flour, cornmeal, and a pinch of xanthan gum for binding.The rest is pretty basic stuff: sugar, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.    You guys, the result was amazing and exactly the GF mix I was hoping for. Just add roughly: 1 1/2 cups milk or buttermilk 1 egg 1 Tbsp melted butter or oil And voila! You have some seriously fluffy, delicious (and hearty) pancakes on your hands.  What do they taste like? Fluffy, not too sweet and perfect under a drizzle of melted butter and honey or syrup. John and I both agreed that you wouldn’t be able to guess they were gluten-free if you didn’t know otherwise. That counts as a massive success in my book. Make this for yourself for quick, weekday breakfasts, or as a Christmas gift for gluten-free eaters in your life. They’ll love you forever – promise. This recipe is also customizable! Add any spices you prefer to the mix, such as cinnamon, cardamom, or nutmeg. And if you can’t get your hands on any of the flours I list, play around with the other GF flours to compensate. It should be fairly forgiving. As well, boost their flavor by adding mashed banana, blueberries, peanut butter or chocolate chips to the batter before cooking. And lastly, don’t forget the butter and syrup (or honey, as I prefer). Enjoy!  NOTE: Recipe updated January 8, 2016 to include: Added note about raw buckwheat flour, not toasted buckwheat flour. I buy raw buckwheat groats from the store and grind them into flour! ",https://minimalistbaker.com/gluten-free-pancake-mix/
0,Vegan Peppermint Drinking Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peppermint Drinking Chocolate  Oh hey! It’s Christmastime – my absolute favorite time of year. Why? For one, I get to make and eat tons of goodies this month, like chocolate and peppermint things! Swoon.   My first peppermint-chocolate creation was inspired by our time in Zurich, Switzerland last fall, where chocolate is one of their prized specialties. People form lines around chocolate shops there and it’s all because it’s made fresh daily by artisans who have made chocolate their life and craft. It’s no joking around. Besides eating truffles and bars, another very Swiss way to consume chocolate is by drinking it. I can totally get on board with this concept.  Drinking chocolate differs from hot cocoa in that it’s much thicker and usually contains melted chocolate rather than cocoa powder. This makes it richer, creamier and all-the-more decadent. It’s normally treated as more of an indulgent dessert than a daily drink, though I wouldn’t judge if you opted for the latter.  For this recipe you need: Coconut milk Dark chocolate Peppermint extract Raw/Turbinado sugar Coconut whipped creamisn’t necessary but highly, highly recommended. I mean, come on. You’re already going to party town. Why not go all the way? A little sprinkle of crushed peppermint doesn’t hurt, either…  This drinking chocolate is my new obsession! It is thick, slightly coconutty, insanely creamy, intensely chocolaty, and balanced with a hint of peppermint. This recipe makes a descent sized batch, which you could serve to a small group. Since I apparently don’t have friends or I don’t like to share, I’ve hoarded mine all to myself and have been reheating little portions after dinner for a little virgin nightcap. But I can almost guarantee that Baileys or Kahlua would be delightful in this drink.

I mean, peanut butter, jelly and graham crackers are kind of meant to be together.  Even better news? They travel well and somehow get better the second day! I love it when that happens.

0,Butternut Squash Potato Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butternut Squash Potato Salad  Hi, my name’s Dana and I’m a butternut squash addict? I admitted my new obsession with this gorgeous winter fruit in last week’s post for Warm Butternut Squash Salad. Well I couldn’t keep my paws off of it once I discovered how versatile and truly quick and easy it is to prepare. Once you shimmy the skin off it’s literally 15 minutes in the oven ’til go time. That’s my kind of meal.  I find the texture of squash to work well in salads because it gets kind of tender yet holds its form when tossed. And because I have loved potato salad since I was a fat baby on my mom’s knee I knew I had to try butternut squash version to add to my Thanksgiving table. Dressed with a light and creamy yogurt-based dressing, it was everything I had hoped for: Light, crunchy, and filling with a delicate balance of sweet and savory flavors.  The ingredients of this salad are simple: Red skin potatoes Butternut squash Radishes &amp; Green onion And with a simple dressing of Greek yogurt and mayo (or vegan alternatives), grainy mustard, vinegar, and standard spices, it’s the simplest of side dishes to prepare.  Hands on prep time is less than 30 minutes and the whole thing comes together in about 1 hour. Plus, it’s a one bowl operation. Mix up the dressing, dump in the rest and toss! Easy and SO flavorful and satisfying. The crunch factor is perfect with the radishes and green onion. And the potato and squash remain tender and complement each other well married under the creamy dressing.  Make this recipe for Thanksgiving, Christmas and beyond. It’s such a versatile dish that travels well and requires little prep time. Plus, as ingredients come in and out of season you can sub them in place of each other and make something entirely new. You could even add a little protein of your choice to make this a complete meal: chickpeas, chicken, hard boiled eggs? Whatever you prefer. Enjoy!

0,Apple Cinnamon Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Apple Cinnamon Waffles  If you love warm, baked cinnamon apples and maple syrup-doused waffles, this is the recipe for you. If you don’t like these things, in the words of Uncle Rico, you can leave.  Joking aside, these waffles are some of my faves. Warm, cinnamon-brown sugar apples mixed into a whole grain-oat waffle batter – it’s practically perfection. The good news? They’re super easy to make.   This is a 1-bowl recipe, which means fewer dishes! I love that. Plus, it comes together in about 30 minutes. It doesn’t get much better than that for some seriously sophisticated waffles.  The primary ingredients you’ll need for this recipe are: Apples Brown Sugar Cinnamon Flaxseed Whole Wheat Flour Oats Applesauce or Pumpkin Puree &amp; Maple Syrup A few other pantry staples and you’re in business.  These waffles are so delicious I ate two right away! John can attest. I love that they’re tender on the inside, yet a little crisp on the edges, studded with warm cinnamon apples in every bite, and perfect under a drizzle of maple syrup.  These are simple enough to make during the week before getting off to work and school, yet special enough to serve up for breakfast or brunch ona lazy Sunday morning. Versatile, simple and so delicious when frozen and re-heated in the toaster. That’s my kind of waffle. Enjoy!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-apple-cinnamon-waffles/
0,Roasted Butternut Squash Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Warm Roasted Butternut Squash Salad  For some reason I’ve never been a big squash person. In fact, the first time I even tried or touched a butternut squash was last fall when I showed up early for a party and my friend put me to work peeling and cubing one (which, by the way, is not an easy thing to do for a squash novice). But this year I was determined to get into the kitchen and get familiar this gorgeous winter fruit. And I’m happy to report that I’ve created three amazing recipes, this colorful and simple salad being the first.  First you want to start by removing the skin and cubing your squash. If you have a heavy-duty peeler, use that. Otherwise, stick withthis method. It’s tricky at first since the skin is tough, but after my second try, I was nearly a pro.  To get the squash tender and flavorful, simply toss it in olive oil and a little salt and pepper and roast. Not for long either! It only takes about 15-20 minutes in a 400-degree F (204 C) oven.  The next element of this salad is pecans, which can easily be prepared while the squash is roasting. Simply toast raw pecans in a skillet, remove and add olive oil and brown sugar, and then add the pecans back in a toss! It’s the easiest and most fool-proof method to perfect toasty, caramelized pecans every time. The only thing left to do after that is add in some spinach, cranberries and toss it all together with a little more olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper. This salad is so simple and delicious, perfect for fall gatherings or even as a healthy and filling take-along lunch for work or school since it doesn’t need to be refrigerated. In fact, it’s best when served warm. I suspect you’ll love the mix of textures and flavors here, especially how the balsamic adds a nice acidity to balance the sweetness. Enjoy!

0,Caramelized Pear Steel-Cut Oats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Brown Sugar Pear Steel-Cut Oats  Pears are kind of gorgeous, no? They’re also delicious. In fact, they were the only fruit besides bananas that I would eat when I was a kid. Thankfully I’ve evolved since then to love almost every other fruit in existence. Fruit: It’s like nature’s candy.   While pears are delicious all on their own, they’re even better browned in a little butter and brown sugar. This makes them tender and gives them a nice sweet, caramelized flavor.  Then come the oats! So simple and hearty and delicious and absolutely perfect for cold temps. Personally, few things sound more satisfying to me than a warm bowl of steel cut oats on chilly fall or winter morning. Topped with a layer of brown sugar pears and pecans? Perfection.   Not only is this recipe simple and quick – requiring just 20 minutes from start to finish – it’s also customizable. If you’re not into steel cut oats, sub another grain like rolled oats, quinoa or millet. And if pears aren’t your thing, sub apples or even blueberries. Make this bowl your own and enjoy it often this winter. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/brown-sugar-pear-steel-cut-oats/
0,Vegan No-Bake Pumpkin Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy No-Bake Pumpkin Pie  Oh how I love pumpkin pie. My favorite variety is a family recipe that I shared last yeararound this time. But this year, I wanted to make a from-scratch vegan version that required as little effort as possible. I’m happy to report the experiment was a total success.  Though this recipe requires more than 10 ingredients and 1 bowl, hands on prep time is only 30 minutes and there’s no baking involved, making this recipe quite simple and totally worth the effort. It starts with a no-bake, completely natural, vegan, and gluten-free crust made from dates, nuts, oats, and pumpkin pie spice.  Next comes the filling: A creamy vegan pumpkin pudding that comes together in about 10 minutes (plus chilling time). The result is a from-scratch pudding that’s thick, pumpkin-y and perfectly sweet. So gorgeous.  NOTE: While making this pie I accidentally discovered a secret way to make perfect coconut whipped cream even if you get a bad can! It happened when I thought I’d grabbed the powdered sugar from my newly organized mason jar pantry when I’d actually grabbed the tapioca flour. It couldn’t have been more perfect timing because the can of coconut milk I’d bought was a dud, meaning it was still liquidy and unseparated after chilling. Humph. I was ready to count it a loss when I accidentally added the tapioca flour and it thickened right up! I couldn’t believe it – literally thee best and thickest coconut whipped cream I’d ever made. And it stayed thick and luxurious in the fridge for days after. Plus, because tapioca flour is so fine it didn’t affect the flavor or texture one bit! I added in a little vanilla extract and powered sugar and ‘voila’ – perfection! I did try this method with a can that produced plenty of thick cream after my initial test and it didn’t seem to help as much. So I would only add tapioca flour in the case that your coconut milk is still liquidy after chilling as more of a “last chance” method of saving it. More coconut whip tips: – Make sure your coconut milk is fresh – I find the longer it’s set on the shelf the less likely it is to whip. – Give cans a shake test in the store. If it does a lot of sloshing around it probably isn’t a good can.  Look at those peaks! Hubba hubba. Where should I put all that whipped cream?Oh yeah, ON MY PIE.  This pie is an absolute dream. The crust is perfectly sweet and super moist, yet holds its shape. The filling is like pumpkin heaven on a spoon. And the coconut whipped cream MAKES it. Make this pie this holiday season. Your family will love it! Also, stay tuned for an even simpler version coming soon. Hooray!    ",https://minimalistbaker.com/creamy-no-bake-pumpkin-pie/
0,"Grilled Almond Butter, Chocolate, Pomegranate Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes","Grilled Almond Butter, Dark Chocolate, &amp; Pomegranate Sandwich  If you could just give me a moment…alone with this sandwich, I’d appreciate it.Hubba hubba.  I am a loyal fan of grilled sandwiches, especially of the cheese variety. But as I’ve shared before, I have to watch my dairy intake. You can’t keep a girl from her bread though, so to the drawing board I went. That’s about the time this beauty came to mind. Friends, I give you the grilled almond butter, dark chocolate, and pomegranate sandwich. Your taste buds will thank me.  The method for making this sandwich is as simple as it gets.Simply butter two slices of crusty bread, slather some almond butter inside and stack it high with quality dark chocolate and plenty of pomegranate arils. The result is an incredibly flavorful, satisfying sandwich that’s healthy enough to justify for lunch, yet decadent enough to call dessert.  This is kind of my dream sandwich. Technically I suppose banana would replace the pomegranate, but I am capable of branching out sometimes. Besides, pomegranates are a tasty and healthy way to branch out and they go perfectly with almond butter and dark chocolate.  I’m in love with this recipe! Almond butter and dark chocolate create a creamy, melty decadent filling while pomegranate arils burst with sweet, slightly tart flavor in every bite. And that perfectly-buttered, crispy crust? Don’t even get me started. Make this sandwich!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/grilled-almond-butter-dark-chocolate-pomegranate-sandwich/
0,Persian Eggplant Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Eggplant &amp; Caramelized Onion Dip  Once upon a time I thought hummus and pita was the only known dip alternative to chips and salsa. But then John’s aunt Nadia took us to an authentic Persian restaurant in San Diego where I was introduced to the wonder that is Persian Eggplant dip, also known as kashkeh bademjoon or borani. To keep things simple, let’s just call it Creamy Eggplant and Caramelized Onion Dip, and know that it is my absolute new favorite dip on the planet.  As always, this dip is simple; even more simple – and healthy – in fact, than traditional versions. You don’t have to fry or even roast the whole eggplant, which douses it in grease and takes time. Instead, you roast it skin on in a little bit of olive oil and the skin peels right off. Easy, easy.  While your eggplant is roasting away in the oven, take a giant onion and some garlic and do the best thing you could possibly do to: Caramelize. Something about soft, sweet, caramelized onions turn me into a ravenous food hog. I think I could’ve just eaten the whole pan and been in complete bliss. But, thankfully I resisted the temptation.  Once your eggplant and onion are ready just transfer them to a mixing bowl and give the whole thing a mash, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. The last step is to add a dollop of Greek yogurt, which makes it uber creamy. This obviously makes it not vegan, so you could sub tahini instead. But really this dip is so creamy as is you’d hardly miss it if you went without. Top your dip with a few remaining spoonfuls of caramelized onion and you’re done! Persian eggplant dip in a cinch at home. And can I just tell you how insanely delicious this dip is? It’s: Creamy Sweet Savory Loaded with smokey eggplant and caramelized onion Altogether satisfying Light &amp; Healthy What more could you ask for in a dip?  This dip is traditionally served with some form of pita bread, which I highly recommend. This dip and bread were meant to be together. You may wonder why I’m posting this dip in the middle of pumpkin and apple season. Well, the answer is it would be the perfect appetizer to take along to Thanksgiving dinners and holiday social gathers as it can be made vegan and gluten free and is absolutely sensational. Even picky eaters will love it. (Not to mention, it would be a lovely sandwich spread the day after with its creamy texture.) Bring on the parties and social gatherings! I know what I’m bringing.

0,Vegan Pumpkin Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Spice Pancakes  A while back a friend from Portland messaged me and asked where in the world the pumpkin pancakes were on our site. GOOD QUESTION. Answer: Here they are! They’re here!  The truth is, I’d been planning on making pumpkin pancakes for a while now I was just waiting till November. (Hi, November!) And as soon as I walked outside recently and needed a coat I knew it was time. Oh I love this time of year, and not just for the pumpkin pancakes.   Can I just admit how much trouble I had with this recipe? I literally tested it 8 times – a new record around here. The problem was I was trying to pack too much pumpkin puree into the batter and it was causing them to be a bit too moist in the middle and not cook all the way through. IS THAT SUCH A CRIME? While we’re onthe topic of admitting shortcomings,I also love too much. Just thought you should know. With all my failures I grew so frustrated I nearly threw in the towel on these guys. But for pumpkin pancakes, I knew must persevere. The final product was pretty sensational and totally worthy of sharing. Phew, that was a close one.  These pancakes are perfection: the perfect balance of fluffy and dense, sweet, spicy, and packed with pumpkin flavor. Plus, they’re easy to make, requiring just 20 minutes and one bowl. Not to mention, no fancy ingredients required – just your fall-time pantry basics like pumpkin, almond milk, spices and maple syrup. Easy peasy and so worth the 20 minute effort.  These beauties are absolutely phenomenal topped with a bit of Earth Balance and maple syrup. I even added a bit more pumpkin pie spice on top for aesthetic effect, but it took them to a new level of delicious – highly recommended. What more can I say about these cakes? Make them this fall! Your mouth will thank me.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-pumpkin-spice-pancakes/
0,Vegan Fajitas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Poblano and Portobello Fajitas  For a brief period of my childhood, my family lived in New Mexico, and you better believe while there we ate our fair share of Mexican food. I was floating down a river of authentic refried beans and slow-cooked carnitas and garden fresh salsas and loving it. My little palette was in foodie heaven and I hardly even realized it. Those were the days. But I don’t live in New Mexico any more. I live in Kansas, which means the Mexican food isn’t quite as authentic or abundant. I may be part Swedish, Irish and German, but I crave a ridiculous amount of south-of-the-border goodness. Lucky for me, John does, too. The solution? Make it myself.  The truth is, we eat some form of Mexican food at least three times a week, whether it’s quick lunches at Chipotle, black bean enchiladas or an impromptu taco bar. We can’t get enough of the stuff. But one meal I hadn’t tried at home yet was fajitas – one of my favorite meals to order at restaurants. Something about the sizzling peppers and huge platter it comes out onand the self assembly – over-stuffing to the point of ridiculousness –makes me feel like a queen. A true foodie dream dish if you ask me.  These fajitas remain vegan thanks to bell and poblano peppers and juicy and satisfying portobello mushrooms, sauteed in just a few simple seasonings. They’re no carnitas, but certainly delicious in their own right. I felt full after just two, which is saying a lot for me – a true quantity eater. I suppose the giant spoonfuls of guac didn’t hurt either.  If you aren’t a fan of mushrooms, simply omit them or sub in your favorite meat. For a vegetarian version opt for scrambled eggs or black beans. And to keep these gluten free, simply opt for corn tortillas – I went with flour because that’s traditionally how fajitas are served. Count this recipe as inspiration and proof thatfajitas can be vegan and still totally, insanely delicious. Ole!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/poblano-and-portobello-fajitas/
0,Deep Dish Apple Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Deep Dish Apple Crumble Pie  It’s not apple season until a pie has been made. That or a crisp. But I’ve already made two of those so pie it is!  When apple season comes around it doesn’t seem right not to make a pie. It’s John’s favorite – and probably mine, too. Cherry and pecan don’t have anything on apple. But pumpkin? We’ll get to that later…   This pie was inspired by my love for all-things deep dish (hello simple deep dish pizza!), and my recent discovery of the perfect oat-pecan crumble(which is gluten free). I took this pie over to some friends and didn’t start it until an hour and a half before leaving, so it comes together pretty quick. Another huge perk? It only requires one bowl! I love simple baking.  This pie is pretty decadent – definitely not health food. But if you’re going to indulge in dessert why not make it fruit? The crust is a classic flaky crust that’s a family recipe, the filling is nothing but apple-cinnamon goodness, and the top is the perfect mixture of nutty, oaty, brown sugar goodness. Your friends will thank you for making this pie. Mine did. Proof? It was gone by the evening’s end. Maybe I should’ve named this “5-Hour Apple Pie” – that’s how long it lasts. Enjoy!

0,Vegan Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Savory Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles  You may not know this, but John and I are in Europe right now. Surprise! We pulled a Well Traveled Couple and are off with friends exploring new countries in a foreign land. I couldn’t be more thrilled, a) that I’m actually touring through Europe right now eating pastries and wearing a scarf and b) that I can still bring you delicious eats at the same time. Oh the wonders of the internet. I love my job.  These waffles scream fall with healthy ingredients like pumpkin and cornmeal. I’ve made a sweet version of pumpkin cornbread waffles before, but was craving something a little less on the dessert side and a little more on the entree side. The experiment was a screaming success.  These waffles are super simple, requiring just 30 minutes and 1 bowl.Plus, they’re vegan and you likely already have all the ingredients you need on hand. Pumpkin? Check. Cornmeal? Check. Everything else is basically necessity. How very convenient.  These waffles are crisp and cornbread-like with just a hint of pumpkin flavor. They’re also very customizable when it comes to seasonings and mix-ins. I went with salt and pepper and green onions. But I could also see garlic going really well here, as well as jalapenos, chives and even a handful of your favorite cheese (if you dare). The awesome thing is you don’t have to go the savory route and add an egg on top like I did. You could just as easily slather them with a little butter and maple syrup and go to town. These would also go amazing with sliced avocado or some vegan beer chili! What? Who said that…. Oh yeah, I did. Enjoy-ee.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/savory-pumpkin-cornbread-waffles/
0,Veggie Tofu Stir-Fry | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Tofu That Tastes Good: Stir-Fry  I remember the first time I tried tofu. It was raw in a whole grain wrap along with some mustard and veggies and I honestly couldn’t finish it. And when it comes to food I’m a trooper. I’ll finish just about anything as I hate wasting food. But, tofu did not strike my fancy from the start and it’s never really been my favorite, even in my hardcore vegetarian days. But, that all changed recently during a trip to San Antonio when I ate the best tofu of my life. It was in a veggie stir-fryover coconut brown rice at a restaurant called Green Vegetarian Cuisine. If you’re ever in the area you must stop by and try this dish. Your view of tofu will be forever changed – promise.  Two bites in and I was in heaven. I had to flag the waitress down and ask her how in the world they made the tofu taste so good! I thought it was fried, but it wasn’t. Haaaa-llelujah. The best part? It wasn’t wet or soft or soggy or lacking in flavor at all like all of the tofu I’d tried prior. She rattled off a few instructions and I made a mental note. That same week I hopped in the kitchen and gave it a go myself. It really worked you guys! I love tofu now. It might not be as delicious as Green Vegetarian Cuisine’s version, but it’s very close. And the more I practice the better I’ll get. I have a very good feeling about this.  The basic trick is first drying the tofu, then baking it at a high temperature to brown it and create a tougher texture, and then letting it set out to dry even more. This gives it a “meat-like” texture, if you will, that makes it much more porous to soak up delicious sauces and far more appetizing in the texture department. With this tofu I can’t help but finish it all – it’s too delicious not to!  For this recipe I made a quick and simple stir-fry but once you have the basics down this tofu could be used in just about any recipe you already love. It works extremely well in stir fries because they tend to be very saucy, but I also imagine it would be delicious over salad, in faux-egg salads and even with BBQ sauce. I hope to incorporate it into more of the meals we regularly prepare to see just how versatile it is. But from what I’ve tasted so far, I have very high hopes.  Because it was diced, baked, left out to dry and then stir-fried in the sauce, the tofu soaked up so much flavor, rendering it absolutely irresistible. Try this tofu and let me know what you think! I think even your tofu-hating friends will approve.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/tofu-that-tastes-good-stir-fry/
0,Vegan Pumpkin Currant Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Currant Bread  Ahh, pumpkin bread – one of my favorite fall foods. Yes, as in: It deserves its own food group. WE’RE GOING THERE.   I’ve attempted pumpkin banana bread before but never straight up pumpkin bread. I threw some currants into this batch but honestly, I’m such a purist when it comes to breads that I think I’d even leave them out next time. Ya live ya learn. Sorry currants, it’s nothing personal, I just discovered that dried cranberries and cherries will forever reign in my heart as favorite dried fruit. #sotangy #sogoooooood   This pumpkin bread is incredibly easy to make, requiring just 1 bowl and ingredients you likely have on hand this time of year. Customize it by subbing cranberries, baked apples, or nuts for currants. Or even chocolate! What? Who said that…?  This bread isn’t a super crumbly sugary bread, but rather a bit more dense and hearty. It’s the perfect healthier breakfast or snack, or fall party dessert. Top it with some pumpkin cashew frosting or dairy free cream cheese frosting and you’re in serious business. Like, whoa.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-pumpkin-currant-bread/
0,Vegan Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins  Wowee. It’s fall you guys. And if there’s one thing I love about this time of year it’s that my body begins craving slightly heartier, soul-warming foods. You know like muffins! Pumpkin muffins even. Oops! I didn’t even realize these ones have chocolate chips. Oh well. Guess I’ll have to eat them all.  That’s a total lie. The minute I decided to make pumpkin muffins I new I was going to dump a ton of chocolate chips in there. As if I even had a choice…   These muffins require just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes. The ingredients list is also really simple, with the basics being flour, brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, almond milk, and chocolate chips. If you’re not a big chocolate fan,you can just leave you could easily sub in oats or even apples!   These muffins are UBER moist; as in uber. Some might even be like, “Wow, that’s a moist muffin.” But is that such a bad thing? I will say, however, if you prefer a more crumbly muffin, simply add in a touch more flour and/or a handful of oats to absorb more of the moisture from the almond milk and pumpkin.  Tender, sweet, moist, cinnamon-y (VEGAN!), and studded with melty chocolate chips. That’s what you can expect from these little guys.  I’ve been enjoying mine at breakfast with coffee and in the afternoon with tea. They really are the perfect snack or item to bring to a gathering.

0,Vegan Dirt Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Dirt Cake  If you’ve never had dirt cake – or as I know it: Kansas Dirt Cake – then you haven’t lived. This cookies-n-cream creation was one of my absolute favorite desserts growing up and now that I’m an adult not much has changed, except for the fact that dairy gives me the queezies now. But since I don’t intend to deny my dirt cake cravings for a lifetime, I decided to make a vegan version. The result was a total winner.  It started with coconut whipped cream. The ladies at Lunchboxbunch and Oh, Ladycakes helped me on this one and I finally got a version that actually whipped up like the real stuff! Their tips were genius. I’m forever indebted to you Ashlae and Kathy.  Next came vegan cream cheese (like Tofutti), a 3-ingredient homemade version of vanilla pudding, a little powdered sugar. Look how beautifully this mixture whipped up!  Then we fold the two together: whipped cream into the cream cheese-pudding mixture and voila! We have dirt cake filling on our hands. All we need now is Oreos.   After pulverizing a bag of Oreos, pour half into the bottom of a 9×13 dish, and top with the filling. Ooh lala.   Dump the other half of Oreos on top, obvs.   And the finished product! Just toss in the freezer if you prefer more of an icebox-type texture. Otherwise, just chill in the fridge for 6-8 hours until completely set and chilled. then, dig in. If you freeze it you can slice it more into squares. If you refrigerate it, it’s more of a scooping situation. Either way is delicious, but I almost prefer freezing it first, then letting it set out to soften. What’s left? EAT. EAT IT. Go on, no one’s looking.  This cake is insanely delicious and seriously close to the original. The only real flavor difference is that it’s infused with a bit of coconut from the coconut whipped cream. However, the Oreos are really the dominant flavor, so even if you don’t like coconut give this a try! It’s the perfect indulgent treat for dairy-free, Oreo-loving folks. Enjoy!

0,Fresh Pumpkin Pasta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Homemade Pumpkin Pasta  Several years ago I sat entranced watching Mark Bittman make pasta from scratch on his New York Times video column. I had no idea you could just up and make pasta. As far as I was concerned, pasta only came dried into sticks in a box. Mind -&gt; blown.  Years later Ifinallydecided to give it a go myself with a pumpkin spin in mind. You know, for fall. Plus it turned my noodles an uber pretty color.All you need for this 4-ingredient pasta is: flour eggs pumpkin puree salt water That’s it! So easy, eh?  Then you just boil your noodles for 1-2 minutes and choose your toppings and sauce. I kept mine simple with basil pesto and parmesan cheese. You could also go a more fancy, pumpkin-themed route with my recipe for Spicy Pumpkin Mac ‘n’ Cheese, which can be found in our1 Cup Water e-Book.  Another perk of this recipe? You don’t need a pasta maker or crank. If you have a trusty rolling pin and a pizza cutter or knife, you’re in business.  Look at those fresh, fluffy noodles. Nothing like fresh pasta, according to Mr. Bittman. I 100% agree. If you aren’t a big pumpkin fan, don’t fret as the flavor isn’t that prominent – it’s more of a hint and way to add some color. You could also sub pesto for the pumpkin for a super flavorful pasta, or just omit it altogether and add in one more yolk and one more whole egg as the original recipe suggests.  I loved this pasta with pesto. We also tried it with tomato sauce and it was just as tasty. Though I didn’t try it with my pumpkin cheese sauce, I’m sure it would be dreamy. Enjoy!

0,How to Make Sushi at Home | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"How to Make Sushi Without a Mat  John and I have a thing for sushi. Sticky rice, crunchy veggies, spicy seafood, plus that wasabi, ginger soy combo? Umami ftw. Veggie, california, spicy tuna, fire spitting dragon (is that even a name?) – we eat it all. And while sushi is more of a treat that we save for nights out, it’s also fun to make it at home. But as you know, having one more thing around the house – i.e. a bamboo mat – isn’t really my thing. But you don’t need a mat to make sushi. You just need a few simple ingredients and a towel.  Yep, a towel.  Start by making the perfect sticky sushi rice and chopping up your veggies of choice. We don’t have access to muchsushi-grade seafood in the Midwest, so I most often stick with veggies. But if you live near the coast, get crazy and do the dang thang. (Also, invite me over because I love seafood sushi.)  The towel trick: A thick towel acts just like a bamboo mat and also wipes up your mess when you’re done: win-win. Because it’s so flexible it allows you to shape and roll the rice effortlessly into a beautiful roll. Oh how I love cutting corners.  This method not only allows you to make a traditional sushi roll, you can also go inside out (rice on the outside, nori on the inside). WHAAAATT?  Simply flatten on the rice, gently flip it over, top with veggies and roll away as usual. You can even top your rolls with avocado by layering on thin slices of ripe avocado, topping it with plastic wrap and forming it once again with your towel. Slice, remove plastic and “voila.” So easy and a serious “wow” effect. Your friends will be impressed.  So what’s stopping you from making sushi at home? Nada. Now go forth and make rolls my child!

0,Pumpkin Spice Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Spice Latte Waffles  I love pumpkin. I love coffee. I love waffles. Hooray! Party in the mouth right here, right now.  These waffles are my way of giving fall a big fat hug for arriving right on time. Or maybe fall is giving me a hug… either way, there’s a lot of hugging and waffle eating going on, and that’s OK with me.  John and I have been coffee snobs ever since living in Portland and being exposed to the wonder that is medium-roasted coffee; as in coffee that hasn’t been roasted to a burnt crisp. I used to think, “the darker, the bolder, the better!” Now I know that coffee can actually taste like something other than ash. However, the kind of coffee you want for these waffles is not the good stuff. In fact, I intentionally used over-roasted beans in this recipe because they get offset by the brown sugar and almond milk. Besides, you really don’t want to waste your good stuff on waffles – you want it straight into your face. But really, any kind of bean will do. Just know the darker, the bolder the more you’ll taste it in the final product.    These waffles are uber simple, requiring just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes from start to finish. You also likely have all of the ingredients on hand. That is, if you’re a coffee and pumpkin lover. But I don’t know many people who aren’t, so I’ll go ahead and chalk that up as a given.    I am kind of smitten with these waffles, even though they threw me for a loop while recipe testing. I think I tried four times before finding just the right combination of ingredients – a true labor of love. But the result was so worth it: tender, pumpkin-y waffles with lots of coffee and fall spice flavor. In my opinion, the perfect way to start a fall morning or lazy weekend at home. Plus, they toast up perfectly after being frozen. Enjoy!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-pumpkin-spice-latte-waffles/

Although I’ve never made a pumpkin granola myself, I thought sweet potato would be a fun experiment and an exciting route to take. And so I did (quite successfully, I might add).  This recipe begins with all things hearty and good: Nuts and oats.I opted for almonds, pecans, and pepitas, but you could really go with any nut or seed of your choice. Just make sure they’re untoasted lest they’ll burn in le oven.  This granola gets its gorgeous hue (in part) from sweet potato puree. Just bake up a sweet potato, puree a generous portion of its tender filling, and add it right into the wet ingredients. Slather the remaining portion with almond butter and shovel it directly into your face. Win win.  Sweet potato not only provides a slight sweetness and orange hue to this granola, it also provides a ton of health benefits. Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin B6 (prevents heart attacks), vitamin C (wards off sickness), and vitamin D (boosts immune system), as well magnesium, which can help relieve stress. They also provide ample amounts of carotenoids – an antioxidants that helps fight cancer-causing free radicals in the body and even improve eyesight and immunity. Sweet potatoes are also high in fiber, iron, and potassium. The benefits are practically endless.  This granola is super simple to throw together. You just need: Oats Nuts Sugar Honey or maple syrup Salt Coconut oil Sweet potato Cinnamon &amp; Dried fruit I can imagine it would be equally delicious with pumpkin instead of sweet potato as well. I guess I’ll just have to try another batch to test out that hypothesis. Shucks.  I’m in love with this granola. It’s super crunchy and hearty and perfectly sweet and spicy from the cinnamon. Much to John’s pleasure, the sweet potatoes are not the dominant flavor, but rather another layer of flavor and sweetness. The nuts give plenty of staying power, the cranberries a little tart sweetness, and the oats tons of fiber. Health in a bowl, I say.  I’ve been enjoying mine with almond milk or sprinkled on top of yogurt or a bowl of steel-cut oats. I’d imagine it’s also lovely on top of smoothies or straight outta the bag. It’s simply the perfect fall food with its heartiness and spice. I can easily see it becoming a staple in our house in the chillier months to come. Though I’m not usually a fan of cold weather, if it involves lots of sweet potato granola I think I can get in the mood. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-granola/
0,Baked Apple French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Apple French Toast Bake  Wow, I don’t even know where to start with this french toast… It was inspired by myPumpkin French Toast Bake. It is perfect for fall. It is INSANELY delicious – crispy, tender, gooey, satisfying. It’s packed with cinnamon-sugar apples. It requires just 7 ingredients. It can be made in 1 morning – no overnight soaking involved. That was a mouthful but seriously, you NEED this french toast in your life!  It starts with day old wheat bread cut into cubes and left out to dry. Use my recipe for7-ingredient wheat breadfor a from-scratch experience. Otherwise, any crusty bread will do.  Next, 2 tart and 2 sweet apples for a nice sweet-tart balance.  Now we soak, just as long as it takes to saute the apples. That’s plenty of time to let the bread cubes get all marinated in eggy goodness.  The apples are so simple! Just saute with a little butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar until tender. That’s it. I could’ve eaten this whole pan, no lie.   Oh man, look how delicious and eggy and crusty and apple-stuffed this french toast is! Does it get any better for a healthy fall breakfast?   Bring on the syrup, PLEASE.   This french toast bake is literally the fall breakfast of my dreams. It feeds a crowd!

0,Homemade Bread Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Easy Homemade Wheat Bread  The first time I attempted real homemade bread was with my 7-Ingredient Muesli Bread recipe. I was so thrilled with how it turned out I decided to try it again, only this time with whole grains. Mmmm, I love me some whole grains.  In my original recipe I let the dough rise TWO hours in the fridge. But for this loaf, I was impatient and only let it rise ONE hour in a warm spot. It still puffed up just fine. The only difference was it didn’t hold its “loaf” shape as much and kind of spread out, but I was totally OK with that. It still tasted great.  To add more whole grain goodness I kneaded in rolled oats and millet after the first proof. I LOVED the result – the little grains and oats made me feel extra good about all this extra bread I’ve been consuming (wink).  This bread requires just 7 ingredients. Instant yeast Water Salt Wheat flour Unbleached all-purpose flour Oats Millet That’s it. And it’s virtually foolproof. Just mix, let rise, knead in the grains, proof once more, and bake! The result is a beautiful, grainy loaf that’s tender on the inside and crusty on the outside – just how it should be.  I hope you enjoy this bread! We’ve been enjoying it toasted with butter and jam for breakfast. It would also make lovely sandwich bread. NOTE: But be sure to check back Tuesday for a NEW french toast recipe featuring this bread! Trust me, it’s worth holding on to the majority of this loaf for. Stay tuned!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-homemade-wheat-bread/
0,Easy Stuffed Shells with Dairy-Free Filling | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Stuffed Shells with Roasted Eggplant  I really love pasta; pasta of all kinds. Fettuccine happens to be my favorite but stuffed shells take a close second. As of late, however,dairy has been bothering my system more than usual so I’m currently experimenting with new recipes that keep cheese and other dairy products at bay. Easier said than done. These shells were my first attempt and they came out a supreme success. I actually just had the leftovers for lunch and grinned the whole time I shoveled them in. I couldn’t believe how rich and satisfying they were with no cheese. Bonus: I couldn’t even detect tofu. Win!  So the filling for these shells is simple: Tofu Dairy-free mozzarella shreds (I tried Go Veggie) Roasted Eggplant Pesto That’s it! All that’s left is the shells and red sauce, making this an 8-ingredient meal that only takes 1 hour from start to finish.  If you’ve never tried eggplant in Italian dishes, you’ve been missing out. The roasted eggplant pieces in the filling kind of make these shells. Doused in tomato sauce it’s like heaven on a fork.  John even tried these and said he probably wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between these and normal stuffed shells had I not told him. That’s a HUGE win in my book because he’s not a huge fan of tofu (nor am I). Thankfully, these shells passed the test and will definitely be taking the place of cheesy versions from here on out. My stomach couldn’t be more thrilled either.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-stuffed-shells-with-roasted-eggplant/
0,Easy Vegan Cinnamon Rolls | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls  I once drove 2 hours before work at 5:30 in the morning in the pitch black just to get a cinnamon roll at an Amish bakery. That’s how much I love cinnamon rolls, and apparently how unwilling I am to make them myself. Go figure.  Why doesn’t anyone make cinnamon rolls? They’re complicated, difficult and time consuming. That’s why. But these cinnamon rolls are different: 7 ingredients No complex steps No difficult methods Practically fool proof Just straightforward, fluffy, gooey goodness in cinnamon-roll form. Oh yeah, and they’re vegan. Holy friggin’ delicious.  I was able to keep the ingredients to a minimum by narrowing down what you really need in a cinnamon roll and forgetting the rest. And then I went a step further and tested the true need for “scalding the milk” and letting them rise a second (sometimes third) time. Turns out? Not necessary. And they turned out JUST AS DELICIOUS as bakery fresh cinnamon rolls. This, my friends, is my new go-to cinnamon roll recipe and it just so happens to require 7 ingredients and one lazy morning’s preparation. Behold, the World’s Easiest Cinnamon Rolls.    When I pulled these beauties out of the oven I was mesmerized. I couldn’t believe how fluffy and perfect they looked despite minimal ingredients and time. Although a glaze isn’t really necessary or within the 7-ingredient limit, it’s an easy last-minute addition that will send them over the top. In other words, highly recommended for pure cinnamon roll bliss.   These rolls are: Fluffy Soft Sweet Tender Cinnamon-y Easy &amp; Satisfying In other words, perfection. Hooray for easy cinnamon rolls, finally!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/the-worlds-easiest-cinnamon-rolls/
0,Baba Ganoush Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Baba Ganoush  Baba Ganoush requires a grill:False Baba Ganoush requires a gas stove: False Baba Ganoush can be made by anyone anywhere with access to a broiler: True Hooray!  Have you ever looked at a recipe and rolled your eyes, thinking, “Yeah, right. I’m never making that it’s way too complicated.” Welcome to the story of my life and the idea behind this blog. I love simplicity and figuring out new, easy ways to make delicious eats – such as baba ganoush, one of my favorite Mediterranean dishes.  Baba ganoush is just basically eggplant blended up with lemon juice, tahini and sea salt. Typically you have to char the eggplant on a grill or over the flame of a gas stove. I currently do not have access to a gas stove, and while I have a grill I recognize some people don’t. My solution:Slicing the eggplant into rounds and broiling it to get that roasty, charry goodness. The result? Time and energy saved, and it’s just as delicious as the traditional method if not better. Muahahaha, I love breaking the rules.  So, all you need for this dip is: 1 eggplant 1 lemon garlic tahini (how to make your own) sea salt Optional: fresh herbs. Totally unnecessary but great for an extra flavor boost + more color.  What’s it taste like? Uber creamy, decadent, slightly sweet and the perfect balance of savory and tangy from the lemon and tahini. It’s so lush and creamy you can hardly believe it’s vegan and doesn’t require gobs of oil. Friends, if you’ve ever had baba ganoush this version might blow you away. Try it and let me know what you think. In the meantime, I think I’ll just face plant into this entire bowl.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/simple-baba-ganoush/
0,Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Almond Butter Granola Bars  You guys, these are even better than the originals. Trust me, I just ate two at once to double confirm and they’re in factBETTER. Roger that, over.  What’s the difference between these bars and the first batch? Well, almond butter is the base instead of peanut butter and we added one very essential, very key ingredient: CHOCOLATE CHIPS, YO.   These granola bars are SO easy to make, per usual. All you need is: Dates. Oats. Pecans (or any nut). Almond Butter. Chocolate Chips. &amp; Honey (or maple syrup/agave). Even better? They’re no-bake and take virtually no time at all. That’s my kinda bar. And look, Ma! No GMOs! (Or other random fillers, chemicals, preservatives, and suspicious dyes.) Win!  Theses little guys are seriously amazing. I made 10 two days and we’re already down to 4. As in, I alone have eaten two a day three days in a row. WHOOPS. Too good, I couldn’t help it. Texture: Slightly sticky, soft but not crumbly, and crunchy from the nuts. Flavor: Almond butter, pecans, and dark chocolate chips were meant to be together – period.  So, why haven’t you made these yet? I don’t know either. I’m putting my unofficial satisfaction guarantee on them, however that works with food blogs and the internet. Just trust me – you will LOVE these bars!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/chocolate-chip-almond-butter-granola-bars/
0,Chocolate Hazelnut Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Hazelnut No-Bake Cookies  This summer John and I went to Indonesia. I know, random place to go, but our friends live in South Korea and were going to Bali (Indonesia) for vacation and invited us along. Because of all our free airline miles, we thought “what the heck, let’s go to Bali.” And so we did. And behold, that is where I stumbled upon perhaps the cutest little coffee/food/gelato cafe I’ve ever stepped foot in: Sea Circus. Thanks to the recommendation of a fellow blogger who lives in the area, we happened upon this somewhat familiar “American” food establishment with a Balinese twist. Oh man was it delicious. And the coffee! When you haven’t had good coffee for 10 days + and then someone puts a proper capp in front of your face, you could just die. Just literally die. Don’t even get me started on the tacos… Another reason I loved this place? They had BACIO (chocolate-hazelnut) gelato that was rich and chocolaty and intense with hazelnut flavor thanks tiny bits of hazelnut blended right into every bite. It was intense.   Ever since I slurped down that bacio gelato cone I could NOT shake the idea of making chocolate-hazelnut cookies from my mind. And so to the kitchen I went to test. After one raw batch and one baked, I heavily preferred the no-bakes. I mean, 4 ingredients, no butter or sugar or baking, AND they tasted better? It was kind of a no-brainer.  These cookies require just 1 bowl, 5 minutes and 4 ingredients, meaning they fit ALL THREE requirements for the recipes on this blog. A trifecta of simplicity, if you will. But that doesn’t mean they skimp on flavor or texture one bit. The dates provide ample sweetness and fudginess. The cocoa powder gives them that slightly bitter chocolatetaste. The hazelnuts add that essential nuttiness &amp; “bacio” profile. And semisweet chocolate chips add yet another layer of chocolate decadence. This humble cookie is kind of my bliss. Now, if I could only get back to Sea Circus sometime for another scoop of bacio gelato, then my bliss tank would be all the way full. Until then, let them eat baciocake cookies!

0,Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Zucchini Cake  Wow. Where do I start with this cake? It’s absolutely incredible, moist, hearty, slightly crumbly, sweet, and delicious. That’s where.   Our air conditioner happened to go out the weekend I baked it, which meant sweat was pouring down my hairline as I was whipping up the icing. It was a true act of love and so, so worth it.   The minute the cake was done I popped it in the freezer so I could ice it as quickly as possible, with THIS STUFF. Dairy-free cream cheese icing. Thank you dairy-free “dairy products.” My gut owes you one.  In this here icing we have: Tofutti dairy-free cream cheese Earth Balance vegan butter Vanilla extract &amp; Powdered shuga So creamy, light, slightly tangy, and just as good as the real stuff – guaranteed.  Let’s put it on that cake, shall we?   Wow. This cake is INSANE. The almond meal gives it a nutty, hearty texture and flavor. The zucchini adds moisture and plenty of vitamins C and B and fiber. Applesauce and cane sugar add just the right amount of sweetness. And the icing sends it over the TOP! To keep this cake gluten-free, I used gluten-free oats, almond meal and my favorite gluten-free flour blend. The good thing is it has many elements + an egg for binding, so even if you use a slightly different flour blend, it should turn out fine.  I HAD to have this cake before the summer ended. I adapted the recipe from a family favorite that belongs to my aunt Donna. Donna and I have so much in common: July birthdays, loud laughs, and an extreme love for sweets. No wonder she and I gush over this cake…  If you are skeptical of your ability to bake a gluten-free cake, don’t be. This one only requires 1 bowl! This cake is also very forgiving. I made it the next day as cupcake/muffins and they turned out wonderfully. The important thing is: Make this recipe! Your family and friends will love you for it – promise.

0,Vegan Chocolate Avocado Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Triple Chocolate Avocado Shake  I used to sport a bow tie for work. It’s true. My senior year of high school I got a job at a diner inside a movie theatre that required me to wear a bow tie, purple apron and white button up shirt with visibly ironed creases. Our manager was kind of anal, just like all underpaid managers on an ego trip. If it wasn’t for all the “discounted” (read: free) dessert that came my way, I would’ve ripped off that plastic name tag and fled the movie scene on week 1. But you guys, did you hear that? I had unlimited access to free dessert including my favorite milkshake of all time: Hot fudge, peanut butter banana. Ughughughg. That job was so worth it.  These days if I were to eat a hot fudge, peanut butter banana milkshake, my insides would shake a proverbial fist at me for days. Oh the woes of growing up and having to take care of yourself. So why make a healthier shake? A reader actually wrote recently and requested my take on an avocado chocolate shake. I leapt at the challenge. To start I focused on the base, which I kept 100% frozen to make it ultra creamy and thick – just the way I like my milkshakes.   The triple chocolate comes from the three C’s. Chocolate Almond Milk Chocolate Sauce (or Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge) Cocoa Powder Boom bam boom; chocolaty goodness.  And that’s really it! Frozen banana, frozen avocado and the three C’s. And what you end up with is an ultra-luxurious creamy vegan chocolate shake that’s actually good for you. I mean, there’s a whole avocado in there! Hello health benefits.  No, this may not replace a hot fudge, peanut butter banana shake. But it does satisfy that ice cold, uber creamy, super chocolatey shake of my yester-years. And it just so happens to be made with wholesome ingredients. That’s a shake my system can jive with, and, even thrive on. Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/triple-chocolate-avocado-shake/
0,Vegan Blue Cornmeal Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Blue Cornmeal Waffles  It’s almost fall and the anticipation of it all is turning me into somewhat of a romantic. One of my favorite fall memories took place two years ago. John was still in law school and we’d gone to church with some friends in Lawrence – the city that’d become our literal oasis during our dreadful 2-year stay in the state capitol. It was the first day with a substantial chill. The leaves were in glorious transition to gold and red and appeared like a carefully-painted landscape along the highway as we made the lazy drive back home. Greg Laswell was blaring, numbing our ears, and I felt gratitude welling up in me like a tide, and it was all I could do not to cry. But I did, for quite some time. I wasn’t sad; I had inexplicable joy. Fall has a way of doing that inside me. It provides relief, a sense of newness, coats and scarves, and my heavens does it provide ample opportunities for baking.  One of my favorite fall flavors is cornbread, paired with chili and toasted into croutons for hearty salads – I could eat the stuff every day. I only tried blue cornmeal for the first time last year and fell in love. Its slightly grainier texture and brilliant color make it perfect for baking into hearty breakfast treats, muffins and breads galore. Blue cornmeal gets its gorgeous hue from anthocyanins:water-soluble pigments that also act as powerful antioxidants, making blue corn a super healthy food to add to your diet this fall.    These waffles are so simple to make, requiring just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes. They’re also vegan and gluten free. I love the texture of these guys. Super grainy and ultra crispy, and just slightly sweet. They make the perfect vessel for butter and maple syrup, as well as bananas and fruit compotes like blueberry. Make them even heartier by serving a fried egg on top, or with almond or peanut butter. Plus, they freeze well and toast up perfectly, making them especially convenient for quick breakfasts and lunches on the go.  So bring on the waffles this fall. And the cornbread. I’m already getting beyond excited to dwell in the kitchen as the temps drop to create tons of new soul-warming dishes in this space. Here’s to a lovely start.

0,Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Kahlua Hot Fudge  I’ve had vegan hot fudge before, but this is on a whole other level. I mean Kahlua, come on.  The basis for this recipe is simple: coconut cream, sugar, vanilla, cocoa powder, sugar and sea salt. Then in a fit of boozy glory you add in two shots of Kahlua – the ultimate coffee-flavored liqueur. I don’t have to tell you that chocolate and coffee belong together but I will. CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE BELONG TOGETHER. There, now you know.  This fudge comes together in a matter of minutes. Here’s so: 1. Crack open your can of coconut milk and scoop off the top cream. 2. Whisk it in a saucepan with sugar, cocoa powder and sea salt. 3. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and Kahlua. 4. PUT IT ON EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED EVER. 5. The end.  The flavor of this fudge is NOT overwhelmingly coconut-y like you’d think. The chocolate and Kahlua are actually the dominant flavors. The coconut cream simply gives it a slight hint of coconut and a super thick texture. In fact, after refrigerating it pretty much becomes mousse. Yeah, CHOCOLATE KAHLUA MOUSSE.

0,Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches  So you know I made dairy-free chocolate ice cream. And you also know I made simple vegan brownies. Well then, may the two worlds collide into one delicious sandwich. An ice cream sandwich, that is.  These little guys were a no brainer. I love ice cream sandwiches and always have. Ask anyone who saw me as a child with a constant ring of ice cream around my mouth.  Anytime I have ice cream in the house and anything half resembling a cookie, I mash them together. Don’t ask. Because my brownies were tall, I sliced them in half and sandwiched the ice cream in between. With thinner brownies you can simply stack two. But if you did that with these you would need four more mouths to get your lips around them. Dessert shouldn’t be that strenuous in my opinion.   These sandwiches are so simple to throw together and you can really use any ice cream or brownie you have on hand. I was tempted to add a layer of caramel in between but decided to be a purist for once and let them be. But next time, nuts, caramel, and sprinkles – I’m calling your name. If you’re wondering why this brownie is so close to your face, blame it onTHIS LENS– the love of my food photography life right now. Talk about details. You’d be wise to snatch one up.

0,Garam Masala Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Garam Masala Hummus with Toasted Sesame Seeds This recipe is in honor of my love for all-things hummus. Hummus is yummus; it’s science. I remember the first time I heard of hummus. I was getting my haircut by my super trendy hair stylist at the time, way back in like 2007 and she started telling me how all of the “cool restaurants” are now serving hummus as an appetizer. Hummus. I was intrigued. So I ventured out and located a nearby Mediterranean restaurant and went head first into my first bite of the creamy, garlicky dip I’m now so fond of. It was love at first bite. There’s no going back now.  For this recipe I didn’t have any tahini on hand but I DID have some sesame seeds! So I toasted them up, put them in the food processor with a bit of grapeseed oil and voila! I had tahini on my hands! Just like store-bought but WAY better and creamier! You should do it sometime – it’s much more cost effective and super easy.  So this hummus. It’s flavored with garam masala – a traditional Indian spice blend that usually includes cinnamon, cumin, coriander, black pepper, clove, nutmeg and chili. You find it at most markets these days, but I decided to try my hand at a batch of my own. And thanks to the help of the Kitchn– my go-to for all-things kitchen basics and DIY – it was a total success. Hoorah!  This hummus is so quick, easy and flavorful! You only need: Chickpeas. Garlic. Fresh lemon juice. Tahini (that you made yo’self) Sea salt. Olive oil. Paprika. &amp; Garam masala. Then you’re in biznass, like WHOA. Take a tip from me. The toasted sesame seeds on top MAKE this.

0,Vegan Whole Grain Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Whole Grain Waffles with Roasted Stone Fruit  The recipe I was planning to make for this post was stuffed french toast. But sometimes, you don’t feel like french toast. You feel like a hearty, grainy, not-too-sweet waffle. So, that’s what I did. The result? Hearty, whole grain vegan waffles that just happen to pair perfectly with roasted stone fruit. Oooh yeah.  The batter is simple and can be modified according to what you have. For sweetener I went the natural route: sucanat – natural cane sugar – and molasses. I loved how the sucanat had a caramel-like flavor, plus it’s healthier than standard table sugar when it comes to blood sugar spikes. And the molasses had me screaming for fall to arrive right this second. Molasses and fall go together like Bonnie and Clyde. I checked.   These waffles may not be super crispy, but they are super tasty. Tons of whole grains make them healthy and provide some crunchy texture, and the sucanat and molasses keep them from being overly-sweet. And once you put a juicy, roasted, caramelized nectarine or peach on top, BAM, flavor explosion in the mouth. Don’t look at me – you have been warned.   These gems make a perfect special morning meal for lazy weekends.Open up your windows, stream your favorite music, get flour all over your the kitchen floor and make these waffles. Is there anything better than that? I topped mine with a little almond butter, a roasted nectarine and a drizzle of maple syrup. So, stinkin’, good. The lone remaining waffle in my freezer is currently calling my name. Definitely making these again this fall, and you know what? You should, too.

It’s true.  I have tried making vegan biscuits once before and they did not meet my ridiculously high biscuit standards. They lacked that quintessential buttery flavor and fluffy texture that I so deeply adore. So this time, I read every single tip out there to fail-proof my biscuit making. And I’m happy to report that IT WORKED.  You need just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and these simple ingredients: 1. Unbleached all-purpose flour. 2. Non-dairy butter (such as Earth Balance). 3. Sea salt 4. Baking powder 5. Baking soda 6 Plain almond milk. 7. Lemon juice. That’s it! And you’re well on your way to vegan biscuit perfection.  The commandments of biscuit making, as I’ve discovered, are: 1. Do not over-handle the dough. 2. Never use a rolling pin, fool. 3. Make sure yo’ butter is cold. 4. Baking powder and soda are a must for fluff. 5. Brush the tops with butter to achieve that crusty, buttery top. 6. Make a divot in the middle with your fingers to prevent them from rising in a “dome.” 7. A hot oven (450 degrees F / 232 C) is essential. Don’t ask questions. 8. Biscuits must touch while baking to help them rise properly. I would include a # 9. but it’s simply to eat biscuits immediately. I shouldn’t have to tell you that. A BISCUIT FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN &gt; A BISCUIT REHEATED 3 DAYS LATER. Duh.  These little guys are PERFECT. Fluffy, moist, buttery, savory, perfect with jam, perfect for breakfast, perfect with anything. Hence the reason I’ve dubbed them THE BEST DAMN VEGAN BISCUIT.

CREAMY THAI SLAW WITH BAKED WONTON CHIPS. Yep. THANKS RECIPE. You were simply meant to be.  It starts with chips. Baked chips, in fact. I do like the fried variety but will probably never make them myself because I don’t fry things. It scares me and I fear my arteries will see what I’m doing and seize up before I ever take a bite of said fried good. I’ll eat a Pronto Pup at the state fair no problem. But you will likely NEVER see me dipping a battered dog in my own pot of oil. Plus, I’d probably burn myself and then John would ban me from the kitchen forever because I’m already prone enough to accidents in there. Whoa, that escalated quickly. Bake to zee dip.  The slaw is so simple and fresh AND can be made dairy-free and peanut-free no problem.Sub mashed avocado for yogurt /sub almond or cashew butter for peanut. SOLVED.  This slaw is so flavorful and crunchy! Slightly creamy with plenty of peanut flavor, sweetness, and tang from the lime. I’m kind of smitten with it, especially when served with baked wonton chips. Tortilla chips, you’re cool and all but, you’re no wonton. Just sayin’.  Make this dip for a super fresh and easy appetizer for parties or gatherings. Make it before eating Pad Thai.

In other words, there’s absolutely no reason why you shouldn’t have a popsicle in your fist by the end of this week. Ya dig? Ya dig.  When I was dreaming up my Popsicle recipe I was reminded of the most refreshing frozen fruit experience I’ve ever had. It happened during the peak of summer two years ago. It was hot, everyone was sweating, and my friend had scored a major load of fruit on sale at Sam’s. Since you can’t consume 8 pounds of blueberries by yourself in one week – I’ve tried – she decided to freeze the leftovers into little snack baggies and she gifted one to little old me.

0,Simple Vegan Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Vegan Brownies  By now you’ve probably guessed I’m a chocolate fiend. Something in my lady DNA craves it EVERY SINGLE DAY. Gotta have it. Sometimes that craving can be satisfied with a single square of dark chocolate, a bite of chocolate ice cream, or a healthified black bean brownie. BUT, some days I need a seriously decadent brownie to do the trick. These are those brownies.   These brownies are seriously decadent and only take about 30 minutes from start to finish. The ingredients are basic, too: dairy-free butter sugar flax eggs cocoa powder baking powder vanilla sea salt flour Thas it. Badda bing, badda boom. No black beans lurking here, promise (although it totally works, right!?)   The result is a brownie with that quintessential brownie crust on the top and sides and a soft and chocolatey chewy center. I couldn’t stop at just one, I think I cleaned off half the batch in one day. Oops! But, I did manage to save the other half for a seriously decadent treat that I’ll share soon. Stay tuned!

0,Dairy-Free Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dairy-Free Chocolate Ice Cream  Calling all ice cream fiends! (myself included.) You all know I love ice cream by now – exhibitsA, B, and C – but dairy doesn’t always do me favors. Yes, vegan ice creams do exist. However, coconut milk doesn’t always jibe with my system, either. I was lamenting this fact to John recently when he suggested I try another recipe that’s dairy-free but without coconut. One milk that’s never done me wrong is almond milk, so I knew that would replace my half and half . And to keep it thick and creamy, I knew I would need a more traditional ice cream base. To the drawing board I went.  This ice cream recipe is dairy-free, however, not vegan. I understand it’s not for everybody, but for those of us who are are OK with eating eggs but can’t have dairy, this is the recipe for you. I started with an egg yolk and sugar base. Look how creamy it got!  Alton Brown taught me that I should look for the “ribbon effect” while whisking. I think I achieved that, eh?  Next I whisked the almond milk and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat, tempered the eggs, and mixed it all together with a touch of xanthan gum for extra thickness and a hint of vanilla for more complex flavor. Into the ice cream maker it went and I got super stoked when I sampled a bite and it tasted dreamy. After a few hours in the freezer, it somehow got even better.   This ice cream is thick, creamy, sweet, and satisfying, even though it doesn’t have that stereotypical “creaminess” that comes from full-fat whipping cream. That’s the kind of thickness that pains my stomach anyway, so I’m OK with a different kind of luxurious (as long as I’m getting my ice cream fix). This first experiment was a total success, so I I can’t wait to try even more flavors and mix-ins.     ",https://minimalistbaker.com/dairy-free-chocolate-ice-cream/
0,Vegan Peach Oat Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peach Oat Smoothie  The only fruit I used to like eating when I was little was canned pears. I KNOW. Gross. I think it was a texture, sweetness thing…Anyway the LAST fruit I would ever eat as a kid was peaches. The fuzzy skin just set me off. But then, one summer I tried a peach milkshake and my life has never been the same. All it took was covering it with ice cream to change my mind. Go figure.  These days I’m eating peaches in all kinds of things – crisps, green salads, fruit salads, and, more recently, smoothies. This recipe features two ripe peaches as the star ingredient, frozen banana adds sweetness and texture, and orange juice adds a bit of tartness. Chia seeds make it gel up a bit and thicken, plus add a ton of health perks. And the oats provide tons o’ fiber, manganese, and what-not. Oy!  This smoothie is sweet, slightly tart, thick and creamy and super satisfying for breakfast or a snack. John and I split a batch recently with our morning coffee and both agreed it felt wholesome, just sweet enough and totally peach-y. Hooray!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peach-oat-smoothie/
0,Simple Deep Dish Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Simple Deep Dish Pizza  Pie, pie, I made you a pie. A pie on the fly. Without any ryyyeee! Sorry. It’s late and I really wanted to make you a poem. Somehow I wanted to fit in “It doesn’t have any butterrrrr” and “it’s deep dissshhh” but they didn’t really rhyme with fly, so they didn’t make the cut. You get the point though, you’re smart.  I have never really been a deep dish kind of girl. Thin crust is more my scene, obviously because I can justify more pieces and thus more toppings. Because let’s be honest, IT’S ALL ABOUT THE TOPPINGS, primarily the sauce. Am I right? However, after recently getting the urge to go deep dish on you guys, I did a quick Facebook survey to see if you’d prefer something savory or sweet. To my surprise, the response was overwhelmingly savory. As in SALT over SUGAR. Whoa. So, as promised, here is a savory deep dish recipe and a sweet one is soon to follow for all my sweet tooths out there. SIT TIGHT ladies and gents.  Most deep dish pies involve some super buttery, complicated crust that I honestly don’t have the time or energy or desire to make. I like my crust to taste like crust, not a buttery dinner roll. So I kept this one simple and stuck with my favorite pizza crust that I make almost weekly and keep on hand for impromptu pizza nights. I suggest you do the same. Clearly, it’s the only option.  Once you get past the complicated part of a deep dish pizza, namely the crust, it’s quite simple. You get a round pan or cast iron, and rub it with olive oil. Plop on the dough. Spread and form a 1-inch tall crust up the side. Cheese. Toppings. Lots o’ sauce. Mo cheese. Boom. Bake. Boom. You got a deep dish pizza on your hands. (Only be careful because the skillet will be hot and you may burn yourself three times in the process of cutting it, not that I know that from experience or anything…)  This pie was SO SO good! Despite being butter free it tasted absolutely decadent thanks to the layers of cheese, sauce and roasted veggies. It was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender and slightly doughy on the inside. And the veggies married with the sauce melted in between the cheese was a dream. I could’ve eaten the whole thing, probably, except that my belly could only hold two small pieces. Deep dish is filling!  With a crust prepared ahead of time (or snagging a quality store-bought) this pie comes together in about 45 minutes. It’s such a simple and fairly healthy lunch or dinner option that only requires a handful of staple ingredients. I know I said I liked thin crust before, but….things are about to get all deep dish up in here. I’m in love!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/simple-deep-dish-pizza/
0,Gluten-Free Strawberry Nectarine Crisp | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Strawberry Nectarine Crisp  I have extremely high standards for crisps. They must contain butter and brown sugar. They must be oaty. They must have a 2:1 fruit to crisp ratio (because I’m so healthy, clearly). And they must pair well with vanilla ice cream – non-negotiable. Because like my new favorite summer catch phrase goes, if there’s no vanilla ice cream, it’s like, “What’s the point?”  This crisp pairs two of my favorite summer fruits: strawberries and nectarines. And it’s topped with a seriously nutty, not-too-sweet gluten-free crisp that is worthy of the dessert gods. Trust. The recipe was inspired by one found in my new favorite book, “Bread and Wine” by Shauna Niequist.Shauna grew up eating hand-picked blueberry crisp and vanilla ice cream with her family most Sunday evenings, and it’s a tradition she now carries on with her own family. That’s a pretty OK Sunday tradition, if you ask me. Perhaps we should institute that in our household, at least as long as nectarines are dirt cheap and as sweet as candy.  I was shocked out how much I LOVED this flour-free version. I expected there to be a lack of cohesiveness and crumble, but that was certainly not the case. It was borderline perfection. The pecans were THEE perfect nut to help marry the flavors together, and the almond meal acted as the wholesome, hearty binder.   Nectarines and strawberries became best friends in my bowl, complementing each other perfectly. And the moment the vanilla ice cream started to melt against the heat of the crisp was the moment I could’ve wept and died a happy woman. No exaggeration. Yes, I could get lost in a bowl of this crisp daily. Maybe that’s why I’ve already made it twice in a matter of 5 days. Oops.  If you aren’t a big strawberry or nectarine fan, simply sub in your favorite summer fruit. As the original recipe noted, blueberries are kind of perfect here. I’d also like to try this recipe with all peaches, a mixture of nectarines and blueberries, and perhaps a triple-berry version of some kind. I might even splurge and make John’s half-joking, half-serious request of “Oops, all crisp.” Either way, you can’t go wrong. This has officially become my new go-to crisp and I hope it becomes yours, too. Cheers!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/gluten-free-strawberry-nectarine-crisp/
0,5-Ingredient Spanish Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Spanish Sangria  Let’s talk sangria. The good and the bad. Shall we? To me, sangria should be slightly sweet, plenty fruity, and always red. But then again, I’m probably a sangria snob just like I’m a coffee and anice cream snob. So clearly I’m not the sangria authority of the universe. However, I do know good sangria when I try it, and this is that.  While on vacation in Bali last month, we splurged one lunch and ordered a pitcher of sangria for two. It was fun to try and decipher what all of the flavors and ingredients were, and once we returned home, we wanted to attempt to recreate all of our favorite aspects of the restaurant’s version in our own recipe. It starts with fruit and lots of it.   Pineapple, pear, and orange. Aren’t they the best? They make the perfect sweet and tangy fruit combo to absorb all of that red wine goodness. Speaking of red wines, we went with aSpanish tempranillobecause we’ve been digging wines from Spain lately. It made the perfect not-too-dry, not-overly-sweet wine for the base of this drink.   To sweeten things just a little, we added orange juice, but this is entirely optional if you prefer dry over sweet. This is the beauty of sangria: so customizable.  We were so happy with how this turned out! Smooth with just a little bit of spice from the tempranillo and TONS of fruit to eat with a spoon at the bottom of each glass. This makes a lovely beverage for parties featuring Mexican food. But really, it’d be good for any occasion and pairing. Enjoy!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-spanish-sangria/
0,Vegan Snickers Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Snickers Ice Cream  Three words: Snickers Ice Cream. Happy Birthday to me!  Yes, it’s true. Yesterday was my 27th birthday and I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate than with ice cream – my all-time favorite food group. Don’t worry. I haven’t sold my soul to the egg and dairy devils just yet. I’ve kept this recipe vegan and as simple as possible. That way, I can indulge with half the guilt and share it with all of you. Best community birthday present ever.  Speaking of best birthday present ever, I WON THIS CUISINART ICE CREAM MAKER in theFoodess’s giveaway! I had a suspiciously good feeling about it when I entered my name in the drawing and was absolutely floored when I received an e-mail from Jennifer notifying me I’d won! I kicked, I screamed, I squealed. And then I responded with gratitude and my physical address. Once it arrived it was on. I wasted no time breaking it in with this luscious vegan snickers ice cream. I hope I’m doing Jennifer proud.  This ice cream is simple. Coconut milk. Raw sugar. Vegan caramel sauce. Peanuts. Bittersweet chocolate curls. (And a vegan snickers bar for good measure) That’s it! And it’s so rich and satisfying that I’d almost rather it thanthe actual candy bar. Or on second thought, maybe I’ll have both. Yeah, it’s my birthday so I’ll definitely be having both. Hooray!  The best part about this ice cream, besides it requiring only easy to findingredients, is that it’s fairly hands off. Once you combine your base and let it cool, you let your ice cream maker do the work. You can make this without an ice cream maker, but it will likely affect the texture, making it icier and denser than it would be otherwise. But if it’s the flavor you’re going for anyways it doesn’t really matter. The bottom line is: You need to have this flavor combo in your mouth, STAT. Get to churning!

0,Vegan Snickers Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Vegan Snickers Bars  When I was little I used to love accompanying my mom to the grocery store. She was a gentle shopper, rarely in a hurry and always willing to search around for good deals to save us a little extra money. I’d be lying if I said this is why I loved trips to the store, besides the fact that I just loved being with her. But I most looked forward to the end of our trip when we’d finally lassoed our goods and meandered over to the check out line. That was where the Snickers bars were, right at eye level with 3-foot me. And my mom always let me have one, not necessarily because she was a softie (though she was), but because I always asked and I was quite persistent. I hope any future mini-me’s are a little less aggressive. Either way, my sweet tooth was always rewarded with a big hunk of chewy, peanut-y caramel-y goodness and my chocolate-loving palate couldn’t have been more pleased. Things haven’t changed much since then, only my palate is a touch more refined.  These days I’m into healthier treats, for the sake of my teeth and my adversity to processed goods. So when considering how to veganize my all-time favorite candy bar and keep it simple, I had to get a little creative. So I started with the “nougat.”  At first glance this seems like a overly-simplified way to make a nougat for a candy bar, but trust me, it works. The real stars of this bar are the vegan caramel, peanuts and chocolate anyway – this simply adds a healthier, not-too-sweet base for all of the goods to cling to. It just happens to only require 2 ingredients. Hello simplicity.  The vegan caramel sauce came next, and after three trials I got it right. I simply modified my 4-ingredient bourbon caramel sauce to utilize full fat coconut milk in place of whipping cream. And the result was perfection: creamy, rich caramel sauce with no dairy and just 4 ingredients.   The rest was easy. Layer the nougat with caramel sauce and peanuts. Freeze. Dip the bars in dark chocolate and brush to coat. Freeze. Dee-vour.  How close are these bars to the real thing? Pretty darn close. The only real difference is the denser texture than the original, but other than that all of the flavors are spot on! I was so pleased, and so were my friends, who gladly helped me polish them off in a matter of 24 hours. Stick around ’til Thursday (the day after my TWENTY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY – oh my) to see what else I put these beauties into. I’ll give you a hint: it rhymes with shmyce dream, my favorite food group.

0,Vegan Carrot Coconut Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Carrot Coconut Pancakes  Carrot cake = perfection Coconut cake = the bees knees Carrot + coconut pancakes = pancake heaven. You follow?  These pancakes were inspired by my love for both carrot cake and coconut. I have always loved the flavor of coconut – not always the texture – and find it altogether pleasing and sweet. And if there is a slice of carrot cake around I will NEVER turn it down. I mean never. Even if 5 minutes before I was just complaining about how miserably full I was I would still eat a giant slice of sweet carrot cake with mounds of cream cheese frosting. Just thinking about it makes me hungry, and I just had a snack. You do the math.  But since I can’t realistically justify a slice of carrot cake for breakfast every day, I’ll turn instead to infusing those flavors into a stack of flap jacks. Good enough for me.  What you need to know about these pancakes: They require just 20 minutes, 10 ingredients and 1 mixing bowl. They’re vegan andhave a limited amount of sugar. They have loads of fresh shredded carrot. They have a subtle coconut flavor and light and fluffy texture. They’re perfect with walnuts, shredded coconut and hot maple syrup. They’re light enough for an everyday breakfast and special enough for a weekend brunch. Perfect? I think so.   These cakes are light and fluffy just like they look, and not overly sweet thanks to a limited amount of sugar. The carrot isn’t overwhelming nor is the coconut, but the two seem to pair together perfectly to give it the perfect amount of heartiness and decadence. Although filling, they won’t leave you feeling like you ate an entire loaf of bread. I kind of hate it when that happens.  Though a cream cheese frosting of some sort would be fabulous, that wouldn’t be very vegan of us, now wouldn’t it? So maple syrup it is. Trust me, you won’t regret it.

0,Gluten Free Green Tea Crepes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Green Tea Crepes &amp; White Chocolate-Coconut Filling  You guys, these crepes are a game changer. G-A-M-E changer. Sweet, gluten-free, and flavored with green tea! You’re gonna want to eat 12 of these STAT.  I haven’t always been a crepe lover; pancakes are more my thing. But these may be changing my mind… They’re perfectly light and spongy with just a hint of vanilla-infused green tea flavor. And they’re so simple to make. You just drop 7 ingredients into a blender, whirl, and presto cook-o – you’re done! And then, wait till you see what we put inside…   For the filling I wanted to make a white chocolate coconut whipped frosting after seeing Oh She Glows’ AMAZING 2-ingredient chocolate frosting. I mean, whoa. I employed the same method but I think my can of coconut milk was a dud. If only we could all have that Ladycakefinesse. But, even though it didn’t quite turn out “whipped” like I hoped, it was still SO so good inside the crepes, especially with a few blueberries sprinkled on top.  Green tea crepes + coconut white chocolate filling + blueberries + STRAWBERRY sauce = Magic in the mouth.  I whipped this batch up one recent morning with the help of a friend, we scarfed them down in sheer delight, muttering “mmmmm’s” and “aaahhhhh’s” between every bite. They made an irresistible light breakfast and we both agreed would be the perfect item to serve at a girls-only brunch affair. Oh my. These may not be dairy-free, but they are gluten-free and considerably light. Plus, the ingredients list is so simple (hello, 7 ingredients or less).  I incorporated green tea because I love the taste andit’s so healthyto consume. But if you don’t have green tea powder simply omit it or sub it with another flavor of your choice. I found that the white chocolate filling, blueberries and strawberry sauce provided plenty of flavor on their own.  The best part about these crepes is you really can’t tell they’re gluten-free! The texture is spot on. Bonus: they reheat incredibly well the next day. I was shocked at how good my leftovers were, especially since gluten-free items can be a bit off when reheated. Not the case here. You really can’t go wrong with these crepes! What are you waiting for? Get to it!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/gluten-free-green-tea-crepes-white-chocolate-coconut-filling/
0,Classic Miso Soup with Tofu | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"15-Minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu  Sushi – I think it’s one of my love languages. Sticky rice, spicy salmon, fresh vegetables, fiery wasabi, and salty soy sauce. And don’t even get me started on pickled ginger. Wasabi + soy + ginger = flavor bomb. I can barely handle it. Needless to say, John and I have put sushi on heavy rotation in our eating out options.  One of my favorite parts of going out for sushi is miso soup. It’s so warm and comforting and savory, with perfect little bites of tofu and seaweed in every scoop. Up until now I’ve reserved miso for times when we go out to eat. But when I was feeling a little under the weather recently, miso sounded soooo good to my achy stomach. That, along with a strong sushi craving, inspired me to create some of my own.  Most miso is made with 4 main ingredients: water, miso (fermented soy bean paste), tofu, and seaweed of some form. Miso can be found in the refrigerated section of some grocery stores and nearly all Asian markets. It may seem like an obscure ingredient to buy just for soup, but it’s affordable, incredibly healthy and can be used in many other recipes like soups, salad dressings, marinades, and many Asian-inspired dishes. So, I found it a worthy addition to my pantry.  I wanted to keep my miso classic and simple, but with a bit more emphasis on the greens. So I added some green chard and lots of green onion to the mix and couldn’t have been more pleased with the result. This soup is bursting with miso flavor and delivers the perfect amount of tofu and seaweed in each bite. And for veggie lovers like me, there’s more than a full serving of greens in each bowl. Be still my heart.  Though I think I’ll leave sushi to the experts, I see plenty of miso soup in our future. Next time I think I may go 101 cookbooks on the dang thing and add in some soba noodles. Oh lordy.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/15-minute-miso-soup-with-greens-and-tofu/
0,Vegan S'mores Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan S’mores Pancakes  How does one remember their earliest memory of a s’more? This, I do not know.

I mean, who doesn’t love a s’more, besides John? But he doesn’t count because he also doesn’t like brownies. I KNOW. Who did I marry? WHO?!   These pancakes are WOW, just WOW. I’ll get to the recipe in a minute but will first fully admit that I swiped the top pancake off the stack and consumed it in about 3 bites flat after I was done taking photos. I mean, dang! So delicious.   As always this recipe is simple. It requires 10 ingredients and 1 bowl. Takes about 20 minutes from start to finish. Is vegan and contains whole wheat flour. Tastes JUST like a s’more, only in pancake form. Would be perfect for kiddos, adults, foodies and non-foodies alike. The only requirement for liking these pancakes is that you must like s’mores. Everybody on board? Good, let’s proceed.   The flavor of these cakes is AMAZING. Perfectly sweet with studs of melty chocolate and graham cracker throughout, and a crispy gooey marshmallow top. Not to mention, they have a light, cakey texture that makes the perfect vehicle for all of that chocolaty-mallow goodness. Convinced yet? Seriously, go make these pancakes!

0,Vegan Dark Chocolate Cherry Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Cherry Dark Chocolate Chip Muffins  Can we just talk for a moment about how delicious cherries are right now? They are a more expensive fruit at our markets in Kansas but once I eyed them and snagged a sample to test for ripeness/flavor, I knew it was on. To the kitchen I went, with chocolate and cherries in hand.   Chocolate-cherry muffins, that are vegan! Oh boy. I know chocolate-covered cherries are a thing – my mom LOVES them – but I’ve always thought they were kinda gross. Something about the slimy texture, weird flavor. BUT, when the cherries are fresh and the chocolate is dark and chopped in thick chunks, you know I’m all about it.   These muffins are so simple to throw together, requiring a limited number of ingredients and just one mixing bowl. Plus, they’re considerably healthy as far as muffins go. Whole wheat pastry flour mixed with oat flour provides a hearty, whole-grain base; a touch of brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness; dark chocolate delivers plenty of antioxidants; and cherries provide loads of fiber, vitamin C and cancer-fighting flavonoids. Yep and yep. Also, did I mention they’re delicious?   These muffins may be vegan but they don’t lack in flavor or texture. The’re cakey and light with a sweet, nutty flavor from the brown sugar and almond extract. The cherries are abundant and bursting with flavor, and the chocolate peeks through to give just the touch of decadence you crave.

Where do I even start… The star of this dip is beautiful yellow corn, which is perfect for summer. Corn is officially my muse at the moment.  Since making my creamy Brussels Sprout and Shallot dip last fall, I have been kind of smitten with the idea of mixing cheesy things with vegetable things in a cast iron skillet. That’s really how this dip came to be.  The ingredients are simple, as always: fresh corn, shallot, garlic, light cream cheese, sour cream (or Greek yogurt) and Mexican cotija cheese. From start to finish this dip takes about 30 minutes and requires just 1 bowl and a baking dish. Holy cow, this shouldn’t be that easy BUT IT IS.  How does it taste? Creamy, cheesy, salty, and perfect on a tortilla chip, but somehow still light and summery. In other words, it is perfect. We took this batch straight over to our friends’ house for dinner one night last week and I knew they would like it so much that I planned to leave all the leftovers. A few chip-fuls in and I knew I was right. In fact, it was nearly empty by the time we left. Try this dip! We know you’ll love it. And if you do, share your picture with us on Instagram!

0,Mini Sopapilla Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mini Sopapilla Pancakes  You guys, get ready to party. Sopapilla style.  All of the sudden I had this idea to make mini cinnamon pancakes, and decided to execute last weekend. Pancakes + cinnamon = happiness, I was convinced. I wanted to make them vegan, of course, and although I was half-tempted to make them gluten free, I was really really in the mood for something familiar, and fluffy. So out the window that idea went. I can only do so much accommodating in the pancake department. Breakfast is serious business, after all.  These cakes are dreamy. The batter is thick and light and they cook up all soft and fluffy, golden brown, and bursting with cinnamon aroma. I was keeping my stack warm in the oven while the rest finished cooking and each time I opened the door I got hit with an intense cinnamon donut scent – just like a sopapilla! That’s when it dawned on me: These are no ordinary cinnamon pancakes, they are fluffy and sweet and doughy just like a sopapilla, begging to be doused in honey. So that’s what I did. I don’t argue with the breakfast gods when they make such a clear request.   These pancakes are PHENOMENAL. I know I could say this every time I make pancakes, but these are seriously some of my favorite to date! They’d be great for entertaining or brunch as they’re easy for guests to snag one or two of and pair with something more substantial. They’d also be fun for kids because they’re minis + totally ideal for eating with your hands. Not that I tried or anything… But really, if it’s just you and you’re dying for a sopapilla but don’t want to fry anything, this will satisfy that craving. There’s practically no Mexican dessert desire that these little super fluffy cinnamon pancakes doused with butter + honey can’t fulfill.   What you need to know about these pancakes is they: Aresuper easy to make. Take less than 30 minutes from start to finish. Require 1 bowl, 1 measuring cup + a whisk. Have 8 ingredients. Taste just like a sopapilla. Are light, fluffy, and bursting with cinnamon flavor. Pair perfectly with a hot cup of coffee. What more do you need to know? Get to pancaking!

0,Goat Cheese Caramelized Onion Pizza | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Goat Cheese &amp; Caramelized Onion Pizza  One of the best memories I’ve shared with my in-laws so far is sitting elbow-to-elbow around a crowded couch in their basement, soda cans and napkins sprawled all over the coffee table, everyone eating pizza. All 9 of us. Yes, 9. John has six siblings and he’s the oldest, and every time we get together with his family we joke that it’s like chasing a tornado. You don’t know where it’s headed and how long it will stay and everyone seems to be pulling to go their own direction at every turn. Thankfully they’re not the destructive tornado type, more the “come in make things a little messy and love on you” type. The kind I prefer.  One thing John’s family does very well is pizza. One of the best times I recall was on one of the kids’ birthdays. The birthday boy got to decide what was for lunch and he picked pizza – smart kid. In true Shultz style we all made our own personal pans since the chances of 9 hungry bellies agreeing on one flavor was slim. I’m OK with that. I’m a “heavy on the sauce, pile on the veggies, light on the cheese” type. John loves pepperoni, lots of it. Abby prefers more adventurous types like BBQ chicken, and the other half of the group seems to be all about the cheese. Clearly, personal pans were the best option.  So we all crowded into the kitchen, narrowly missing each other at each turn, flour covering the counters, each one pulverizing his or her own plot of dough. Sauce and spoons left red little dots everywhere and stray cheese and toppings looked like edible confetti exploded all over the floor. Twenty minutes later our (very) personalized pizzas were out of the oven, onto plates and under the weight of swiftly-moving knifes and forks working feverishly to cut fresh slices before the cheese lost its elastic stretch. Andy Griffith was on, eyes glued to the screen when not shoveling in steamy bites of pepperoni and veggies and crust. Amidst the chaos I couldn’t help but look around and feel thankful that I was a part of this little group, this family. A lot of people complain about their in-laws, and maybe rightfully so, but I kind of have it good. Any family that does personal pan pizzas and soda on a Sunday afternoon is the kind of family for me.  Typically I prefer a very standard veggie pizza, but after buying some goat cheese and flat breads for another recipe I couldn’t help but do a little experimenting. Crispy thin flatbreads smeared with creamy, tangy goat cheese and topped with piles of sweet caramelized onions. As is this pizza is stellar, but add a little balsamic drizzle and we achieve perfection.

Before I tried my hand at any homemade versions, we got some form of pad Thai for takeout most weeks when we were newlyweds. One particular evening when John was still the manager at our apartment building in downtown Portland, we got spicy tofu pad Thai and veggie spring rolls and ate it out of brown boxes with chopsticks on the floor of a vacant suite on the top floor of our building. With sniffling noses and full bellies we looked out over downtown through the 20-foot windows and felt terribly blessed by the way our lives were turning out, even if just for shelter, marriage, and Thai takeout.  Thankfully I started experimenting with pad Thai about a year into our marriage mostly to save money and customize to our preferences. Since then I’ve mastered our favorite version – chicken or tofu, lots of fresh carrots for garnish, tons of peanut sauce and a ridiculous amount of sriracha. John loves how filling and flavorful it is, and how it involves boatloads of peanut sauce on every bite. I like that it has lots of veggies, a sweet, savory, spicy marriage of flavors, and that it’s fairly healthy despite tasting completely indulgent. One thing we don’t like about pad Thai, however, is that it requires a million dishes and always makes our kitchen look like a complete disaster by the time I’m finished cooking. This version is an attempt to remedy that problem be requiring fewer dishes, and incorporate even more veggies into the mix, completely nixing the need for noodles altogether. And with that, I present you with noodle-free pad Thai.  This pad Thai uses thinly grated carrots and zucchini in place of traditional rice noodles, dressed in a simple savory-sweet marinade reminiscent of the traditional pad Thai sauce. Then I add fresh tofu, peanut sauce, sriracha, cilantro, and fresh peanuts. The result is a fresher, less messy version that takes about 20 minutes to prepare and doesn’t require any heat, making it summertime approved.  If you’re not a tofu fan, sub chicken or just add more peanuts. If you’re peanut adverse, sub toasted almonds and almond butter for the peanut butter and crushed peanuts. And to make this super quick, omit the dressing altogether and simply slather with peanut sauce. You can never go wrong with more peanut sauce.

0,2-Layer No-Bake Peanut Butter Brownie Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"2-Layer No-Bake Peanut Butter Brownie Bars  Oh, hey there. Today I have one of my very favorite addictions for you – chocolate &amp; peanut butter. Is there anything better?  Ever since making my “raw” brownies + peanut butter pattie dough, I couldn’t help but wonder how the two would pair together. Just as I suspected, they make one seriously sweet couple. I mean look at ’em. Look at ’em, would ya?! How could you go wrong when you start with a base that looks like this?!  This recipe, so simple. And so quick! First make your brownie layer with 5 ingredients, then your PB layer with 4 ingredients. Smash one on top of the other, just like when you were a kid making mud pies in your backyard (am I the only one?) Next thing you know, bam! You have a 2-layer no-bake PB-chocolate dream on your hands. I could cozy up next to these bars alllll night. Don’t even get me started on if they were crumbled over ice cream. Whoa mama.  The chocolate layer complements the peanut butter layer perfectly and they remain tender, soft and not too sweet. These make a lovely dessert, mid-afternoon snack or post-workout bite. I kept mine in the freezer by preference and nibbled on corners throughout the day. They go perfect alongside ice cold almond milk. Good thing we had new friends move into the neighborhood to share with or I’d have eaten these all by myself! Serious yum.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/2-layer-no-bake-peanut-butter-brownie-bars/
0,Watermelon Lime Margaritas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Watermelon Lime Margaritas  John and I have grown quite fond of homemade margaritas over the years. It’s no surprise considering we make Mexican food for dinner more often than we do laundry – and that’s saying a lot since we’re kind of clean freaks – and margaritas always seem to be our accompanying beverage of choice. Though we’ve mostly stuck to more traditional flavors, I couldn’t shake the idea of making a watermelon margarita this summer, so off to the porch we went to experiment one recent evening. As it always happens, the one time you’re doing something somewhat “risque” like making cocktails on your front porch, someone notices. The neighbor’s grandkids just happened to be in town for a visit and decided to go off-season “trick or treating” for healthy snacks, and ended up on our porch…with the liquor. Us, large bottles of tequila and triple sec, and two innocent kids. Quick, hide the evidence!  John quickly hid the bottles before they could ask, “Hey Mr., what’s that?!” as I distracted them by asking the name of their dog. For the record, I don’t remember the name of the dog, but I did successfully divert their attention from the margarita magician shuffling bottles behind his curtain. Potentially awkward disaster averted. Phew.   I happily got the kids a banana almond meal muffin so they wouldn’t go away empty handed, and once they left we got back to business. I’d already made watermelon juice and ice cubes earlier that day and all that was left for John to do was use his magic touch to combine the remaining ingredients: Tequila, triple sec and lime juice. Do yo’ thing, boy.  This recipe is super easy to throw together and simply perfect for summer gatherings. We enjoyed generous sips of ours on the porch after dinner. The weather’s been so gorgeous here in Kansas that we can’t seem to get enough of evenings and afternoons spent outside. Good thing there’s things like fresh watermelon lime margaritas in the world to come to the rescue and cool us down.  Besides requiring little ingredients and time, these margaritas are extremely customizable. If you don’t have watermelon juice, just throw your watermelon cubes in the blender with lime juice and make a frozen blended margarita. If you don’t have watermelon cubes, sub regular ice cubes – there will still be plenty of flavor from the watermelon juice. You can also omit the alcohol altogether to make these virgin and I bet they’d still be delicious. Cheers to the perfect drink for summer!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/watermelon-lime-margaritas/
0,Gluten-Free Pizza Crust | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"The Best Gluten-Free Pizza Crust + Sauce  This time last summer our friend Laura found out she had food allergies. Not the kind that can be cured with an enzyme pill or avoidance of cheese. The kind that require eliminating half your diet. She was heartbroken for it and we were, too. We ate together all the time and the allergies imparted all kinds of complications. But after rallying our spirits we ventured to explore new and better recipes together, namely ones free of gluten since it seemed to be the main culprit in her diet. Laura’s family has always had homemade pizza on Sunday nights – a tradition she loved then resented after she couldn’t participate. She and I both searched for gluten-free crust alternatives but always ended up with doughy, bean-flavored, less-than-memorable results. Then Laura had the brilliant idea to try her mom’s traditional crust recipe, only subbing in a gluten free flour blend in place of all purpose to keep it allergen-free. The result – oh man – no joke, the best gluten free pizza crust I’ve ever had. She even prefers it over restaurant versions now and I nearly prefer it over GLUTEN versions at regular pizzerias! It’s that good. If you have gluten free eaters in your life you simply must try this recipe. As Nacho Libre says, “It’s the baaayyyyysst.”  I convinced Laura to let me share her recipe and photograph her making it. So John and I joined her and her husband Ben at their place on a recent weeknight evening. We split a couple bottles of wine, made pizza and I took photos. Oh yes, and we laughed and joked. We always do. These guys are the best. Husbands watched on as the women worked. Typical ; )   We went with pepperoni for our main topping, boys’ request. The girls pizza had Daiya mozzarella shreds to keep it dairy-free, since Laura and I try to avoid dairy whenever possible. It was insanely delicious. This pizza is super, seriously. Insanely good. It’s so good, in fact, that just looking at it I want it again, RIGHT NOW. The best part? Just 7 ingredients (with the gluten free flour blend) and about an hour from start to finish! The result? A crust that actually gets crisp on the outsides and stays a little tender on the inside. It is a bit delicate as most gluten free breads are, but certainly nothing one can’t master. I’ve watched Laura make it dozens of times now and she’s getting quite good at it. She doesn’t even need the recipe and eyeballs when something looks off. As Shauna Niequist shares in her new book “Bread and Wine,” try a recipe once and follow it to a “t.” Try it a second time and make your own tweaks. Try it a third time by memory and it’s yours. Enjoy.  What are you waiting for? Make. This. Pizza!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/the-best-gluten-free-pizza-crust-sauce/
0,Copycat SQ Blizzards + 1-Year Anniversary! | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Copycat Dairy Queen Cupcakes + 1 Year Blogging Anniversary!  You guys, it’s been a year. One whole year. Happy birthday, Minimalist Baker! The cutest baby I’ve ever had (so far). John and I are currently off celebrating the completion of his law degree and this wonderful, wonderful life we have with a trip to South Korea and Bali. We have friends there we’d been dying to visit and who agreed to be our obligatory tour guides while we shack up in bungalows and learn how to surf during our 20+ day island- and country-hopping tour. Lots of inspiration – both food and cultural – to be shared once we get back. But until then, let’s talk ice cream, minimalism and how this humble site began.  Minimalist Baker was an afterthought. I’d already been food blogging for a couple years on another site when the idea for a new food blog suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. Minimalist Baker was born at Chipotle, so to speak. One evening, as John and I were chatting over steak and veggie bowls, respectively, I told him I had an idea for a new site I’d been thinking of. I wanted to call it Minimalist Baker, and it would be entirely focused on simple, healthy recipes with minimal ingredients and equipment – an exact reflection of how I approach cooking. I’ve always loved food blogs and have followed them for years. But I always found that when a recipe – no matter how tempting it may be – required more than 7 or so ingredients, I bolted, never to consider it again. So the idea behind this new blog would be to keep things simple, focused and entirely minimalist, not only for my benefit but for yours, too.  I knew John thought it was a great idea because his eyes got really big as I was sharing. Like clockwork. We threw some ideas back and forth and the framework came to be right there over our corn salsa, gauc and chips. Days later John had finished the framework and I got to work on our first recipe – Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes– which is still our most popular post on Minimalist Baker. You guys, that post has 621,000 pins to date! We did it, and yes I mean WE. This site wouldn’t be what it is today without your feedback and tweets and pins and love. So thank you for helping us making this site flourish.  In one year we have done a lot. Since our first post we’ve:  Published a FREE7 Ingredients Or Less E-Cookbook. Collaborated to create a FREE 1 Cup Water E-Cookbook,which raised $1,000 for Charity:Water. Published a Detox Guide with 12 healthy recipes to help you hit the “reset” button on your diet. Created an entire Food Photography E-Coursefor $19.99 – a product to help you start taking better food photos today. Created an entire Blog Resources page to help you start a food blog, grow it, and improve your blogging skills (more to come on that front soon!) Published an E-Book outlining 5 Ways to Make Your Photos Go Further (Faster).   So what’s next? Well, for one we’re celebrating with a vegan version of our favorite Dairy Queen childhood treat: A copycat Dairy Queen Cupcake. See how it all went down on Instagram and Vine. Our version is made with coconut milk chocolate ice cream, Oreos, vegan hot fudge, coconut milk vanilla ice cream and coconut whipped cream. Yep, it’s all in there: 5 sexy layers of dairy-free goodness. My cupcakes were so good I could’ve eaten both, with two spoons AT THE SAME TIME. Maybe I did. Who can recount such details…? Make these cupcakes to enjoy this summer, and in the meantime just know that we love that you’re here and want you to stick around probably forever. Or at least until the internet dies. If this next year is anything like our first year, we know it will be a friggin’ blast. Cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/copycat-dairy-queen-cupcakes-1-year-blogging-anniversary/
0,Pretzel Frozen Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pretzel Frozen Hot Chocolate  I have dreams. Big dreams of going to New York City at Christmas time with John, getting all bundled up in winter coats and hats and scarves, standing in awe before the Rockefeller Christmas tree in Times Square. Of going out for an overpriced steak dinner. Of visiting vegan bakery after Greek yogurt bar after New York style pizza shop. Of gawking at strangers and taking in a new city. This dream also includes frozen hot chocolate. I’ve heard Serendipity has the best, but in the meantime this salty, sexier version will have to do. I think I’m (more than) OK with that.  The base is mocha coconut ice cubes. Full-fat coconut milk stirred with cocoa powder and frozen into ice cubes. Then add almond milk, chocolate syrup, a little sweetener to taste, and a big handful of crushed pretzels. The icing on the proverbial cake is homemade coconut (or dairy) whipped cream, more chocolate sauce and salty pretzel sticks. Serendipity who?   This is kind of the frozen hot chocolate of my dreams, and it’s vegan! Coconut and almond milk keep it so, and chocolate syrup makes it sappy, chocolatey sweet. I love salty-sweet combinations, so pretzels were a natural fit. I think I’m in love, and the feeling isn’t going away any time soon. Wanna make it mutual? I really think you do…  This hot chocolate is thick, creamy, chocolaty, and milky. Perfectly sweet with a kick of salt from the pretzels. Lick it slurp it gulp it. Do what you will. I did all three, shamelessly and I think you should, too. It’s hot outside; let’s all cool down with some pretzel frozen hot chocolate, shall we? Yeah, let’s do that.   Hubba hubba.

0,Loaded Black Bean Sweet Potato Boats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Loaded Black Bean Sweet Potato Boats  My obsession with sweet potatoes is getting real. I’ve made soups, muffins, gratins, chips, desserts. You name it, I’ve tried it. But I think after all that experimenting I’ve come back around to loving them in one of their purest forms: Soft, sweet and baked.  I was inspired to make these little bites after wanting to make a “nacho-like” dish starring twice-baked sweet potatoes. The idea to add black beans was natural. The two pair together like PB&amp;J. Then I just had to do some elegant dressing: Green onions, salsa, manchego cheese, and avocado crema.  These little bites are so simple to throw together. Just bake until soft, split open, scoop out the insides, and then load them up with black beans or a protein of your choice and sprinkle with cheese. Pop them back in the oven to warm through and bam – you have an easy appetizer or vegetarian entree to share with friends…or hog all for yourself. Your call. To make these vegan, simply use non-dairy substitutions for sour cream and cheese (such as Daiya products), sub just guacamole, or omit altogether.  These loaded “boats” are sweet, savory and so satisfying. I had just a couple for lunch along with some chips and salsa and was full for hours. They’d make a great take-along dish to barbecues, especially for vegan/gluten-free/vegetarian friends. I just love that they’re healthy, loaded with flavor and super simple. But the fact that they’re portable doesn’t hurt either. Happy munching!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/loaded-black-bean-sweet-potato-boats/
0,Black Bean Green Chili Enchiladas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Spicy Black Bean, Green Chili, &amp; Manchego Enchiladas  Have you ever accidentally met a new best friend? I have. Many times over. My teacher hippie friend Heather and I – who has the most voluminous messy blonde hair you’ll ever hate not having – met at a summer camp in Northern California in 2006 when she took the job as a stand-in lifeguard and I was a 9- and 10-year-old girls counselor. It was her first day and I hated seeing her so alone not knowing anyone, so I walked over and introduced myself. After a spattering of exchanges we quickly bonded over a love for exercise, big hair and blueberries and oatmeal for breakfast. The rest is history. Though we only spent two full months together that summer, we were like sisters by the time I flew back to Kansas in August. And it was one of the most bittersweet days of my young adult life.  Another new best friend story I’ve been loving to tell lately is one that happened just recently. John and I were still in the market for a new rental about a month ago. We’d called on a place and made a 3:30 appointment and got there right on the dot. We walked up and were greeted by the realtor…and another couple who’d also been promised a 3:30 showing. You’d think the whole situation would’ve been painfully awkward but one joke from John suggesting the place was big enough to “go splitsies on,” and we were laughing it up like longtime friends.  As I tell it now, we totally “hit it off” and have been hanging out ever since. They may not be our “best friends” yet, but I’m working on it. I can only make so much bonding magic happen in a matter of 4 weeks.  Our new friends moved here from Ohio and ended up buying a big house right down the street from our new duplex. Upon their arrival they literally had no dishes, furniture or food, so John had the brilliant idea to take them dinner. Why didn’t I, in all of my hostess-y food blogging glory think of that? I decided to attempt enchiladas: Simple, transportable, affordable, and great for pleasing a large crowd. To keep the filling vegetarian, I went with black beans, sour cream, green chilis, and Manchego cheese. And to avoid gluten, I opted for corn tortillas – a first for me, so this was a bit of an experiment. Though they turned out a little bit soggy because I didn’t drench them in hot oil before rolling up – a process I’d read about that sounded complicated and excessive to me – they were super flavorful and filling. This can avoided by simply opting for flour tortillas (see my notes below). I served ours with grilled fajita peppers and onions and a touch more sour cream, and they were simply delicious. John even got seconds, and that’s saying a lot since he’s usually a one serving and out kind of guy. On paper plates in a near-empty living room with wine in Dixie cups, we dined. And we dined well. Chips, salsa, wine and these savory beauties. I hope our friends felt welcomed; we sure hope they do now that they are thousands of miles from “home.” Considering their first-time success, I recommend makingthese enchiladas and sharing with friends – new and old – I have a feeling they’ll kind of love you for it.

0,Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Cup Pancakes (Vegan + Gluten-Free)  Let’s get one thing straight. These pancakes may be healthier than they actually appear, but they aren’t health food. So put away your calorie rulers and speculative eye and let’s get on with this dang thing.  What we have here is peanut butter cup-inspired pancakes. Then we put an actual homemade peanut butter cup on top and eat the whole stack, because life is short and we love chocolate, peanut butter and breakfast. What more explanation do you need?   This recipe is gluten free and vegan but can be customized to suit your needs and preferences. Oat flour and my go-to GF flour blend keep the gluten devils at bay, but I honestly think all purpose or whole wheat pastry would make these a tad bit fluffier. If you don’t want a flax egg, don’t know what it is, or simply don’t believe in it (like John), omit it and use a chicken egg instead. This is your pancake arena. Rule it how you will.  Now, onto more important things: what do they taste like? The pancakes themselves aren’t overly sweet but have the perfect hint of chocolate and peanut butter. The outer ring is infused with cocoa powder, and the inner ring is all about the peanut butter. Because these are gluten free they don’t take on that traditional “fluffy” pancake texture, but if you’ve been around here long enough you know I’m OK with that. In fact, I almost prefer a thick, dense, fudgy pancake. There’s a time and a place for fluffy pancakes. This is not it.   Can we just talk about how insanely sexy these pancakes are!? You MUST, and I mean must top them with an actual peanut butter cup. It 100%makes it. I made mine following Sprouted Kitchen’s famous dark chocolate almond butter cups, only subbed peanut butter, and I highly recommend you do the same. They’re so, so good and get all melty, steamy and gooey on top of the cakes. It’s like frosting on a pancake. Who doesn’t want frosting on a pancake, really? You, raising your hand, get out of here.More pancakes for the rest of us! Enjoy.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peanut-butter-cup-pancakes-vegan-gluten-free/
0,S'mores Rice Krispie Treats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"S’mores Rice Krispie Treats  Oh yes, we’re going there.   I was at Noodles and Co. for the first time a few weeks ago with John and our cellist/runner friend, Arleigh. After scanning the menu and coming to our respective conclusions about what was thee best noodle dish, we approached the cashier and delivered our verdicts. John – penne marinara. Me – pad Thai with tofu. Arleigh, pad Thai without tofu. (side note: Arleigh later tried to steal my tofu because she sub consciously wanted it but forgot to order it. Don’t worry, DIDN’T HAPPEN. Mama needs her tofus.)   Anyway, after placing our orders Arleigh’s eyes got all big when she spotted the basket of desserts, which included rice krispie treats – her fave. “Let’s get the biggest one and split it,” she said, and without waiting for our response she snagged the biggest krispie in the bunch.Off we went to the drink station. The water/soda machine was fancy, digital, not like our familiar Chipotle’s. Arleigh went first as the Noodles and Co. veteran to show us the proper way, selecting the water button first before putting her cup below the spout. John walked up next and, with a smirk looked back at me and said, “I got this.” He then leaned in very close to the machine and yelled “WATER,” and then put his cup under the spout and filled it up to the brim. At that point I felt all the drink station jokes had been used up so I just filled up my water and proceeded to our table for 8 where we gladly parked our three hungry white butts.  The tofu thing happened. I slapped Arleigh’s fork away. We all agreed Noodles and Co. would be a terrible place for a first date. An adorable family of 5 at the table next to us kept us well entertained. And at the end of the meal it was time for the krispie, which we ruggedly split three ways with the dullest butter knife we could find. Marshmallow strings ensued. We were a happy bunch. As I bit into my portion I offered up a rice krispie recipe idea I’d had to add toasted marshmallows instead of regular ones, to give them more of a s’mores feel. Looking at Arleigh you’d think I’d have just proclaimed women shouldn’t have the right to vote or own property. She is a rice krispie purist if I’ve ever met one. Butter, marshmallow, rice cereal. THEY DON’T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.  One week later I was still determined to attempt my s’mores krispie and was so stinking pleased with the results that I had to share. With you all, of course, but also with friends; namely Arleigh. Two bites in and she agreed it wasn’t such a bad idea after all. I seriously doubt I impressed her so much that she’d request a s’mores over an original, but I did prove that originals can be tweaked and improved and made more fun. So there.   Friends, these krispies were made for summer. For cookouts. For camping trips. For messy picnic style dessert. For hot days, rainy days, lake days. They are light and crispy with hints of graham cracker and toasted mallows. The dark chocolate on top gives them a whole new level of decadence. If you make anything from this site this summer – any one thing – make these krispies. You will be the envy of the neighborhood block party for sure. Bottoms up!

Make this grilled corn salsa and you’ll understand what we’re obsessing over. Sweet, slightly charred grilled corn, fresh tomatoes, onion and cilantro, lime juice and a little heat from serrano pepper. Heaven in a dip, I say.Your summer’s about to get a little more legit.  There’s seemingly a hundred different ways to grill corn and everyone’s got their own trick. Well, we’re no exception. John and I have grilled tons of corn during our three years of marriage and we’ve gotten pretty darn good at it. Not to brag, but we know what we’re doing when it comes to grilled corn. The trick? Leave the husk on and grill it first, then once it gets a char remove the husk and strings and put it back on for a little color. Two-three minutes later and you have grilled corn perfection on your hands.  This salsa is everything I love – sweet, savory, spicy, crunchy, and fresh. It’s perfect with chips, on top of tacos, tostadas, or enchiladas, inside quesadillas and atop Mexican pizzas. Perfect any way you serve it – you really can’t go wrong.  What are you waiting for?

0,Gluten-Free Vegan Banana Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Banana Almond Meal Muffins (Gluten-Free + Vegan)  My love for muffins has been going strong for 26 years now and has no intention of slowing. It all started with the crumb-top blueberry muffins my grandma would make for the grandkids. I’d wake up early in a messy-haired daze and eagerly round the corner to the kitchen to always find a plate of fresh baked muffins on the counter. My grandma is the best at food, period. I’d heat up two jumbo-sized gems and slather them in butter. Breakfast of champions, I tell you.  The only bad thing about muffins – besides the fact that you always want two or three – is that they can often be carb- and sugar-heavy. In recent years, though, I’ve experimented a ton with making these breakfast stars a bit healthier, and I succeeded with recipes like my vegan banana nut muffins for 2, and sweet potato almond butter muffins, among others. This banana almond meal variety is certainly on the healthier side, too, but full of flavor and nutty texture.  Besides being gluten-free and vegan, these muffins are also extremely low in sugar with just a few tablespoons of natural sweetener – such as agave or maple syrup. Gluten-free “flours” like oat flour and almond meal keep these GF-friendly. And they’re insanely moist and flavorful thanks to the mashed banana. Kind of perfect in the muffin world, if you ask me. Plus, just 1 bowl required? Party on.  Straight out of the oven these are PERFECTION slathered in a little almond butter and sliced banana. (Honey for non-vegans is a must). They aren’t overwhelmingly heavy or sweet, making them a great post-workout snack or light breakfast to get your metabolism churning first thing in the morning. I enjoyed mine as an afternoon snack to tide me over between meals. They’d even make a great after-dinner “dessert.” These muffins can do no wrong.  But seriously, the almond butter, banana, honey suggestion? DO IIIIITTTTT.  NOTE: Recipe updated January 8, 2016 to include: increased baking time, emphasis on cooling, as well as emphasis on using almond meal ground from raw almonds (not pre-ground store-bought). Also, these muffins are meant to retain their moisture even after cooling. If you’re looking for a more crumbly muffin, check out these Vegan GF Banana Muffins!

0,Curry Roasted Carrots with Peanut Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Curry Roasted Carrots with Peanut Sauce  These aren’t your mom’s carrots. No offense to your mom or her maple glazed carrot sticks, but these are a whole different ball game.  Besides peas, corn and canned pears, the only whole food my mom could get me to eat was carrots.She’d always cook them in pot roasts and they’d get so soft and sweet that I thought they were candy.  These roasted carrots take on a similar softness but are slightly more savory than sweet. That’s because I doused them in curry powder, one of my new favorite spice blends. The sweet comes from the carrot’s natural sweetness and homemade peanut sauce. Such a brilliant combination.  I attempted to make coconut millet for this recipe but it totally failed. So I tried it again using vegetable stock. Much tastier, much less sticky, much…better. If anyone masters the art of making coconut millet let me know. I certainly have not found the “trick” yet.  These carrots would make a lovely side to any entree, especially spicy grilled chicken or even baked lentils. I kind of love carrots on their own so I was content to just have them over the millet with a little peanut sauce, which I found plenty filling. But feel free to treat this recipe as inspiration and make it your own. That has me thinking a curried carrot peanut soup would be amazing….maybe next time.

Get outta here. One of nature’s most perfect works of art, for sure. But eventually I want to eat it. Contrary to what some may think it’s not bitter at all. Quite the opposite actually – tender, sweet and mild – making it the perfect vessel for creamy garlicky hummus (and peanut butter, banana + basil).   I used my favorite hummus but if you’re short on time or just prefer store bought, go ahead! I’m all about saving time and hassle. I just make a batch of my own every couple weeks to have on hand for snacks and quick lunches.  This concept is so simple and customizable. Simply smear your favorite spread onto the chard and top with tons of veggies. I kept mine simple with cucumber, tomato and onion, but you could also easily add herbs, a grainy mustard or even fruit.  This wrap makes the perfect bite to take on the go, such as for work lunches, picnics or beach outings. I suspect they’d taste better on the beach than in an office cubicle, but it’s just a hunch.

0,Frozen Blended Vegan White Russian | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Frozen Blended Vegan White Russian  Things are about to get sexy up in here, White Russian style.  Back in my naive, just turned 21 days, I didn’t know a thing about ordering a cocktail. Long lists of complicated drink names only confused me, and after one too many well-intentioned friends tried to “initiate” me with a Jägerbomb, I nearly signed off liquor altogether. Then came the White Russian.  A White Russian is so creamy, sweet, delicious and secretly potent. I didn’t figure out the potent part until I downed three within one hour and was then found running laps in a nearby parking lot just for fun. Hmmm, glad I’m not 21.5 anymore. While a traditional White Russian is comprised of vodka, Kahlua and cream, I wanted to keep mine vegan so I opted for full fat coconut milk instead. Freeze those babies into cubes and you have the base for one seriously sensational frozen cocktail.  The coffee gets everything going in your blender and adds another element of coffee goodness to this drink. I could’ve slurped the whole batch down, but then I would’ve been running laps around our backyard and John would’ve have that. Thankfully I’m 26 now and just a tad wiser than my 21-year-old self. THANK GOODNESS.   This beverage is a D-R-E-A-M. Creamy, coffee-infused, plenty boozy and only slightly coconutty. Topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce and it’s pure sin.

0,Thai Sweet Potato Stacks with Peanut Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Thai Sweet Potato Stacks with Peanut Sauce  You know it. That first moment you discover a flavor combination so unimaginably perfect that you simply must have it again and again and again. Such was the case with peanut butter and basil for me. Since then, I’ve been cramming the duo into dishes and desserts like there’s no tomorrow. My new obsession is more of a trio: Peanut butter, sweet potato + cilantro.  Being that I’m such a huge lover of Thai food – John and I eat it most weeks – it seemed natural to fuse it into other types of cuisines and foods I love. One such food is sweet potatoes. They’re so versatile in both sweet and savory settings, and I could eat one every day and never tire of them. So it was only a matter of time before I slapped vegetables and peanut sauce on them and called it a meal. Plus, I loved the Mexican-inspired version so much I had to recreate it again.  The concept for this dish is simple: roasted sweet potato rounds, sauteed greens with soy sauce + garlic, peanut sauce, fresh carrots + cilantro all stacked together in one Thai-inspired dish. Perfect for lunch, a snack or a light dinner. These would even make a great small bite preceding a bigger meal. Oh the possibilities.  The sweet potatoes are perfectly complemented by the crunchy greens. The carrots and cilantro add a fresh, flavorful crunch. And the peanut sauce is the liquid gold that holds it all together. The only way it could be improved is by adding some sriracha over top, which I highly highly recommend. Peanut sauce and sriracha were meant to be together, I’m telling you.

0,Butter-Less Alfredo with Peas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Butter-Less Alfredo with Peas  A funny thing happens when you break your blender: You have to figure out how to live without it. Waaaaaaaah.  My favorite alfredo sauce requires a little blending as it tends to get lumpy in spots if I’m not vigilant. But when my faithful G&amp;E blender of 7+ years busted on me last week and we’d promised friends who are new parents a pasta meal later that evening, I was forced to improvise. Luckily I was able to make a few adjustments and even managed to IMPROVE my original alfredo recipe! Love it when that happens. This calls for new recipe sharing time.  My alfredo is based with olive oil instead of butter and requires simple ingredients you likely have on handright now. Pesto, parmesan cheese, milk, flour, garlic, veggie or chicken stock. That’s it! And it’s so creamy and delicious you wouldn’t believe it’s actually healthy.  This version was inspired by springtime. The trees are lush, the flowers are in bloom, and the scent of freshly cut grass is in the air. About this, I couldn’t be more excited.My way of celebrating is by making a simple, light pasta with green peas – one of the only green things I’d eat as a kid. Sorry mom.  This sauce is thick and creamy with tons of parmesan-pesto flavor, yet remains light. The veggie stock adds a nice savory boost that pairs perfectly with any pasta. I chose linguine as it’s my favorite canoodle, but any shape will do. How is there no blending or pureeing required? I add the flour and whisk it with the olive oil and garlic BEFORE I add any liquid. Then a spatula helps mash everything together so I can forgo any blending. Hooray for simplicity, no?  While peas remain the primary addition to this pasta, you can also add some grilled chicken for more protein, or even some toasted walnuts or pine nuts for a little vegetarian staying power. I served mine with extra parmesan on top, a little garlic bread and the leftover peas, which I steamed and lightly seasoned. If this isn’t the perfect spring/summertime meal, I don’t know what is.

0,Lemon Blueberry Waffles (V+GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Lemon Blueberry Waffles {Vegan + Gluten-Free}  When I set off to create a gluten-free waffle that satisfied my my pickiest of waffle cravings, I succeeded with my recipe forGF vegan waffles. You guys loved them too as I’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback! Whoop whoop. Let’s keep this waffle train rollin’.   From that basic concept I altered the recipe to explore new flavors and a slightly different flour combination. They still remain totally vegan and gluten free and supah healthy. And they taste like a lemon blueberry muffin. Yeah, you’re gonna want to jot this recipe down and try it this weekend. I’ll wait while you get your pen and pad….   Lemon blueberry (vegan + gluten-free) waffles! These little guys are a gem. I made my first batch last week and am already down to one waffle. Clearly I didn’t do a good job of rationing my supply.   These waffles are SO easy to prepare, coming together in about 30 minutes and requiring a minimal amount of equipment. Plus, they’re extremely customizable. If you aren’t gluten-free, just use all-purpose, wheat or another variety of flour you have on hand. If you aren’t vegan, use real eggs. If you lack blueberries, swap in another berry instead. I have my eyes on blackberries next – so stoked.  What do they taste like? A dream. Softer than the original version, but still slightly crispy on the outside. They’re loaded with lemon flavor and each bite is dotted with warm blueberries.   I’ve been enjoying mine in the morning with extra blueberries, a little almond butter, sliced banana, and maple syrup. Because they freeze well, they’re the perfect quick healthy breakfast option to grab, toast, eat and go. I also love that they’re special enough for a lazy weekend meal and simple enough for rushed weekday mornings. What more could you ask for from a waffle? Not much, I think. Enjoyyyyyy.

0,5-Ingredient Granola Bars | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Healthy 5-Ingredient Granola Bars  John and I kind of have a thing for granola bars. It started when we discovered the glory that is Trader Joe’s Apple (Pie) Bars. Then, we got into more basic versions with rolled oats. But somewhere along the line we got suspicious of the ingredients – namely high fructose corn devil – and strayed away from them altogether. However, sometimes you really just need a snack that has some serious staying power. And being that this is Minimalist Baker, you know I wanted something simple. Enter: The 5-Ingredient (No-Bake) Granola Bar. Things are getting seriously minimalist right now.     The base for these bars is dates – the natural sweetener supah powah. Then we add almonds, oats, peanut butter, and honey (or maple syrup) and mix it all together! That’s it. Just 5 ingredients, no baking involved (unless you want to toast the oats and almonds) and they’ll keep in the freezer for-ever (that is, if you can resist them for that long).   If you can’t jive with peanut butter simply swap in almond, sunflower or another nut/seed butter. To keep these vegan, stick with maple syrup or agave instead of honey. And to keep them gluten-free, use GF oats. Simple, customizable, delicious.   Speaking of delicious, these little guys are dreamy. Simple flavors, wholesome ingredients, salty-sweet and lots of crunch. I made a batch last week and am already down to one-quarter of ONE bar. How I exercised the self control to save one quarter of a bar is beyond me. But by tomorrow it likely won’t be there, if I know myself at all.  These really are the perfect bar for a hearty snack because they keep you full for hours and don’t provide a sugar overload. Plus, they pack in plenty of healthy fats from the almonds and peanut butter, and lots of fiber from the oats. Afternoon and mid-morning snack, solved.    September 23, 2016: Video added and recipe updated to include slightly more dates so the bars stick together more easily. ",https://minimalistbaker.com/healthy-5-ingredient-granola-bars/
0,Stoplight Mango Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Stoplight Mango Green Smoothie  I made this smoothie because, well, sometimes you need to break out of the mundane and turn your breakfast into something fun like a stoplight. Or a cookie. Or a muff-cake. See? Who said breakfast should ever be mundane…  The inspiration for this smoothie is none other than my favorite fruit at the moment: MANGO. The base is frozen mango – I bought mine fresh, chopped them up and froze them – then with each layer you introduce a new flavor. In this case it’s strawberry and spinach. But overall, the mango is the dominant flavor. Hooray! Also, hooray for super cute straws I found at Target (while not shopping for straws – whoops)! Hooray!  As to how you get that layered effect, simply blend your mango base and pour half in the glass; then add strawberries, blend and pour it on top, and lastly add a handful of spinach, blend and pour it on top. BOOM. Yellow, red, green! Stoplight smoothie for the win.  Breakfast? Yes. Lunch? Yes. Snack? Totally. Go wild friends. Go wild with breakfast again. I give you permission.

0,Gluten-Free Breakfast Tostadas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Breakfast Tostadas  When testing my recipe for Vegan Dessert Nachosa while back,my friend Laura let me borrow a few of her gluten-free brown rice tortillas to try out along with my whole wheat tortillas. I didn’t expect it, but the gluten-free ones were much better than the whole wheat! Since then, as I’ve been trying to minimize gluten in my diet, I’ve opted for g-free options when I can. These tortillas are my new go-to for wraps and the like, and make a perfect tostada base when toasted up and seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper.   They become so roasty, crisp, and flavorful when you bake them on high heat for just a few minutes. They’re absolutely lovely tossed in cinnamon sugar for dessert nachos, but when seasoned with savory flavors they’re equally delicious. Top them with a couple of over-easy eggs, salsa, veggies, and a little sour cream and cheese and you have a legit breakfast tostada on your hands.  While you can easily sub corn tortillas here to keep these gluten-free, I feel the brown rice tortillas are more nutritious and add a distinct crunch and flavor profile that the corn variety somehow lacks. They stay sturdy beneath the runny egg and salsa, making it possible to pick the whole thing up and eat it sans fork if you want! Don’t worry, I wouldn’t judge. I’d totally do it with you if you wanted.   These would make a fantastic weekend breakfast or brunch item, or even a quick and fairly simple lunch. From start to finish it took me about 15-20 minutes including oven preheat and all. Plus, the flavors are totally customizable. I went with radish, shredded kale, fresh salsa, and a little cheese + sour cream. But you could easily keep these dairy-free and go with avocado or guacamole instead. They’re also a great break from tacos and taco salads, which I tend to make a bit too often. Plus, it feels indulgent since it’s crispy. But not to worry as these are 100% baked. Breakfast has been remade once again.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/gluten-free-breakfast-tostadas/
0,Boozy Rum Vegan Horchata | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Boozy Rum Horchata  Remember that date-sweetened horchata we made last week? Yeah, you’re gonna wanna snag that from your fridge again. I have something boozy for you today.  As with our vodka root beer floats, a little taste testing was necessary to determine which liquor best suits the flavors and texture of horchata. Because horchata is a bit thinner and has a distinct, sweet taste, rum and Kahlua (coffee + rum liqueur) were the top pairings. Either will work here, it just depends on if you like coffee. If a boozy, coffee-infused drink sounds good to you, go for Kahlua all the way. If not, stick with any dark rum.   This cocktail is incredibly easy to throw together. It consists of just three ingredients: Horchata + a little extra almond milk for creaminess + a shot of rum. A shaker isn’t necessary, I just wanted to give the photo a “pour” effect. It really works fine to just drop in your rum and give it a swirl. Cinco de Mayo or not, this cocktail is perfect for summertime gatherings and Mexican-inspired meals alike. Enjoy!

0,Peanut Butter Banana Basil Chard Wrap | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Banana Basil Rainbow Chard Wrap  So here’s the thing. I went to our local farmers market last weekend – the first time it’s been warm enough to go – and scored some totally awesome finds. Awesome for Wichita, that is. You see, I used to live in Portland, Oregon, where farmers markets took up entire college campuses and housed hundreds of vendors, 5 of which sold nothing but strawberries. I had choices people, I had options. I was in produce heaven.  In Kansas, we’re in the heart of the Midwest where farming is supposed to be our gig, but for some reason farmers markets aren’t as abundant. It’s typically more of a picked-over tomato and homemade knickknack type of scene. To score some amazing looking carrots or fresh herbs or gorgeous heaps of kale is rare. Our markets simply don’t compare to coastal contenders. But, but, at the recommendation of local friends I went to a market on the west side of town that boasted some of the freshest and biggest variety of produce I’ve ever seen in Kansas. I was so pleasantly surprised that I swiped up nearly $20 worth of organic goods and I’ve dedicated two entire recipes to my finds! The first of which being this hippie-looking breakfast roll-up I’ve been digging that was originally inspired by my lovely friend Aubrey.  While on my Conscious Cleanse,gluten was out of the picture, so I turned to green alternatives instead. At the market I scored some amazingly gorgeous rainbow swiss chard from the sweetest mother and daughter – along witha handful of kale – and immediately went home to make a hearty yet clean breakfast roll-up. The concept is simple. Simply rinse and dry a large leaf of rainbow chard, carve the vein down a bit if it’s too thick (or remove it altogether), slather on a nut butter – I went with salty natural peanut butter – top it with other additions, such as flax, basil and a banana, and roll the whole thing up! I call it breakfast, my co-workers call it “that weird thing I was eating.” I’m convinced they’re the ones missing out.  You know I’ve loved the flavors of peanut butter and basil for a while now, and this wrap takes it to a whole new level. The rainbow chard is slightly sweet and crisp, the peanut butter-banana meld together like a dream, the flax adds a bit of earthiness and the basil gives it a distinct almost minty flavor. I could eat this wrap over a stack of pancakes all day long. Don’t get me wrong, pancakes are great. But sometimes a girl just needs her greens.

0,Vegan Brownie Chocolate Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Brownie Chocolate Ice Cream  Oh dearly lordy dear kitchen in a hat basket I’ve done it again. This time, with chocolate.   You didn’t think I’d let my coconut ice cream obsession escape me without delving into the world chocolate, did you? Good, because if so I was going to have to start questioning our friendship, you and I.  This recipe is so so easy there’s no excuse for you not to try it as warmer temps arrive. The base is coconut and almond milk, cocoa powder brings a rich, chocolaty flavor, vanilla adds balance, and chunks of my vegan GF brownies bring it to a whole other dimension.  Just ask John how delicious it was. He caught me doing more “sampling” than taking photos and nearly had to take the spoon away as I was hovering over the container with crazy wolverine eyes. This stuff is that good and it doesn’t taste healthy, vegan, or gluten-free one bit! So, so pleased.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-brownie-chocolate-ice-cream/
0,Date-Sweetened Horchata | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Date-Sweetened Horchata  It’s almost Cinco de Mayo! Yahoooooooooo!  Did you ever celebrate Cinco de Mayo growing up? Though I’m nearly full German and part Swedish,I did have the pleasure of celebrating this super fun holiday in many a Spanish class throughout my high school and college years. While I never fully understood some of the traditional cultural practices surrounding holidays like Dia de los Muertos, I totally got behind the celebration of Mexican heritage on May 5th. Plus, it was a great excuse to overindulge in horchata, pastries and grilled corn on a stick! Ay ay!   The thing about horchata is, it’s incredibly sweet and usually loaded with sweetened condensed milk and refined sugar. But, health nuts should rejoice because you can still indulge in this refreshing summer beverage without going into a sugar coma thanks to one little healthy ingredient: dates.    This horchata is very simple to make and requires just 5 ingredients, in true minimalist style. Not including the time it takes the rice to soak, it comes together in less than 20 minutes tops. And the result makes it so worth the effort. Creamy, 100% vegan horchata with hints of cinnamon and vanilla, and perfectly refreshing on a hot day.  I enjoyed my first glass over ice but fully intend on making a horchata cocktail out of the remaining batch. Watch out – boozy horchata inspirations are on their way! In the meantime, Happy Cinco de Mayo!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/date-sweetened-horchata/
0,Date-Sweetened Apple Pie Oatmeal | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Date-Sweetened Apple Pie Oatmeal  Sometimes I get in breakfast ruts, making the same smoothie or pancakes over and over and over again. These last two weeks it’s been this date-sweetened apple pie oatmeal. Remind me again why ruts are a bad thing?    I am so incredibly smitten with dates. Have you tried them? I love how they’ve replaced my need for brown sugar in oatmeal. They’re sticky, sweet, and so satisfying. Cut up into steamy oats and they add the perfect amount of sweetness my sugar-loving palate needs.  The apple pie version actually came about by accident. I’d grown quite fond of making a berry compote version but ran out of berries. In my desperation I turned to apples. Honesty, because I was in a hurry the first time I sliced up my apple and microwaved it for convenience (I can almost hear people slinging enzyme-laced insults at me from afar). But you could also saute your apples to keep this process au naturel. In this recipe I baked them. But if you’re short on time make modifications as you see fit (like the microwave). Just don’t tell the enzyme fairies.  I love, love, love this bowl. It’s thick, creamy, warm and full of apple-cinnamon flavor. I usually top mine with toasted pecans, which I highly recommend. But in a pinch I used walnuts instead. Just one serving is so satisfying and always keeps me full ’til lunch with plenty of fiber and protein. You could even add a dollop of almond butter or other nut butter for extra protein, if you wish. I enjoy my oatmeal on weekday mornings since it’s become part of my daily routine. But it would also be a lovely breakfast to make for guests or lazy weekend mornings – the best kind of mornings in the history of weekends. Sub out other seasonal fruits as well! I love strawberry, mixed berry andblueberry versions as well.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/date-sweetened-apple-pie-oatmeal/
0,Fudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake  I remember watching the movie Matilda as a child and being both jealous of and disgusted by the little boy who was forced to eat chocolate cake as punishment for a petty crime he didn’t commit. The glory was raised up on a pedestal – so thick, decadent and fudgy. I wanted to be right there along with him, fork in hand, shoveling in bite after bite as the crowd cheered “Bruce, Bruce, Bruce!” (and Dana, Dana, Dana). But we don’t get everything we want as a child, just like I never got that fancy notebook Penny always carried around in Inspector Gadget. I had a rough childhood, clearly.  But when you grow up you realize many things, like kids really don’t get punished in real life with chocolate cake, it will feel better when it stops hurting (so said my late grandfather), and eating mass amounts of cake will get you nowhere good (so says my mother). But the funny thing is, despite having this realization, the craving for chocolate cake (and lots of it) doesn’t go away. It’s simply accompanied by a guilt fairy that flutters around your head saying “Fatty McFatterson Two Face,” as you shovel in colossal bites.  My solution? Make the cake healthy with things like banana, avocado, honey and oat flour.Then you can flick the fairy away and say “Nuh uh, stupid face. It’s health food.” Problem rectified. Ugh, I hate bossy fairies.    This cake is the fudgiest chocolate cake you’ll ever have and I don’t say that lightly. The first bite in I thought, ‘Did I cook it long enough?’ But then as the texture and flavors rolled across my tongue I knew I’d done something right. Twelve feverish bites later I knew I’d done something very right. This gluten free chocolate cake will fool even the pickiest eaters into thinking it’s loaded with sugar, butter, flour, and eggs.   The texture of this cake is so, so fudgy thanks to the banana and avocado, whose flavors go completely undetected. Honey adds just enough sweetness, and oat flour and gluten-free flour make it slightly spongy and light. We all know what cocoa powder does – it makes it taste like fudge. Hence the name “Fudgy Chocolate Cake.” Oh good glory.  I contemplated frosting but one bite in and I knew it was like frosting and cake in one! Trust me – just a dusting of cocoa powder is all you need…unless you want to add a scoop of vanilla bean or coffee ice cream. That, I suppose, would be acceptable.

0,Green Tea Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Green Tea Coconut Ice Cream  So I’ve been on this cleanse that doesn’t allow me to have sugar, dairy, or gluten (among other things.) You know I have a sweet tooth – hence the name minimalist BAKER? Well, to say the least, it’s been a STRUGGLE. A fruitful, eye opening struggle, but a struggle nonetheless. So what’s a cleansing girl to do when she has a mean ice cream craving? Make a super healthy substitute that’s perfectly acceptable in moderation. Still trying to get the whole ‘moderation’ part down, but I’ll give you an update after my next ice cream recipe (next week!).  This recipe turned out far better than I expected, considering that it contains no dairy or refined sugar. Rich, full-fat coconut milk and unsweetened almond milk marry together to create a thick, creamy base. Honey and dates add a natural sweetness. And green tea provides both vibrant color and flavor.  This recipe is customizable if you don’t have dates or prefer not to use honey, if you’re vegan. You can sub raw sugar, and you can omit the dates altogether and replace them with honey. You can also cut the sweeteners back for a less-sweet, more vibrant green tea flavor. The cool thing is the batter contains no eggs so you can dip your finger in and taste it as you go. Also, no heating required – just a blender or food processor. Simple simple simple. But you must – MUST – use high quality coconut milk, not the generic kind that’s $1 cheaper. It won’t be nearly as ice creamy. I went for an organic brand and you can tell it’s high quality when you open the can because a thick almost 3-inch layer of coconut cream has settled over the milk portion. That’s when you know it’s the good stuff.  I loved how present the green tea flavor was, almost earthy and grassy at moments. It reminded me of a recent trip to a sushi restaurant when they brought out fried green ice cream for dessert, only mine is healthier. Sorry, but it is.

0,Better-Than-Restaurant Falafel (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Better-Than-Restaurant Falafel (Vegan &amp; Gluten-Free)  I’ve been waiting patiently to share this recipe with you guys and I can’t take it any longer. On a total whim, I somehow crafted a falafel recipe that’s better than any version you’ve likely had at a restaurant. Unless it was in Greece, then I’ll give you a pass. But the best part? It’s vegan, gluten free, and chock full of healthy ingredients.  I started with collard greens, a green I was completely unfamiliar with prior to this recipe. Next I added in chickpeas, sea salt, pepper, garlic, fresh lemon juice and tahini. The funny thing is, I was aiming for more of a “veggie fritter” but one bite in and I knew it was falafel heaven all the way.  As always, ingredients are simple and to the point and minimal equipment is required: a food processor and 1 pan. They also come together in about 30 minutes. Hello easy, healthy weeknight meal.  I made up one big batch last week and I’ve been having one or two here and there as a quick snack or easy lunch. I’m gluten-free right now for a cleanse I’m doing(a story for another day), but these would go fabulous tucked inside fluffy pita with lettuce, tomato, and a creamy garlic sauce. I just know it. Otherwise, they’re fantastic on their own with just a spot of hummus.  These little guys are amazing, andI don’t use that word lightly! I am so surprised at how healthy and simple they are, yet how packed with flavor they are. They are crispy and flavorful on the outside, tender on the inside, and loaded with bursts of lemon, garlic, and tahini in each bite. I highly recommend serving these with freshly made hummus – my favorite homemade recipe – or they’re delicious on their own. Simply don’t pass up this recipe!

If so, you’re in the right place. John makes a great bartender.  I have just the cocktail for you. It’s one that John made me a few weeks back on a random Saturday afternoon at the request of “something grapefruity and lime-ish,” and I’ve been pining after it ever since. Freshly squeezed grapefruit and lime juice, two types of booze, and a touch of tonic water for a bubbly effect. Mmm, bubbles.   Simple cocktail perfection is what I like to call it. Or, you could call it a grapefruit lime spritzer. Your call. The grapefruit adds plenty of sweetness while the tart lime offsets it perfectly, and I don’t say that loosely. PER-FECT-LY. The booze doesn’t hurt, either. Just sayin’.  Magazine reading, TV watching, dinner party, evening in for one (or two). These are are just a few occasions this drink would be perfect for. Personally, I preferred the magazine reading, but do what you will. I won’t judge.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/grapefruit-lime-spritzers/
0,Gluten-Free Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Jalapeño Cornbread Muffins  The other night we had a new friend over and I wanted to make something outside of my weekly rotations. This lovely salad from How Sweet It Is caught my eye so I knew it had to be on the menu. While I could comfortably just have a salad for dinner, I didn’t want our guest – or John – to be left wondering ‘what else is there?’ So, cornbread muffins it was. Naturally.  This recipe is adapted from a version Iowa Girl Eats made that I’ve been eyeing for months. In fact, although it’s been in my “bookmarks,” I have neglected to make it until now. I decided to make these gluten-free because I’ve been playing around more with GF recipes lately and was up for the challenge. Go me.  This recipe is super simple and comes together in about 30 minutes. It also requires just one bowl and is healthier than your average cornbread, all things considered. While there’s still a touch of butter, there’s no box mixes involved, half the sugar is replaced with honey, and it includes a full serving of fruit. (I used pumpkin puree but the recipe calls for applesauce – either will work.) Plus, there’s two jalapeños in there, which I’m told is good for your metabolism. I’ll take what I can get.  I was super pleased with the way these little guys turned out. The texture is super moist, they weren’t too crumbly, and the sweet cornbread-spicy jalapeño pairing was spot on.I actually tried reducing the amount of sugar by half but wasn’t as pleased with the end result. So in that case, I recommend sticking with the 1/4 cup for the best results. Also, butter and honey on top (while still warm) is an absolute MUST.

0,Apple Carrot Beet Ginger Juice | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Juice Without a Juicer: Apple Carrot Beet Ginger Juice  By now I’m sure you’ve heard all the cool kids are juicing. Joy the Baker does it. Shutterbean does it. And so doesEdible Perspective. Pretty much all my favorite blogging buddies. Although I don’t have a juicer myself, I’d still like to think I’m a cool kid, too.  Juicing is basically a quick way to get loads of nutrients into your body at once. Hooray for health! The catch, though, is that the juicing mechanisms themselves can be super pricey and take up a lot of room in your kitchen. Because we try tokeep our kitchen equipment to a minimum, both for space and cost purposes, I don’t see us investing in a juicer any time soon. But that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy fresh juice in the meantime.  To make this super tasty apple, beet, carrot, ginger juice, I simply blended it all up in a blender and then pressed it through a fine mesh strainer until I got all of the juice out. Then, I discarded the pulp and enjoyed my juicy juice. This may sound like a bit of work, but it’s really quite simple. It doesn’t take much more effort than it does to rinse say quinoa or fresh fruit. Plus, not buying a juicer saves you money and a bit of space in your kitchen. Not to mention, I hear juicers are a headache to clean after using. See? Things are working out for us already.   This juice is slightly sweet and perfectly balanced, with some serious kick from the ginger. If you’re not a ginger person I’d recommend either scaling it back or omitting it altogether. I, however, enjoy ginger both for its zing andhealth benefits, so I used a good amount. But play with the ingredients to get a taste you prefer; that’s part of the fun anyway. Besides being delicious, this juice is also incredibly healthy with Vitamins A, K and beta carotene from the carrots, vitamin C and polyphenols from the apples, antioxidants and folate from the beets, and anti-inflammatory benefits from the ginger (among others). Some of the nutrients remain in the pulp, but all in all it’s a super healthy beverage that’s much better and fresher than store bought. This was my first try and I intend to experiment with more flavors. Have any suggestions? I’d love to know.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/juice-without-a-juicer-apple-carrot-beet-ginger-juice/
0,Vegan Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins for 2  Sometimes, you need a whole pan of lasagna for dinner guests. Other times, you need just one square of chocolate for a solo indulgence. And sometimes, you needtwo muffins – one for you, and one for another (_______ &lt;- insert: husband, friend, boyfriend, guy it’s complicated with, random neighbor, landlord still waiting on your rent, teacher who doesn’t like you. You get the idea). These muffins are for just that.   I’m not an expert on gluten-free baking (yet), but I’m getting there! I relied on a gluten-free flour blend my friend shared with me and it performed quite nicely. However, if you aren’t gluten-free, simply sub all-purpose or whole-wheat pastry for an equally stellar muffin.(In case you’re dying to know, it’s3/4 cup brown rice flour, 1/4 cup potato starch, 2 Tbsp tapioca flour, 2 Tbsp white rice flour.)   These muffins are made of simple ingredients and require just one bowl (thanks to a little trick I share). From start to finish they take a little more than 30 minutes, and are ready to eat right away. I could hardly stand letting mine cool before digging in.  These babies are moist, sweet and very blueberry-y. I will disclaim that the gluten-free flour gives these a slightly crumbly texture, as it doesn’t absorb liquid like all-purpose. But, if you’re a gluten-free eater, I’m sure you’re more than familiar with this concern. With that being said, I’d recommend loading these babies up with as many blueberries as possible so you get an equal muffin:blueberry ratio. That’ll clear that crumbly texture issue right up.  I absolutely adored how simple this recipe was, how big and flavorful the muffins were, and how I didn’t have tons of leftover muffins to pass out. I don’t do well with leftovers; something I’m working on. Plus, it makes the perfect romantic breakfast treat for 2, something us empty-nesters appreciate in this season of life. If you’ve got more mouths to feed, simply double or triple the recipe. It’ll work just the same.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-blueberry-muffins-for-2/
0,Vegan Gluten-Free Black Bean Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Black Bean Brownies   It seems ludicrous to make your favorite recipes just once, but when you’re a food blogger sometimes you don’t have time for repeats!But, after making asimilar version of these black bean brownies a couple years ago I couldn’t help but try them again. They’re fudgy, sweet, and still one of the best brownies I’ve had to date. Never mind they’re loaded with fiber, omega-3s and tons of other good-for-you ingredients.   Just last week I attempted a vegan gluten free brownie recipe that was a total flop. They didn’t set at all and sort of remained “soup” in the pan. So disappointing. The worst part? I’d wasted an entire bar and a half of my favorite dark chocolate and a descent amount of Earth Balance in the process. Not cheap, not cheap, not cool. Then I thought, “Why would I make unhealthy brownies if I could make healthy ones that I know I love?” See, I do reason sometimes, especially when it comes to dessert.   These brownies are ridiculously simple to make. They require a handful of ingredients you likely have on hand, and all you need is a food processor (or a blender) and a muffin tin. Does clean up get much easier than that? Let me answer that, NO.    Besides being simple they’re insanely delicious. The edges have a slight crispness and the inside is all fudgy, chocolaty goodness. Plus, you don’t have to dirty a knife cutting into them – they’re already baked into bite-size deliciousness. How convenient!  Enjoy these plain, with some vegan ice cream, dunked in almond milk, slathered with peanut butter or topped with fresh berries (credit to my smart friend Arleigh for the berry idea). Better yet, I have another idea for these beauties coming up next week. Wish me luck! In the meantime, bake these brownies and tell no one what’s inside…until they’re three bites in and begging for the recipe. Hooray for healthy deception!

0,Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes and Gravy | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes with Mushroom Gravy  Creamy mushroom gravy.  Fluffy cauliflower mashed potatoes.  The two together make the perfect pair.  I’ve always loved mashed potatoes and gravy but the kind that I like are surely artery clogging. Not so with this recipe. It’s completely vegan, heart healthy, and packs three servings of vegetables. Plus, it’s so easy to throw together, requiring about 30 minutes total, that it’s perfect for fancy weeknight meals and special occasions alike. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, this would be great alongside grilled corn and perhaps a lentil or tofu-based entree. I preferred mine with grilled chicken. But really, it would pair well with just about anything mashed potatoes do.  What do they taste like? The mashed potatoes with cauliflower are light and fluffy, and the mushroom gravy is the hearty, flavorful sauce that melds it all together. I think I’m in veggie heaven.

0,Orange Thyme Jam (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Orange Thyme Jam  Some mornings call for nothing less than a biscuit, loads of butter and homemade jam. I believe I have just the jam for such an occasion.   This jam was inspired by the rustic jams I buy for John and me to use on toast, sandwiches, and such. I’ve wanted to make homemade jam for a while but was always intimidated by the process. Some require fancy jarring equipment – perhaps an investment I’ll make in the future – others pectin, and I just wanted something simple, as usual.   The ingredients list is modest and affordable, and there’s only 1 bowl (or pot, in this case) required. And though it’s a bit more time intensive at about an hour, it’s well worth the effort. The result is a refreshingly light, “springy” jam that’s perfect for warmer weather and all of the delicious food it brings with it. I’ve already slathered mine on waffles, fresh baked bread and on top of cream cheese toast – the latter being my absolute favorite. Somehow the tanginess of the cream cheese pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the jam. I think I’m in love.  Of course, if you’re not an orange person, simply sub another fruit. Strawberries, persimmons, blueberries, blackberries, and apricots would work lovely here and perform similarly as far as preparation and consistency. I have a feeling I’ll be making a lot more homemade jams come summer. I simply can.not.wait.    ",https://minimalistbaker.com/orange-thyme-jam/

0,My Favorite Green Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"My Favorite Green Smoothie  There are a lot of green smoothie recipes out there, and I’m sure they’re all awesome in their own right. But this? This recipe is my absolute favorite and one I drink almost daily.  I know I share a lot of dessert recipes around these parts, but I do, for the most part, eat a very clean diet. I try and incorporate fruits and vegetables into every meal. Things like meat, refined grains, heavy sauces, and cheese are consumed in moderation. Dark chocolate is my only daily indulgence. And if I haven’t had leafy greens in more than 12 hours, I kind of start to hyperventilate. In other words, I love a raw brownie every once in a while, but for the most part, whole foods are where it’s at.  Enter this green smoothie. The ingredients are simple and affordable: almond milk, peanut butter, banana, mixed berries, flaxseed and spinach. And it literally takes 2 minutes to prepare. I love that it sends me out the door with up to 3 full servings of fruit and veg in the mornings, leaving me less pressure to consume two huge salads for lunch and dinner to get my veggie count in. Plus, I love all the fiber it contains, how it has a salty-sweet balance, and how it keeps me full ’til lunch. Really, it doesn’t get much better to me than having a giant green smoothie for breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack.  Though I’ve tried other varieties, this one is my favorite because I can stuff as much spinach in there without affecting the flavor one bit – which, for the record, tastes like a creamy peanut butter banana shake. Hello dream smoothie. Play around and make this smoothie your own. Sub almond butter for peanut butter, try coconut milk instead of almond, all blueberries instead of mixed, another leafy green in place of spinach. But do try the original just once and see if you don’t fall in love it like I have. I won’t be offended if my favorite becomes your favorite, too. In fact, I’d be elated. Here’s to health!

0,Boozy Pecan Pie Bars with Sea Salt | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Boozy Pecan Pie Bars with Sea Salt  pecan pie + booze = better pecan pie. it’s science.  I’m at it again with raw desserts. I really can’t get enough. Why would I have butter- and sugar-laden desserts when I can have one with 5 wholesome ingredients that makes 10 minutes to make and it tastes just as good? My thoughts exactly.  These pecan pie bars are ridiculously easy to make. Simply soak your dates in a little bourbon, then whirl them up with some raw almonds and pecans. Vanilla extract adds a caramel-y sweetness, which balances out the savory bite the sea salt provides.  Ooey-gooey, caramel-y pecan pie bites with a hint of sea salt and a serious kick of bourbon. This is a “healthy dessert” I can get behind.  For those who would prefer a less boozy bar, I’ve included a variation sans bourbon as well. You know, for the morning hour, post workouts, children and the like. They’re honestly both fantastic, so don’t feel like you need the bourbon to enjoy this flavor bomb of a dessert.

0,Sweet Potatoes + Warm Spinach Salad | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dill Roasted Sweet Potatoes + Warm Spinach Salad  I’m all about sweet potatoes. Sweet potato fries, chips, pancakes, waffles, muffins.You name it I’ve tried it and probably loved it. But when my brilliant friend Alina had John and I over for dinner a few weeks back she served us sweet potatoes like I’d never had before: roasted in fresh dill. Friends, I’m never going back to plain again.  This recipe is so simple yet lends itself to a number of different serving options. You could serve it at a side, add a protein during the roasting process such as chicken thighs, whip it up for breakfast alongside eggs, or use it as a frittata “crust.” The options are endless, and all delicious.  The recipe is also quick and easy. Simply dice up sweet potatoes with skin on, as well as some white onions and then toss it all together with olive oil, whole garlic gloves, a crack of salt and pepper and a load of fresh dill. Let it get roasty toasty for about 40 minutes or so and then do with it what you will.  I opted to toss mine over a bed of spinach and added a handful of toasted walnuts and bleu cheese. I was in warm salad heaven.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/dill-roasted-sweet-potatoes-warm-spinach-salad/
0,Peanut Butter Eggs (V&GF) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Eggs  I may have lost my mind with all of this chocolate peanut butter business lately, but I haven’t forgotten that it’s almost Easter. And what better way to celebrate than with chocolate (and peanut butter)? See! I do know what’s going on! Tell John; he’s concerned…   After making thePeanut Buter M&amp;Ms last week (by the way, a MUST try) I couldn’t resist testing a recipe for peanut butter eggs. Growing up my sister and I always had candy on hand during Easter, making it one of the holidays most prone to sugar highs. (Thanks, Ma!) And everyone knows peanut butter eggs are where it’s at. I mean, seriously. Cadbury who? However, I’d like to think I’ve turned a new leaf and no longer indulge in “cheap candy.”Instead, I make my own and must say it’s way better than the super processed junk both in flavor, freshness and health. Make a batch of these PB eggs and see for yourself. I bet you a giant chocolate Easter bunny that you’ll never go back to the original again (OK not really, but, you catch my drift. These eggies are bomb).   These eggs are so luxurious and the perfect way to celebrate Easter (or unwind after a long, stressful day like some of us *ahem* do). The center is perfectly salty and moist and the dark chocolate shell envelopes the PB center perfectly. The two together? Too satisfying for words and crazy addicting, which probably explains why they’re all gone and it’s not even Easter yet. Boo-hooooo. Guess it’s off to make some more! Weeeeee!

0,Vegan Gluten-Free Oatmeal Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gluten-Free Oatmeal Waffles  It’s the end of our spring break here and we had big ambitions to go on a fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants trip to the Grand Canyon last weekend with two other couple friends. But, as the date approached life happened as it does and nobody planned, so we ended up calling the whole thing off.Instead, we opted for a casual brunch at our flat last Saturday morning. Honestly, it was perfect: Relaxing, delicious, connecting – just what we all needed. The Grand Canyon will have to wait for another day, and that’s OK with me. Sometimes brunch trumps road trips.  It isn’t brunch without waffles. Don’t ask questions. We have two friends who are gluten-free and I wanted everyone to feel included and well fed, so I scoured around for a GF waffle recipe. It was a total test that ended up a success. However, they didn’t really have any flavor, whole grains or tenderness. So, after brunch ended I made it my personal mission to come up a recipe better than the original. I believe I’ve done just that. Even John approved, and he’s a waffle hater! ( &lt;—- eewww.)    Look at that stack of glory! The recipe is simple, as always: One bowl and under 30 minutes. It does include a few gluten free flours but I found mine easily and affordably at a local market and can almost guarantee you can, too. If you’re a GF eater, you likely already have these on hand. And if not, just sub in the same amount of all-purpose or whole wheat flour for a similar result (although some modifications may have to be made for consistency sake).   What do they taste like? Awesome in the mouth. Tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, and lightly sweet with a hint of vanilla. Plus, they have plenty of good-for-you ingredients like flaxseed, rolled oats and agave nectar. They were delicious right off the waffle press, and almost more delicious frozen and re-heated the next day in the toaster. The perfect kind of waffle, if you ask me.   Let’s be real, it isn’t a waffle without toppings. I went with a little vegan butter, strawberries, banana, and maple syrup. But these would also be excellent plain, with a few chocolate chips, or with peanut or almond butter. Long live the brunch waffle!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-oatmeal-waffles/
0,Homemade Peanut Butter M&Ms | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Homemade Peanut Butter M&amp;Ms  So, you remember those peanut butter stuffed no-bake bites we made? OK. Do you remember how we had leftover PB dough from the batch? OK. Well, we’re gonna need that now soo ahead and get it. I’ll wait…   OK seriously, how have I not done this before? I did make peanut butter patties and this is a very similar concept, only you roll the peanut butter dough up all teeny tiny and dip it in chocolate! Whoopeeee! Fresh Peanut Butter M&amp;Ms are way better than the packaged kind.  If you didn’t make the no-bake bites and don’t have any of the PB dough on hand, worry not! It’s so simple to throw together. You simply need oats, dates, peanut butter, raw almonds, and roasted peanuts. Then comes melted chocolate – a VERY important element, clearly.   These M&amp;Ms were SO so so so delicious. I offered them up at a recent party with friends and they got snatched up before the fancy dark chocolate squares did. They’re also no doubt healthier than their candy-coated counterparts and arguably better. The only problem? What’s a serving size? I mean really…who eats just FIVE M&amp;Ms? If that’s you. Get out of here. This recipe isn’t for you ; ) I’m more of a1015 M&amp;M girl myself.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/homemade-peanut-butter-mms/
0,No-Bake Cookie Dough Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"No-Bake Cookie Dough Blizzard  Remember those Peanut Butter Stuffed No-Bake Cookie Bites we made last week? Yeah, we’re gonna need those again.  I have been a blizzard fan for as long as I can remember. Who isn’t, really? But I still recall the day I learned that my favorite blizzard – the banana cream pie topped with mounds of whipped cream – had 60 grams of sugar in a small. A small! That news caused me to steer toward a “mini” from then on. Since goingmostly dairy-free at the beginning of the year, I’ve been having major blizzard cravings that I just can’t shake.Enter: the No Bake Cookie blizzard that just happens to be vegan and gluten free. Oh joy.   This little masterpiece is quite simple to throw together. You just need two ripe, frozen bananas, a healthy scoop of peanut butter, a splash of non-dairy milk and you have your base. Next, drop in a no bake cookie bite or two, give it a few more pulses, and you have bits of no bake cookie “dough” throughout a creamy peanut butter banana “blizzard.” Sound good? Yeahtrustmeitis.  This baby is legit. It’s: Smooth, creamy, and perfectly sweet from the banana Slightly salty from the natural peanut butter Fudgy from the bits of no-bake cookie dough dispersed throughout &amp; Completely vegan and gluten-free It kind of goes without saying, but it’s practically health food.

0,Peanut Butter Stuffed No-Bake Cookie Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Stuffed No-Bake Cookie Bites  Remember my 4-Ingredient No-Bake Cookie Bars? Yeah, they’ve been revived and made into a PB-stuffed truffle. Sound good? Trust me, they are.   The concept for this recipe came after a serious craving for no-bake cookies, and I decided to make a batch of my no-bake cookie bars and roll them into balls. After a taste, I decided they needed a bit more saltiness, so I dipped them in peanut butter. Enter thought: oh my goodness they need a PB center. The rest is history.   Despite looking somewhat complex, this recipe is actually quite easy to make. I simply whipped up a batch of my peanut butter pattie dough and a batch of my no-bake cookie bars and then rolled the two together!   The result was a no bake cookie truffle with a salty peanut butter center. These could certainly pass as a healthier dessert, snack or pre- or post-workout bite as they have the perfect balance of carbs, protein, and sweet. Also, I have one more idea for how you could consume these, but you’ll have to wait until the next post to see what it is…  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peanut-butter-stuffed-no-bake-cookie-bites/
0,Cauliflower Twice-Baked Potatoes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cauliflower Twice-Baked Potatoes  Hey, guess what? There’s cauliflower in there (underneath all the cheesy, onion-y goodness). Health food for the win!  I’ve been wanting to experiment with cauliflower for a long time but it’s always scared me with its funky appearance and distinct texture and flavor. So until I figure out how to eat cauliflower on its own, I shall pair it with potatoes. Not a bad combo if you ask me.  These twice baked potatoes have about 1/3 of a cauliflower inside, but you really can’t tell. The texture remains the same as a traditional twice baked potato, with just a slight taste of fresh, steamed cauliflower.  What you need to know about this recipe: – It’s super simple, requiring just 7 ingredients. – It can be made dairy-free by using dairy alternatives to butter, sour cream and cheese. – It makes a seriously satisfying side dish, or with the addition of chili on top, could be a complete meal. – It’s cheesy, dense and extremely flavorful. – Although I have no subjects to test on (yet), I bet kids would love these.  I served mine alongside some grilled chicken and steamed broccoli and carrots, but they would also go well alongside hearty soups, meat entrees or dinner salads. And, they reheat really well, so make a few ahead of time and then snack on them throughout the week.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/cauliflower-twice-baked-potatoes/

These cookies are a result of that desire, and although they were kind of an experiment, they turned out so good I simply could not stop eating them (as in “6 cookies in 1 day” kind of good).  My ingredients are simple: Peanut butter, banana, coconut oil, agave nectar, almonds, and flaxseed. To keep them gluten-free, I opted for GF oats, oat flour, and almond meal. And what kind of cookie would they be without chocolate chips? That’s what I said…   These cookies have some of the heartiest ingredients I know and love, making them more like a healthy snack than a true cookie. But I’m really not much of a butter-and-brown-sugar type of cookie girl anyway, so these suited my fancy much more.   What you need to know about this recipe: -It requires just 1 bowl and about 30 minutes -It’s refined-sugar- and butter-free -It’s vegan and gluten-free -It’s makes the perfect take-along breakfast or snack -They’re seriously addicting… Temember my 6-in-1-day comment? Yeah, ridiculously tasty.   I loved that these cookies were delicious right out of the oven and seemed to become even more delicious after they’d cooled. They became a bit more soft and banana bread-like. Even John had a few, and he’s not much into health food hippie cookies. Success!

Convinced? OK, let’s move onto the flavor bomb that is sweet potato-almond butter. Huzzah!  I first discovered my love for sweet potato and almond butter after seeing a fellow blogger slather peanut butter on her baked sweet potato. I tried it and loved it, then tried it again with almond butter and just a dab of honey. I was kind of blown away and have been addicted ever since. The salty, sweet plays so well together andit makes a surprisingly satisfying and healthy meal (super simple lunch, anyone?). These muffins and these flavors were just meant to be together, there’s no getting around it.  I made sure to keep the ingredients list as slim as possible, as well as the cooking time and equipment required. From start to finish these beauties take about 35 minutes and require just one bowl. All of this equals less time and less mess in the kitchen. Double win. So how do they taste? Awesome. They’re incredibly moist – almost bread pudding-like in the center. And they’re quite hearty, salty and sweet with just a hint of sweet potato and a fleck of almond butter in every bite. I’ve been heating mine up in the mornings alongside a veggie omelet, or grabbing one for a quick snack in the afternoon. I didn’t share any of these with friends but am somehow already down to one. ONE, lonely guy. Looks like I’ll have to get back out my one mixing bowl and do this whole laborious (wink, wink) process over again. Wanna join? Please say yes; I love baking with friends.

0,Vegan Dessert Nachos with Coffee Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Dessert Nachos with Coffee Ice Cream  Rarely does a dessert get me so giddy that I can’t stop blurting out “epic!” while taking photos. Well, somewhat rare. Desserts do get me all sorts of excited. So you remember how I made coconut coffee ice cream a while back? Well I had just a few scoops leftover, but I knew I wanted to do something awesome with them. Then a recent Food Network show I’d seen a while back flashed across my mind and I thought “Dessert Nachos!” My plan was set. Now I just needed to gather my materials and execute – hard. Imade my tortilla strips looks like Battlestar Galactica! Kinda… Clearly I was having fun.  Important tip though: I tried TWO kinds of tortilla chips – one whole grain and one gluten free. It turned out the gluten-free ones worked better! But if you really want to throw caution to the wind, white tortillas would be best because they’re so fluffy and buttery. But I did like how the gluten-free tortillas got crispy and shiny and became the perfect vehicle for scooping up coffee coconut ice cream. Oooooh mama.  These nachos are so decadent and delicious. Reminds me of sitting down at a Mexican restaurant and devouring fried ice cream.Crispy, cinnamon sugar-coated tortilla chips make a bed for hefty scoops of coffee ice cream and a stream of chocolate syrup.  Wait a minute or two until the ice cream gets all melty and then start digging in, using the chips to scoop up bites of ice cream and chocolate sauce. And don’t forget a strawberry (or cherry) on top – desserts need dressing up too, you know?  This would make the perfect dessert to share with your sweetheart or a group of friends.

Then we added some wholesome partners in crime including flax seed, walnuts, almond milk, and whole-wheat pastry flour. Although those eating gluten-free could substitute a gluten-free blend or oat flour and likely achieve similar results. I also added a bit of streusel because the blueberry muffin pancakes(seriously, best ever)performed so swimmingly with the addition. Ooh, la la. Also, these cakes are vegan, come together in about 20 minutes, and require only 1 bowl. Huzzah!  The result? A wholesome, hearty vegan pancake with no added sugar besides a dash of raw sugar in the streusel mix.

0,Sweet Potato Coconut Curry Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Coconut Curry Soup  I don’t know why but curry has always scared me. Where do I buy it? How do I use it? What does it taste like? Is it going to spice my face off? Sadly, these questions were all too accurate. That is, until I tried a few curry dishes and started doing some down and dirty curry research. I quickly discovered there’s nothing to be scared of with this colorful spice. And I now plan to use it abundantly.  Curry is typically a blend of spices that comes in a variety of colors and flavors and even consistencies. You can buy curry paste, curry powder, red, yellow and green curry, just to name a few. And each seems to be best suited for a certain type of dish. Yellow tends to be the mildest of the curries and green the spiciest. Yellow curries get their bright yellow hue from turmeric, green from cilantro and coriander rot, and red from red chilis. With all of these considerations, curries can be made more spicy or mild, depending on the curry base and how much heat is added in the form of chilies and peppers.  Now that we have a basic understanding of what curry is, how do we use it? Curries are most heavily employed in Thai and Indian cooking, and this soup is a fusion of the two, relying on yellow curry powder (Indian influence) and coconut milk (Thai influence. I prefer spicy dishes, so I added some chipotle powder to this soup. But I think cayenne would work well here, too (used in moderation). I didn’t have access to red chili at the time or I likely would’ve tried adding it to the mix.Next time. There will certainly be a next time.  Let’s talk soup. This soup is luxuriously creamy. Comes together in about 35-40 minutes, and requires just 1 pot ( + 1 bowl and baking sheet is making chickpeas). Is naturally sweet from the sweet potatoes and coconut milk. Spicy from the garlic and chipotle powder. And surprisingly filling, thanks to the addition of crunchy, spicy baked chickpeas. The flavor also comes in waves, first savory, then sweet, then “whoa, this is spicy.” If you prefer it less spicy, simply add less chipotle (or cayenne) powder, or omit it entirely. I just felt that it needed some heat to balance out the sweet potato and coconut milk.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-coconut-curry-soup/
0,Toasted Coconut Mocha Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Toasted Coconut Mocha Frappuccino  I remember going grocery shopping with my friend Lisa once and we pulled over to the in-house Starbucks to grab a drink before the hot and heavy produce picking commenced. Lisa is one to indulge when she’s earned it, eating a plate of alfredo pasta if she made it to her morning spin class. Effort = reward; I like it.  On this particular day she ordered a luxurious looking coconut mocha frappuccino with piles of whipped cream, toasted coconut and chocolate syrup dripping down the side. I jealously watched her slurp it down and she must’ve caught on because she offered me a few sips, saying she couldn’t finish it all by herself (though I believe she probably could’ve). How generous. Oh my, it was heavenly.Consider this my healthier homage.  This beverage is so simple to throw together. Simply freeze coconut milk into ice cubes, toast up your coconut flake, then add it all to a blender with a little chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and strong brewed coffee. Oh dear.

0,Roasted Beet Hummus | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Beet Hummus  Isn’t health beautiful? Why yes, it is. After my first go with beets last month for my fudgy beet cupcakes, I had a couple of extra roasted beets I was hungry to use up in my fridge. I was also making a batch of hummus that week. Clearly the solution was beet hummus.  I was a bit afraid of taking my first bite, now knowing it the beet would be too overpowering or altogether gross. But it was stupid delicious. The lemon, garlic and olive oil helped temper the flavor of the beet perfectly. It wasn’t just me who liked it. I shared it with John and several friends and they all agreed it was spot on. Friends, behold – Roasted Beet Hummus.  What you need to know about this here hummus: It’s: HOT pink. Lemony with a kick of garlic. Super creamy and flavorful. Full of vitamins and minerals. &amp; Perfect with pita or veggies or as a spread. It’s also very simple to make. Once you have a roasted beet it’s a matter of throwing everything into a food processor or blender and whisking away. It also keeps for about a week in the fridge, making it the perfect weekday lunch solution or take-along snack.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/roasted-beet-hummus/
0,Chipotle Sweet Potato Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chipotle Sweet Potato Chips  Here’s the deal. I like spicy. I like sweet. Marry the two together and I about flip my lid. That’s what happened when I took a bite of these here chips.   I’ve loved making sweet potato chips so much that this is my third go at it. First, I did plain, then I did DARK CHOCOLATE (what? so good), and now we’re turning up the heat with chipotle powder. Can I just say sweet potatoes and chipotle pepper were made for each other? Ooh, what if we threw dark chocolate in the mix? Don’t even get me started…  These chips are super simple to throw together. You just chop up your sweet potato, toss it in olive oil, sea salt, chipotle pepper and a bit of brown sugar and bake away. Depending on how crispy you like they should only take about 30 minutes. I like mine a little on the crispier a.k.a. charred side. I know, char causes cancer, so said my college Cancer Perspectives and Controversies professor. But I don’t care none. Mama likes her char. Plus he gave me a C+ in that class, so I don’t give him much authority in my life anyway. Char for life! I tried dipping my chips in almond butter and ohmygosh it was delicious! But they’re honestly great just on their own, like, for a snack. P.S. follow me on instagram if you want to see my lunch, and stuff. You won’t regret it, probably.

0,Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches  It’s raining today. I made an early trip to the grocery store this morning before things got damp then made myself breakfast: eggs, toast, and fruit. John poured me coffee and I settled into my familiar dent in the couch to soak in the wisdom and wit of Anne Lamott. Her book “Traveling Mercies: Thoughts on Faith,” is one of my favorites to date.  One of her best lines came in a chapter on parenting when she found herself struggling to let her then 7-year-old son go paragliding off a big mountain. Tofly like “a baby eagle” as she put it. In her indecision she reflected on prayer. “Here are the two best prayers I know: ‘Help me, help me, help me,’ and ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you.’ A woman I know says for her morning prayer, ‘Whatever.’ And then for the evening, ‘Oh well.'” I love this. What more can you do besides be open to whatever comes in the morning and then be OK with whatever happened at night?  I’m still sitting here, sipping on the coffee as the rain ticks on our big, east-facing windows. Feels like a true Saturday to me, the type you can savor and smile at. I got John to eat chia seeds this morning over his fruit salad. It’s the little victories. He said they looked like “ants” on his oranges and apples, but in the end he didn’t mind. What does this have to do with ice cream sandwiches? Not a lot, but I did read “Traveling Mercies” this morning and I ate an ice cream sandwich last night. Does that count? Also, I ate one a few nights ago while watching “The Biggest Loser.” I’d have felt worse if these weren’t borderline health food.I suppose these just make good lazy activity snacks.   What you need to know about this recipe: They’re vegan, creamy, cappuccino mocha-y. The chocolate “cakies” are made with oat flour, coconut oil and raw sugar. I shared the coconut coffee ice cream earlier in the previous post. They make excellent late night “snacks.” You need to let them melt a little bit before eating. Otherwise, the flavors aren’t as present. (microwave for 20 if you must) They would be delectable dunked in dark chocolate. (why didn’t I do that?) They’re overall very simple to make.

0,Coffee Coconut Ice Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Coffee Coconut Ice Cream  So the no-dairy thingis going OK. I’m feeling better each time I opt for dairy-free alternatives, and I’m actually starting to crave my swig of almond milk in the mornings after my obligatory almond butter, banana toast. I still cannot believe I haven’t had ice cream since December 2012. This is unheard of. But thankfully with options like cinnamon toast ice cream and now this coffee variety, my sanity is still intact, I haven’t strangled anyone, and my sweet tooth is somehow satisfied. Thank the Lerrrd. This recipe is incredibly simple to throw together, requiring just four ingredients and very little hands-on prep time. I snagged my friend’s ice cream maker again, but it’s not necessary (though it makes it oh so creamy and fluffy). I’ve shared a few tips below if you’re sans-ice cream maker.  The texture of this ice cream is so creamy, the vanilla adds a lovely cappuccino flavor, the bold coffee is offset by the sweetness of the coconut milk, and it’s only slightly sweet thanks to a reduced amount of raw sugar. You can, of course, add more sugar if you like, but I prefer my coffee ice cream like I prefer my coffee – as close to black as possible. Modify as you see fit.  I almost added chocolate chunks or a fudge swirl to this recipe, but I figured I’d be a purist with this first coffee test batch. Watch out, though. More adventurous concoctions are sure to come soon, especially as the weather warms up.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/coffee-coconut-ice-cream/
0,Vegan Berry Pop-Tarts | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Berry Pop-Tarts  If I were to speculate, I’ve probably eaten around 250 Pop-Tarts in my lifetime. And not the kind with the baby zebra on the box with no sugar added, whole fruit, wheat crust, and no frosting. WHO EATS A POP-TART SANS FROSTING? That’s what I wanna know. No, the kind I consumed were of the brown sugar cinnamon, strawberry, cherry, or wild berry variety with the purple frosting with blue swishes across the front. My mom would toast two up, slather them in I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, and carry them downstairs to me, where I’d inhale bites between strokes of mascara and lip gloss before school. Now THAT’S how you eat a Pop-Tart, kids. That is, unless you’ve turned a new leaf and no longer consume high fructose corn syrup, blue lake dye, andhydrogenatedoils. See where I’m going with this?  Yes, healthy Pop-Tarts. That’s what we have here.   I’ve tried to make Pop-Tarts before with Greek yogurt or whole wheat flour in the crust to slash calories, but let’s be honest: They tasted like sand. So this time, I wised up. I used Earth Balance and whole-wheat pastry flour and kept my fillings as simple as can be – pure fruit compote. Friends, we have a winner.   These glories are vegan and fairly simple to throw together, requiring just 7 ingredients and about 45 minutes of your precious, precious time. After all, who would actually make Pop-Tarts if they took 5 hours to prepare? Not I, and neither should you. You deserve better than that. We deserve better than that.  You will love these Pop-Tarts. The crust is flaky and buttery (despite using vegan butter). The filling is tender, fruity and naturally sweet. The raw sugar on top provides a delightful crunch. And the optional vegan vanilla glaze sends me straight back to my childhood, sans GMOs. Gah, life is good again, thanks to healthified Pop-Tarts.

0,Peanut Butter Flaxseed Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter Flaxseed Pancakes  I love pancakes. But I don’t love how they can sometimes leave me feeling like I just ate an entire loaf of bread. Do you ever feel that way? This must be a symptom of getting old(er). But we can fix that. One grain that doesn’t leave me feeling sluggish is oats! That’s why I’ve based this pancake with oat flour instead of all purpose, because it’s healthier.  For starters, 1/2 cup of oat flour has 80 fewer calories and 20 fewer grams carbohydrates than 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. They’re also high in iron, magnesium and fiber, and contain the amino acid lysine, which promotes replenishment of body tissues like muscles and nerves – this makes them an excellent food staple for fitness junkies. Oats can also help lower cholesterol levels and help us feel fuller longer. Seriously, super power food in the house. To make oat flour you simply process oats in a coffee grinder until a fine powder remains. You can also buy it at the grocery store (gluten-free optional) or make a big batch at home and store it in your pantry for quick mornings breakfasts like these pancakes.   These pancakes are so simple to make: Just 1 bowl and 15 minutes required. You could even make them with other nut butters if you have a peanut allergy. More importantly they’re fluffy, filled with good-for-you ingredients, and packed with some serious peanut butter flavor. I topped mine with a little peanut butter sauce (just peanut butter whisked with very hot water) and a little maple syrup. But they’d also be great with sliced bananas, honey or jam (hello PB&amp;J).  These will definitely be my new go-to pancakes since I always have the ingredients on hand and they’re perfect even for busy weekday mornings. So excited to share these lovely cakes with you. Hope you enjoy.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peanut-butter-flaxseed-pancakes/
0,Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup  Hey, hey, hey it’s tomato soup! With its buddy roasted red pepper. Oh, they’re going to hit it off so well, I just know it.   I’d never made tomato soup before – I know. What the heck? But I fixed that this week. In the midst of some chilly winter weather I had serious a craving for grilled cheese and tomato soup, so I got to work. The recipe is inspired by one I found in the Sprouted Kitchen cookbook, only it’s a vegan version with the addition of roasted red pepper.  10 ingredients and simple seasonings – you likely have everything you need on hand right now. If you’ve never taken the leap and made your own tomato soup, now is the perfect time to do it. Besides, you already have a grilled cheese to use as a spoon. A big, cheesy, delicious spoon. This soup can be made as intensely flavorful as you wish by simply adding more garlic, salt and pepper, fresh herbs and/or additional tomato paste. It can also be made more rich by adding real cream. I opted for almond milk to keep it dairy free, but I can imagine the real stuff would send it over the top. I loved how filling and satisfying it was and am excited that I now have a go-to tomato soup recipe as it’s one of my favorite winter dishes. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

0,Fudgy Vegan Beet Cupcakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Fudgy Vegan Beet Cupcakes  Before you say anything bad about these cupcakes, have you tried my chocolate covered sweet potato chips yet? Because if you have then you know I know a thing or two aboutdesserts– just sayin’.   I’ve been wanting to put beets in my dessert for a while now, seeing as they pair so well with chocolate. But none of the recipes I’d seen before were vegan, so I knew experimenting was a must. If you haven’t been previously warned about beets, consider this your official warning. They, are, messy.  After a roast in the oven beets get all soft and juicy and perfect for adding to things like cupcakes because they don’t have a particularly offensive flavor and add a ton of nutrients and moisture to baked goods. Beets may be unsightly – and stain your hands pink – but they’re extremely healthy for you. Loaded with vitamins A, B and C, they’re also high in fiber, manganese, folate and are a rare source of phytonutrients called betalains, which have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxification qualities (find out more here). All of that goodness inside these cupcakes? Who would’ve thought?   Now of course, that doesn’t meant you should eat cupcakes instead of beets. That just means you should eat beets and have an occasional cupcake. Trust me, I tried to reverse this information but the health food gods didn’t seem to want to budge. I’ll keep trying on both of our behalf, though.  What you need to know about these cupcakes:  They require one bowl They’re vegan They really don’t need frosting They’re rich, moist and cakey They are fudgy and addictive They don’t taste like beets Not one bit  Satisfied?

0,Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard  When you’ve been an ice cream addict like me for 26 years, giving the stuff up is rough. I’d rather endure weaning all over again than try and shake my double scoop habit. Thankfully though, I’ve found something that satisfies my deepest, darkest most intense ice cream cravings – this Chocolate Brownie Batter Blizzard that doesn’t contain one lick of dairy. Oh me oh my. oh.   The base is a spin off of my creamy chocolate breakfast shake, and the brownie should look familiar from earlier this week: my 5-minute espresso walnut brownies. Marry the two together and we have one insanely rich spoonable beverage on our hands. Dare I say, worthy of the title “blizzard”? Yes, I do.  Just looking at the pictures again I already want another. The base is rich with chocolate flavor and you can’t detect the strawberries one bit. The banana flavor is ever-so-subtle so even if you’re a banana hater I’d still suggest you give it a try. The no-bake brownie bits melt into the shake seamlessly and get all fudgy and creamy and every bite seems better than the last. The best part? It really is healthy enough to be breakfast. Sure, there’s a lot of sugar but it’s from all natural sources and there’s no gluten, dairy or unhealthy fats. See, told you it’s perfect for breakfast. Cheers!

0,5-Minute Espresso Walnut Brownies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Minute Espresso Walnut Brownies  I learned something this week: Cocoa powder isn’t raw, it’s cooked. Therefore, just because a brownie isn’t baked like these fudgy beauties doesn’t mean they’re truly raw. This is good to know.  You see I’ve been learning a lot about whole foods lately. It all started with my stumbling upon Sprouted Kitchenwhere whole foods are tasty, and thenordering the Sprouted Kitchen cookbook.Since then I’ve been treating the thing like it’s my new foodie bible, because it is. After that profound discovery came My New Roots, which I could rattle on about for hours. But for the sake of being concise, Sarah Britton is a whole foods genius and I want to shrink down to pocket size so I can ride around in her chef coat pocket and learn everything she knows about holistic cooking. Think she’d mind? (OK, raise your hand if you think riding around in a little pocket would be super fun?!)  Sarah’s taught me a lot about food recently. How medjool dates are best, organic is worth budging for, and cocoa powder is not the same thing as cacao powder, just to name a few. AsSarahexplains, COCOA (koe-koe) powder is cooked which strips it of 90-some percent of its nutrients. However, raw CACAO (kuh-cow) powder is rife with health benefits like calcium, iron, and beta carotene. And it’s one of the top sources of magnesium found in nature. So you see, cocoa and cacao are very different things, which is important to know if you’re shooting for optimum health like I am (trying to) these days.  Unfortunately I was not able to get my hands on raw cacao powder before making these no-bake fudgy brownies, so they are not technically raw. But I have just placed an Amazon order for a bag today so the next time raw brownies appear on this blog they will be so healthy they’ll boast too many health benefits to count. Oh goody. But in the meantime, if you don’t have cacao powder you can make these brownies. And if you DO have cacao powder you can make them, too. Yours will just be healthier. But don’t go rubbing it in our faces or we’ll come and eat all your brownies. And how would you like that? Well, that’s what you get for gloating…  These brownies may not contain any butter, sugar, or flour, but they are some of the best I’ve had. They are moist, rich, dense, full of intense chocolate flavor and a hint of espresso. The walnut chunks make it, in my opinion, but if they’re not your thing leave them out. I’ve already eaten half the batch since making them last week and have another healthy recipe utilizing them coming up later in the week so stay tuned. You don’t want to miss this ooey-gooey chocolaty treat.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-minute-espresso-walnut-brownies/
0,Raw Peanut Butter Patties | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Raw Peanut Butter Patties  Six weeks ago, I was in full-fledged holiday baking mode and my mom joined me one evening for some girl time, Baileys, and coffee and a semi-professional cookie decorating contest. She won, I think, on account of finishing all of her Baileys and half of mine. Touche, Mom. Touche. Over the course of a few hours we dipped pretzels in chocolate, sprinkled peppermint on chocolate bark and crowned peanut butter blossoms with a Hershey’s kiss. And you know what happened next? I practically ate a dozen of everything. I think this is the part where I say, “Hi, my name’s Dana and I have…a cookie problem.”  Good news, though. Since then I haven’t inhaled a tin of chocolate bark, licked gobs of frosting off my fingers or made a game of seeing how many white chocolate pretzel sticks I can stick in my mouth at one time (although, now that I mention it, that sounds like an awesome idea). And it’s not because I’ve had a deep look inside myself and wrestled the will to take control of my raging sweet tooth. It’s because I haven’t had the junk in in my house. It’s that simple. Junk food makes me feel terrible and I’ve been having an increasingly difficult time ignoring my conscience anytime I’m tempted to put something less-than-wholesome in my mouth. (Is this what they call becoming an adult?) After all, we only get so many meals in a day and I want to make sure all of mine count, for good.  Lucky for me these cookies are full-on wholesome. They’re vegan, gluten free and contain no added sugar. Just dates, peanuts, oats, almonds and dark chocolate. They also match the likeness of a popular Girl Scout Cookie, only without all the partially hydrogenated what have yous and high fructose devil syrups.  This is pure hippie dessert heaven. The centers are tender, peanut-y and slightly salty thanks to salted, natural peanut butter (I made mine from scratch), and have just a hint of sweetness from a handful of dates. You could certainly leave them as is for a healthy snack, or you could cover them in dark chocolate to elevate them to dessert status.   Besides being simple to make, these little guys stay forever in the freezer so you can pop one out any time you want for an occasional treat. Alternatively, they’d make great gifts wrapped up all pretty – Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, after all.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/raw-peanut-butter-patties/
0,Dark Chocolate Sweet Potato Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Dark Chocolate Sweet Potato Chips  I’m sure at this point you’re thinking I’ve totally lost my mind. Well in that case, fair enough. But if I could just reach through the screen and hand you one of these chips, one bite in you’d be singing a different tune. These chips are nothing short of a flavor masterpiece.  Ironically, these chips almost didn’t happen. I was dipping other things in chocolate this week – a recipe you’ll find on Saturday – and at the same moment I was pulling some sweet potato rounds out of the oven for a different recipe. But instead of going ahead with my plan of drenching them in almond butter and honey, I decided to dunk them in the dark chocolate instead. WIN. One bite, whoa – we’re goin’ all in.   The chips have the perfect amount of crunch thanks to plenty of time spent roasting in the oven, and a touch of saltiness to offset the sweetness of both the potato and the chocolate. I’m a firm believer in the idea that anything dipped in chocolate is generally a good idea, especially peanut butter things. But sweet potatoes take chocolate dipping to a whole new level. This is one of my best discoveries yet. Friends, behold the new face of chocolate-covered dessert.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/dark-chocolate-sweet-potato-chips/
0,Vegan Ginger Hot Chocolate | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Ginger Hot Chocolate  At first I didn’t think we were going to have a winter this year, which for the record is totally fine with me. I’m more of the sweat over shiver type, even though bundling up in hats and mittens and scarves on top of scarves is one of my favorite pastimes. But then, one day last week,winter did come and I’m still feeling a bit of a chill because of it. Though it only stayed for a brief moment and it’s already back in the 50s, it was still rough. So rough, in fact, that it required a new hot cocoa recipe. One of the ginger variety as you might’ve guessed.  I have this friend named Lacy who loves ginger candies so much she can eat a whole bag before realizing what happened. She also runs marathons a lot. This is why I think she’s crazy. Ginger candy. Honestly, I don’t get it. I popped a giant ginger square in my mouth after hearing Lacy loved it so much and I haven’t stopped regretting it since. Ginger has such a strong, spicy flavor, which is why I prefer it as a complementary flavor, not the main squeeze. After some experimenting I found the perfect role for ginger to play: Ground ginger (or you could sub fresh) went into the hot cocoa itself and a ginger candy was used to line the rim of the serving mug. How perfect. That way every sip has a hint of ginger without being too overwhelming. The result, i think, was quite perfect.  This hot chocolate has a lovely warmth. It’s sweet, creamy and chocolatey and not-too-spicy due to a conservative amount of ginger. But, if you love the stuff like Lacy then by all means, pop a few ginger candies in your mouth while you’re making a batch and throw in a whole teaspoon of ginger instead of half. Go wild, I don’t make the ginger rules, I merely twist them to suit my taste. I do, on the other hand, write the breakfast rules. Don’t, mess, with my breakfast. You have been warned.

0,Vodka Root Beer Floats | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vodka Root Beer Floats with Coconut Ice Cream  {In a deep, sexy baritone} Hey, you. Yeah, you. Why don’t you come over here and enjoy a vodka root beer float with me? Sit down, get to know me, ya know? I know, you’re asking, “why theintroduction?” Andprobably“how do you have such a sexy voice?” To answer the latter first, born with it. Responding to the former, well, my name is John. And John doesn’t usually write the minimalist baker posts. In fact, this is my first one. Usually you get toexperiencethe literary expertise of Dana. Perhaps regretfully, today’s post willforce-feedyou my tone of voice. Or you can just skip to the bottom to read the recipe. That’s what I’d do.  We like dessert, but we try not to overindulge. What’s that mean? It means when we do dessert, we do it right. We rarely drink soda, we stopped eating ice cream often, and it’s a special treat to make a cocktail. Solution? MIX ALL OF THEM. Introducing: Vodka Root Beer Floats! Since we didn’t want to produce something disgusting, we knew testing would be required. And test we did. After hours ofpainstaking labor, we founda flavor combination that was pleasing for any palette. Translation: We mixed liquor with root beer! Hooray for testing!  Our conclusive resultsreturnedthe following: 1) Kahlua – Good, sweet, but fearful it would over power the ice cream flavor. 2) Spiced rum – Extremely good as just a sitting drink, but again, would distract from the sweetness of the ice cream. 3) White rum – Bad idea. Flat out, bad idea. 4) Vodka – BINGO! A subtle, tasty liquor that waltzed with the root beer on my tongue.  Next, we had to locate our ice cream. Thankfully, earlier this week we made dairy-free cinnamon toast ice cream. Haven’t made it yet? It’s worth it. Get the ingredients, find a friend, and make an afternoon out of it.  These were good. Although they were root beer floats, they were also a cocktail. Dana delights in anything sweet. She devoured this. The spoon didn’t leave her hand until it finishedscrapingthe bottom of the glass. I, on the other hand, had the determination to consume the entire drink through my straw. I do the same thing with strawberry milkshakes. The only reward I find is a sore mouth and a two hour eating event. I think it is a pride thing. Regardless, I survived. For you. You’re welcome.

0,Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream (Dairy-Free) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream (Dairy-Free)  Waking up at grandma’s house was always slow. My sister and I would be jostled in the sheets next to each other in the hideaway bed in the living room while my mom and grandma carried on quiet conversation in the kitchen. The sun would start to stream in and we could smell the scent of mediocre coffee with too much cream and equal. When we finally came to we’d take turns in the bathroom doing damage control on our hair and face creases before shuffling into the kitchen. My sister was most often less chipper than I was…I’m a morning person by nature. But grandma’s cinnamon sugar toast always seemed to bring out the morning person in all of us, even the night owls.   After deciding to try a dairy free diet out on January 1, I knew it would be difficult if only for the fact that I would miss ice cream. Whether planned or sporadic, John and I had gotten into the habit of visiting our local dairy/ice creamery at least once every couple weeks to pick up eggs, milk and a double scoop. It’s now been nearly three weeks since I’ve had ice cream and I was starting to fall off my rocker a little bit, so a dairy-free recipe was a must. I’ve experimented with no-churn recipes before and while they’re great for simplicity’s sake, I knew consistency would be key in a non-dairy version. So I ran downstairs and borrowed my friend Laura’s ice cream maker and two cans of coconut milk later I was in business. The cinnamon sugar toast came inspired by my grandma’s favorite breakfast item and one that I often still crave.   I took a tip from the coconut ice cream queen, Oh, Ladycakes on this recipe and kept it very simple. The result was just what I’d hoped for. Though it did taste like coconut, it was rich and creamy and sweet just like regular ice cream. And I adored how the cinnamon sugar and actual toast flecks gave it a whole new flavor dimension. This isn’t a 1-for-1 trade up, but it certainly did the trick in satisfying my ice cream longings.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/cinnamon-toast-ice-cream-dairy-free/

A fluffy, sweet vegan pancake that tastes exactly like a blueberry muffin. Not lying. The basis of this recipe is simple. A basic vegan pancake batter with plump blueberries and a lightly toasted streusel topping. From start to finish, they take about 30 minutes, and it’ll be one of the best half-hour investments in the kitchen you’ve ever made.   When I say they taste exactly like a blueberry streusel muffin, I mean exactly. John can back me up on this one. What’s more? He doesn’t like pancakes – as in nearly detests them – and he ate the entire stack. I gave him a sample bite, and the next thing I knew, he’d run off with them.  These would make a lovely brunch or weekend breakfast item, or something special during the week to lure your kids out of bed with. In writing this post and oogling at the photos once more, I’ve decided to make them again tomorrow. Yes, muffin pancakes for breakfast on a Wednesday – sounds like a brilliant plan to me.   Nutritionally speaking these are a bit on the indulgent side, but if you split the stack in two it’s plenty to satisfy a sweet tooth. I’ve included the nutritional estimate for the whole stack below.

0,Ginger Cookies with Orange Buttercream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Ginger Cookie Sandwiches with Orange Buttercream  In the land of cookie sandwiches there are three distinct sizes: the Little Debbie, the tea time, and the fat kid. These, my friends, are the fat kid.  This recipe combines two of my favorite things: Chewy ginger cookies and sweet citrus frosting. Thought they don’t fit my current dairy-free bill, I made them a while back for a party I attended and were mostly devoured by fellow guests. I made some with modest amounts of frosting and others with obscene amounts. Guess which ones went first? OBSCENE. Fat kids are popular, what can I say?  Not only are these cookie sandwiches fun to look at, they’re also quite delectable. Fluffy orange-flavored buttercream makes the perfect glue between two chewy ginger cookies. The flavor combo just works. Plus, they’re quite simple to throw together, requiring just one bowl and about 30 minutes to prepare. This is a the kind of party favor I can get behind.  If you’re not a fan of the cookie sandwich, simply top each single cookie with a touch of the frosting. Or, if frosting makes you gag, simply opt out of it altogether (who ARE you?).

0,Peanut Butter and Jelly Smoothie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Date Smoothie  Dairy-free, dairy-free, dairy-free – I can do this. If I say it enough times, will it work? I hope so – my digestive health depends on it.  Most of the smoothies I’ve made in the past have contained some form of whey protein powder or yogurt, making them a no-go for me while I’m on my dairy-free test run. This recipe was an experiment of sorts. One recent morning I fumbled around the kitchen in my jammers to see if I could get a creamy texture without any dairy and it was a total score. I think the jammies helped.  PB&amp;J has always been one of my favorite flavor combinations, ever since I was a kiddo eating a triangle cut sandwich with eyes locked on a TV playing Woody the Woodpecker. And this smoothie is a a refreshing presentation of that. Dates and bananas provide natural sweetness, blueberries plenty of of antioxidants, peanut butter protein and healthy fat, and flaxseed fiber and omega 3s. The almond milk adds virtually zero calories and a dreamy amount of creaminess. One sip in and I knew it was a win. I see this smoothie happening many more mornings in 2013. After all, if I can have a PB&amp;J twice in one day, why wouldn’t I? Psh, that’s what I thought.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peanut-butter-jelly-date-smoothie/
0,Apple Streusel Breakfast Pizzas (Dairy-Free) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Apple Streusel Breakfast Pizzas (Dairy-Free)  My dad used to hate buying Lactaid milk for me as a kid. He only told me that recently, but I found it quite humorous, especially considering he never confronted me on the issue as a kindergartner. Of our small family of four, I was the only lactose-intolerant schmuck while the rest of the group was fine with 2%, seemingly ruining the party for all dairy-loving members. “Ice cream, everyone? Well, almost everyone…?” My digestive tract simply hated me, and my special needs didn’t stop there.  I was also severely allergic to cats and everything outdoors. I required allergy shots, medications and endless doctors visits where I’d sit in the waiting room and get my hands locked in a Chinese finger trap, more than once. I couldn’t swallow pills so my mom had to budge for more expensive liquids – another event my dad detested. I had the worst teeth of anyone ever – each tooth proudly facing its own unique direction – which required retainers on top of braces on top of retainers just to make me an acceptable member of society again. I also cried every day in the 4th grade because I missed my mom and hated my new school in the middle of nowhere rural America, far from my familiar New Mexican surroundings. Oh, and I had asthma, but let’s not even go down that road. There was a lot of wheezing, inhalers, breathing chambers, and treatments; rather a sad sight from anyone’s perspective.  Somewhere between braces, freshman basketball and community college I dropped the lactose intolerant bit, almost like how I stopped wearing glasses in 2009 to force my eyes to get better. My eyes obeyed, my stomach did not, and it’s been fighting with me on dairy quite angrily for a couple years now. I was intolerant of my very own intolerance and, like moldy cheese in the back of your fridge,it came back to bite me. I should’ve been tending to this years ago, but I’m fixing that now; or at least trying. Better late than never, I suppose.  In 2013, I’m resolving to listen to my body more, feed it foods it agrees with and leave things like dairy by the wayside, at least temporarily. This recipe may not be the equivalent of a salad in terms of health, but it is dairy-free and healthier than your average pie. Those are two things my stomach can get behind at the moment.  Breakfast pizzas are typically savory but I prefer them sweet. This one consists of a simple pizza dough (store bought or homemade; I include a recipe below), baked apples, a raw-sugar streusel and dairy-free vanilla glaze. John and I snacked on these one lazy afternoon this week and couldn’t help but liken them to the dessert pizzas you’ll find in any American pizza stand, only way better. They’re fresher, more wholesome and embarrassingly simple to make. These would make an excellent weekend treat, brunch item or late-afternoon or after-dinner dessert. I prefer them any time of the day, like most things covered in glaze and baked apples.  So here’s to a New Year. Here’s to resolutions both small and grand. Here’s to health and happiness in 2013. And here’s to another delicious and simple recipe that’s certainly worth sharing. At the risk of sounding cliche, cheers!   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/apple-streusel-breakfast-pizzas-dairy-free/
0,Almond Joy Nut Butter (GF & V) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Joy Butter  Of all of the candy bars in candy bar land Almond Joys may be my least favorite, but hear me out. The flavor combination of chocolate, coconut and almond is simply delectable – it just doesn’t belong in a terribly processed sugar bomb (no offense, candy makers). No, it was meant for better things, so it was a no-brainier to turn it into a creamy, dreamy, buttery spread. The candy bar, though? I’ll definitely still pass.    Ever since I learned how to make almond butter at home it’s been one of the main staples in my diet. I probably make a batch every 2-3 weeks to keep my supply well stocked and while the traditional roasted, salted varieties are lovely, I was ready for some variety. Being that chocolate and coconut are two of my most favorite flavors, the two just collided with almonds in one beautiful sloppy, sweet, savory mess. Friends, I think I’m in love.   This recipe is so simple to throw together, requiring less than 30 minutes, 5 ingredients and 1 spoon (or spatula). Less mess, more time to do what you please – that’s my philosophy. Beyond being easy to make, this spread is incredibly versatile. I lather it on my toast in the mornings, serve it alongside my carrots and apples, and even eat it right out of the jar. I can only imagine how sensational it would be atop pancakes or inside the little squares of a well-crafted waffle. *shudder* – I’m getting weak just thinking about it.

0,Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Bites | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Bites Well hello! I thought I’d drop in and share a little treat to keep the New Year’s good health juju going. Let’s be honest, we can all use as much help as we can get and this recipe is one designed to please the masses (unless you’re my sister who hates bananas – how are we even related?). I love banana bread, you love banana bread, everyone loves chocolate, and we could all use another healthy snack in our rotation, right? See, things are working out in the New Year after all. Told you, naysayers.   These little gems are fluffier than banana cookies but denser than banana bread, putting them somewhere right in between on texture. However, the flavor of banana bread is ever-present and the chocolate chips help give them that extra special “treat” feel, like “I’m eating a cookie, this is so awesome.” See how awesome things just got? That escalated quickly. Ever since her royal Ladycakes gifted me a bottle of her homemade vanilla extractwhen John and I visited her in December, I’ve been itching to use it. This is the first recipe I’ve tried it in and was super pleased (seriously you guys, check it out).The batter in itself is quite wholesome, featuring oats, whole wheat flour, flax seed, and maple syrup or agave as a natural sweetener. These little bites make an ideal vegan breakfast on-the-go or take-along snack. I, however, preferred the “shovel as many into my mouth as I can in one sitting” approach. You know, for sampling purposes and such. Enjoy, I really, really hope you do.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/chocolate-chip-banana-bread-bites/
0,Broiled Romaine Salad with Caesar Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Broiled Romaine Salad with Rosemary Caesar Dressing  One too many sugar cookies. Finished off the last third of that pie. Snuck 3 pieces of peanut butter fudge when no one was looking. We know. Us too. That’s why we made you a salad.Now come here and cry on mama’s shoulder.  Solution: fancy romaine salad with homemade Caesar dressing. If you’ve never tried grilled romaine salad you’re missing out on a serious treat. I was the last person to expect it would be such a fantastically different flavor experience than fresh romaine, but it truly is. Something about the way the searing hot grill kisses the olive-oil brushed leaves just takes it to a whole new level of awesome. But you don’t need a grill for this recipe – we pop it under the broiler instead for a similarly stellar result.   Simply wash and dry the prettiest looking leaves in your bunch – the closer to the center the better – toss them lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper, and then pop them under the broiler for a few minutes, rotating once to ensure even cooking. Then, top with this super simple rosemary Caesar dressing and some fresh shaved Parmesan.  This salad is more special in taste and texture than a traditional romaine salad, making it perfect for entertaining. And the dressing adds a creamy, spicy punch. This dish could easily be considered an entree if you bulked it up with some grilled chicken, roasted veggies or toasted nuts. Plus, if you make it for all your friends they’ll be super impressed. Three points for the classy hostess.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/broiled-romaine-salad-with-rosemary-caesar-dressing/
0,Pomegranate Lime Spritzers | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pomegranate Lime Spritzers  This time last year this blog didn’t exist. I was working at a coffee shop in a city I despised, John was only halfway through law school – which he hated – and ‘our life’ as we’d planned it just wasn’t where we’d hoped. The funny thing is, our circumstances were all a result of decisions we had made, whether actively or passively. And despite our careful planning and forethought, we simply weren’t happy with the direction we were headed.We all know what you’re supposed to do in these situations: Remain positive and keep putting one foot in front of the other even if the road ahead appears grim. But on New Year’s Eve of 2011, we did just the opposite.  As we sat in our third-story one bedroom apartment with our blinds open, listening to the sound of rain tick the sides of our building and fireworks go off in the distance, we talked about our lives: what we wanted, what we didn’t want, what it would take to get there, what was holding us back, and if it was possible to achieve. The conversation was one of the best we’d had yet, one that honestly changed the trajectory of our lives as a married couple and as individuals possibly forever. That night we decided if we don’t like something we change it, and if there’s something we want to do – be it as small as starting a website or as big as traveling the world – we find a way to do it.From the outside looking in, we look like crazy people sometimes. But if we’re doing what we love, does it really matter? We’ve realized it’s extremely important to ask yourself – and ask often – what it is you really want to be doing with your day, your week, your life, otherwise you drift, begin reacting instead of enacting, and never really end up where you want to be. If you want something bad enough you can make it happen, you just have to remove the distractions and find a way. After all, if your happiness is at stake is there really any other option? One year later we are leaps and bounds closer to where we want to be. John graduates from law school in May – thank God; I balance my time between writing, cooking and photography; and we have our eyes set on where we want to be in the next few years. Honestly, it feels amazing, liberating and totally worth raising a glass to. I can’t wait to see what 2013 brings. If we make half the progress we made in 2012, I can only expect it to be awesome. So cheers to a New Year, and thanks in advance for celebrating with us in 2013. Here’s one seriously fine cocktail to kick things off.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/pomegranate-lime-spritzers/
0,White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whole Wheat White Chocolate Cranberry Cookies with Sea Salt  My favorite cookie has always been white chocolate macadamia nut but this recipe takes the obsession to a whole new level. Plus, it’s made with wheat flour so they’re practically health food. You’re welcome, Santa.  These cookies are about as simple as they come: 30 minutes from start to finish and one bowl required, meaning minimal effort and clean up. That’s my kind of cookie.   I can’t help but suggest these are the perfect cookie to leave behind for Santa because they’re slightly heartier thanks to whole wheat pastry flour and are a nice break from the usual chocolate chip. Plus, the berries make them festive. I believe I’ve made my case.  Oh man these were so good, for breakfast even! (Sshhh, I won’t tell.) Buttery, slightly crisp, moist, white chocolate chips in every bite with an occasional bright, tart note from the cranberries. Friends, this is cookie simplicity at its finest.

0,Overnight Honey Wheat Cinnamon Rolls | Minimalist Baker,"Overnight Honey Wheat Cinnamon Rolls  Ever thought cinnamon rolls were the most labor intensive baked good ever? Yeah me too, until this recipe came along.  You know what else? These rolls are perfect for Christmas, which I intend to celebrate joyfully this year – twinkly lights, homemade ornaments and ooey gooey cinnamon rolls all in tow.  I wanted to share a Christmas morning recipe that took the stress off Christmas Day and shifted it to the night before – you know, when Santa and his elves are churning. Seems like an appropriate time to be cranking out Christmas goodies, eh? These rolls are simpler than most because they’re prepped the night before and require one mixing bowl for the entire process. All that’s left to do in the morning is a quick rise, preheat, bake, glaze and voila: breakfast is served. Now all that’s left to do is open presents and lounge. Sheesh, life is rough.   I included two glazes because I believe options are not only a privilege but a right, says the girl who mixes three cereals and two milks in every bowl. I preferred the vanilla but I guess I’m somewhat of a cinnamon roll purist if there ever was such a thing. However, the bourbon caramel glaze is just as temping and you probably already have some on hand if you whipped up a batch when I shared the recipe two weeks back. If you didn’t, well, you should. It requires just 4 ingredients, 15 minutes and will probably change your life.   These babies were absolute perfection and more healthy than the average roll thanks to whole wheat pastry flour and limited butter. They are sturdy but moist, just sweet enough with the brown sugar-cinnamon filling, and perfectly frosted for that optimum bite with each fork full. Gee, I could’ve devoured three…or maybe I did. In any case, I hope your holiday celebrations are grand! Merry (early) Christmas from our little nook to yours. Now let’s all get cozy with some honey wheat cinnamon rolls, shall we? I was hoping you’d say yes.    ",https://minimalistbaker.com/overnight-honey-wheat-cinnamon-rolls/
0,Chewy Double Chocolate Peppermint Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chewy Double Chocolate Peppermint Cookies  Sometime between December 1st and now I was hit by a severe craving for chocolate and peppermint, and friends this is rare as I expressed in my 5-Ingredient Peppermint Mocha Frappe post. I used to be a chocolate-mint hater but now we have a growing love affair. Thankfully this recipe satisfies my deepest chocolate peppermint cravings, perhaps just as much as a double scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Ughghghg, so good.   It is Christmas after all so that means it’s time for baking. I come from a long line of bakers, my mom, aunts and grandmothers included. My Grandma Sally makes a mean peanut brittle, my aunts are pie extraordinaires, and my mom taught me the art of making the perfect peanut butter blossom. All of these things ring Christmas to me so it’s natural for me to hover around the kitchen a bit more in December. It’s in my blood.   These cookies may look a little complicated but they’re actually very simple. Just 30 minutes from start to finish and prepared all in one bowl. I hate having to get out loads of ingredients and multiple bowls just as much as the next person so this cookie has been whittled down to the bare bone necessities. However, it doesn’t lack that perfect cookie texture, or luscious chocolate peppermint flavor one bit. Ask my coworkers who literally downed the whole batch by 10 a.m. after I dropped them in the break room. I guess you could say they were a little popular. I think Santa would approve.   I ate my cookie as is but I bet they’d also be great frozen and dipped in milk like Thin Mints (oh my gosh those are so good). I also suspect they’d make the perfect partner to hot cocoa or crumbled into a vanilla or mint milkshake (that would be the end of me). The possibilities are endless.   Simple factor: 30 minutes from start to finish; prepared using 1 bowl ",https://minimalistbaker.com/chewy-double-chocolate-peppermint-cookies/
0,Whole Wheat Griddle Cakes with Fruit Compote | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Whole Wheat Griddle Cakes with Blueberry Orange Compote  It doesn’t get much better than a warm stack of pancakes on a weekend morning. I’ve loved them ever since I was a wee Dana and they were the only thing my mom could coax me out of bed with in the morning before school. It may have been pitch black outside and my body was fighting with all its might to remain at rest, but if I knew there was a hot stack of pancakes waiting for me I would somehow muster the energy to get to the breakfast table – sometimes crawling. Well this is embarrassing, but when I was in grade school I was such a morning hater that my mom used to bundle me up in my blanket and carry me – yes carry me – to the kitchen where I’d sit slumped over on a breakfast bar stool. This proves three things: 1) my 5 foot 2 inch mother is saint, 2) I was an extremely spoiled child, and 3) pancakes have always been there for me.  These pancakes are less like a traditional pan- “cake” and more of a griddle cake, which is defined as “a flat cake of thin batter fried on both sides on a griddle.” They’re similar to a pancake but the batter is thinner and they’re not as sweet – more hearty, if you will. Plenty of whole wheat flour, oats, a touch of butter and sugar, an egg, and some buttermilk. These are about as minimalist as they come, just the way I like it.   And the compote? Amazing. Warm blueberries with orange juice and zest and a touch of sugar. I considered adding an herb but it just didn’t seem right. When you have a good thing going don’t be tempted to throw in more “things” just for the sake of being exotic. Sometimes all you need are the basics (most of the time as far as I’m concerned).   How do they taste? These griddle cakes are all kinds of delicious – light in texture, slightly less fluffy than a pancake, not overly sweet and seriously satisfying. The blueberry orange compote is the perfect addition to make this a complete meal. Syrup is certainly optional, but if it’s the weekend, I say go for it.

0,Creamy Brussels Sprouts and Shallot Dip | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Brussels Sprout &amp; Shallot Dip  Oh dear, how do I explain myself? Well, I’ve always loved spinach and artichoke dip and upon my more recent discovery that I love Brussels sprouts I grew curious of what they’d be like in a dip. One shallot, two cloves of garlic, and healthy dose of cheese later and here we are: holiday appetizer dip at its finest. Everybody’s tired of the spinach and artichoke variety anyways, right?  This dip is absolutely dreamy. I sautéed minced garlic, shallot, and roughly chopped brussels sprouts for a few minutes, then mixed cream cheese, sour cream, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese together in a separate bowl. Next I blended the two together, baked it until it was all warm and bubbly and voila: Creamy Brussels Sprout and Shallot Dip. So easy and so delicious. Just 9 ingredients and one mixing bowl required. This dip would be perfect with crunchy veggies, toasted bread, crackers or pita chips, but I especially loved it with yellow corn tortilla chips. The salt-on-salt combo was to die for. Take our landlord’s word for it – I gave her a sample and she asked for the recipe after the first bite. And John even liked it and he’s not typically a fan of strange alien-looking green things. What can I say? This dip is legit. Serve it at your holiday parties, social gatherings or as a classy appetizer on a special night in. You simply won’t regret it.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/creamy-brussels-sprout-shallot-dip/
0,Peppermint Mocha Frappe with Coconut Milk | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peppermint Mocha Frappe with Coconut Milk  I used to be an absolute mint-chocolate hater. Anything containing any semblance of that flavor combination sent me running, especially when it came to desserts. No, I wouldn’t like any peppermint patties, thank you very much. But then, something happened. I don’t know if it was the Andes mint that won me over, the multiple times I’d watched my boss’s husband slurp down a mint chocolate chip shake looking sublimely at peace, or the one time I was desperate for ice cream and the only flavor my aunt had on hand was mint chip and I maybe kind of slightly enjoyed it a little bit but didn’t want to admit it. Yes, something changed. Now mint, chocolate and I are like besties. Like Lianne La Havas, winged eyeliner and a Danelectro guitar. Ever since giving it a second chance this summer on a random trip to Braum’s, I now get one scoop of coffee chocolate chunk and one scoop of mint chocolate chip every time; and then off I go on my merry way.   This chilled coffee beverage is quite a delight and SO easy to make! Coconut milk ice cubes make a creamy simple base, strong brewed coffee adds a nice morning kick (ours is home roasted), creamy chocolate syrup and cocoa powder add the mocha punch, and natural peppermint extract gives the whole thing a delightful minty feel. Yep, I’m a total fan of this frappe: Cool, creamy, chocolatey, minty and plenty of caffeine. I don’t know what else I’d add! Oh yeah, whipped cream and fresh mint! Go wild. It is the holidays after all.   This would make a perfect breakfast companion, afternoon treat or evening dessert. You could even add a shot of Kahlua or Bailey’s to give it an extra kick. Any way you serve it you really can’t go wrong.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peppermint-mocha-frappe-with-coconut-milk/
0,Gluten-Free Bourbon Caramel Samoas | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Bourbon Caramel Samoas  There’s something about being rooted in community that just feels right, but you don’t realize how important that is until it’s no longer there. Over the summer I began to reflect on this. John and I have lived in three cities in the nearly three years we’ve been married and have moved nearly twice that amount in the meantime. While that has allowed us to latch onto and let go of several new friends in our life, it’s left me with an almost eerie sense of not knowing who my community is at any given time and where I belong. When I start to feel a bit estranged in this world I begin to feel like my piece of the island has broken off from the big island and I’m floating off into the sea, all by myself, disconnected, adrift and hardly known by anyone but myself. And some days I’m not even so certain of that last part. But the good news is I can always make change where I see necessary. In most cases healthy, positive change is just one conversation or perspective shift away. The change I needed was to make new community where we’ve currently laid roots. I don’t know how long we’ll be here but for the time that we are here, I want to be present and intentional with the people around us. So John and I did the best thing we knew how to foster that community feel: We invited people over for dinner.   Close to 15 of our dearest friends from various settings including high school, work, church, and other random life events filled our humble little studio apartment one recent evening and it all felt so right; like a big hug from that favorite aunt you haven’t seen in years. I provided the essentials: Two batches of chili, cornbread (gluten free and non) and these gluten free cookies. Wine, laughter and plenty of dirty dishes soon followed.   At one point my friend and wedding photographer Rebecca leaned over and mentioned that the cookies reminded her of Girl Scout Caramel Delights or Samoas. They had all the essential elements but were just missing the caramel and chocolate coating to give them that finishing touch. I didn’t think much of it then but when I recalled I had a batch of my bourbon caramel sauce tucked away in my fridge I knew gluten-free Samoas needed to be born. Since then I’ve made these several times each with positive results and resounding feedback. I gave my (gluten-free) friend Laura a small batch one night and she devoured them all in a matter of minutes before my eyes. I believe the adjective she kept using was “uuhhhmaaayyzzing.” Needless to say I think we found her (and my) new favorite cookie recipe.   These cookies may lack the abundance of flour, butter and sugar of traditional Samoas, but they in no way lack the flavor and definitive texture of the real thing. These are a must make not only for the holidays but for all your special gatherings in between. Gluten free decadence has never tasted so good.

0,4-Ingredient Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"4-Ingredient Bourbon Caramel Sauce  Several months back I received an email from Joanna at Cup of Jo asking if I’d like to participate in her “Best __ Ever” series. This delicious series seeks to present the best recipe for classic dishes like hummus, chocolate ice cream and brownies. Given the choice of a dozen or so categories, my eyes were immediately drawn to the Best Sundae Ever pick, as ice cream is my all time favorite food. Ask John, he can vow that seldom three days pass before I’m aching for a double scoop. (Lucky for me, he always delivers.)  Though my deadline was weeks away I began brainstorming and dreamt up the perfect recipe: One scoop each of chocolate and vanilla ice cream from a local dairy in the Midwest, sliced bananas, chocolate syrup, homemade caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream and crushed salted peanuts. This combination, I thought, hit on salty and sweet and was altogether satisfying. I’m here to tell you my friends, it was. Wanting to include an aspect that was unique, homemade and of course, simple, I decided on making caramel from scratch. If you’ve never made caramel from scratch it’s incredibly easy. This recipe (shared on Cup of Jo as well) requires just four ingredients and 15 minutes of your time and the result is a sinfully delicious and decadent bourbon caramel sauce that is perfect for topping sundaes, cookies, cakes, pies, crisps and everything in between.

0,Noodle Bowl with Ginger Peanut Dressing | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Asian Noodle Bowl with Ginger Peanut Dressing  I kind of have a thing for noodle bowls, especially this one since it satisfies virtually all the requirements I look for in a meal: Quick, easy, flavorful, healthy and satisfying. Plus, this dish provides both heat from sriracha and fresh green onion and sweet from a creamy ginger peanut sauce. Friends, this is delicious simplicity at its finest.  The concept is simple: Prepare rice noodles, chop up fresh veggies of your choice (I prefer carrots and green onions), add in some protein (like tofu), fresh herbs (basil is my jam) and whisk up a quick dressing and throw it all together. It’s so incredibly filling and requires just 10-15 minutes of your time. It’s also vegan and gluten free, and for our peanut butter-adverse friends, simply sub in cashew butter or tahini. Finally, something we can ALL enjoy totally guilt free.  I typically make this style of dish for dinner, but add a sauce to the noodles and do a pad thai spin-off. But this fresh version is so light and refreshing and definitely hits the spot mid-day. However, it would make an excellent mid-week meal since it requires little time and thought and can be assembled buffet style so even picky eaters get what they want.  The peanut dressing is what makes this dish: Peanut butter, toasted sesame oil, honey, soy sauce, lime, ginger, chili garlic sauce and hot water. These ingredients can be found at any Asian market and for super cheap. At the market right up the way from our house I score giant bottles of Sriracha for like $2, packs of noodles for $1 and huge bags of basil for 69 cents. SIXTY NINE CENTS! Healthy and cheap?

0,Crispy Baked Rosemary Garlic Fries | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Crispy Baked Rosemary Garlic Fries  This recipe comes with two stories: One, how we happened upon a bustling rosemary pant for just $2.50. And two, how we found a new restaurant in downtown Wichita that feels nothing like Kansas and everything like Portland, Oregon. Two terrific discoveries if you ask us.  First, the rosemary. I instagrammed a photo of our new herbs a couple weeks back and here’s a more flattering portrait of one of our new beauties. We’ve had basil for a while, which was a gift from friends that I use quite often in Thai and Italian dishes. But you can’t go wrong with more herbs. So when John and I were in our local Fresh Market a couple weeks back we saw an amazing deal: 2 herb plants for $5! I couldn’t believe it, and they looked so fresh. We instantly snagged a mint and rosemary and proceeded to the checkout to claim our prizes. The rest, as they say, is history.  The second part of this recipe is the inspiration behind it. We discovered this new restaurant in Wichita called Public that’s so rad we’ve literally been there three times already, purchased two Groupons for meals, and are going there tonight after we finish Christmas shopping. Though I could say a lot about it, we love that they are committed to using fresh, local ingredients (a rarity in Kansas); serving creative and inspired dishes; and have daily $2 beer specials. Also, the owner used to live in Seattle, a city we’re quite fond of, and follows us on Twitter and totally RECOGNIZED us on our first visit. John and I have NEVER been recognized in public for Minimalist Baker, being that we’re such a young site (born just in June 2012). Needless to say we were flattered, impressed and are now hooked on this amazing new place.  On our first night there we invited a couple friends down and we split the rosemary garlic fries. I honestly wasn’t expecting anything amazing but one bite in and I was literally having a slow-motion intimate moment with that french fry. It was clearly hand cut, perfectly salted and studded with fresh pieces of minced garlic and rosemary. How very creative and delicious. So delicious, in fact, that once the fries were gone I was literally picking the rosemary out of the bottom of the bowl and putting it directly in my mouth. It was all over from there. I set off to recreate the recipe that very next day.  See how it all comes together? We discovered Public which led us to the rosemary which led us to this very recipe: a crispy baked french fry seasoned with fresh garlic and rosemary that’s casual enough to serve with a burger and sophisticated enough to serve to the snobbiest of foodies in your social circle.

But it can’t always be in the form of a double dipped cone from DQ (guilty), an entire dark chocolate bar (I’ve done that once or thrice) or a fat slice of chocolate cake (oh lordy, yes). Else, we might just become that fat slice of cake, and we don’t want that (we don’t right? OK, just checking…).  Friends, I have a solution. Rich chocolate truffles with plenty of decadent flavor and a hint of spice thanks to cayenne, nutmeg and cinnamon. Dates bring it all together and make it sweet. Sweet, spicy, chocolaty – I think we have all the bases covered, right?   These vegan truffles were inspired by the most adorable person on earth, Ashlae from Oh, Lady Cakes. I stumbled upon her blog a few months back and promptly sent her an email titled “friend request” that expressed how fabulous I thought she and her blog were, specifically her raw cacao ice cream. She replied just hours later saying “…thank you for not writing to tell me how terrible it is that I think it’s OK for people to consume 500-calorie bowls of ice cream. WHO FREAKING COUNTS CALORIES??!?!?!! The nerve of some people, I tell you what.” We’ve been fast friends ever since.   These vegan truffles were certainly inspired by her lovely Lady Cakes (was that inappropriate?). She had me at raw. Then she threw in cacao and then slayed me with truffle. I simply added some coffee and spice. Try them both ways, they’re quite delicious either way, I tell you what.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/raw-mayan-truffles/
0,Pumpkin Scones with Maple & Molasses Glaze | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Scones with Maple and Molasses Glaze  There are certain things about my personality that I will forever want to change but simply cannot. For instance, I will never shake my inability to become a night person no matter how late I rise. I will never be able to focus on what anyone else is saying unless it’s about food, coupons or something I said earlier. I hate that I cannot recall details for anything or remember once and for all that bangs are not for me. Greasy foreheads and fringe cuts don’t mix, seriously. I don’t like that I turn up my nose at criticism, that I have no self control around cake and ice cream (no literally, none), and rush through things often overlooking the details. But the one thing that really bugs me about myself (did I really just say that?) is that I have to be reminded far too often of what I’m working toward in life, what I’m passionate about, and what I’m good at. It’s like if someone (usually my husband) doesn’t come along and hit my ‘reset’ button, I go straight into couch potato mode perceiving myself as incapable of doing anything right and consequently never leaving my pajamas and moping audibly most hours of the day. Seriously, what is wrong with me?   OK, I know. This is awkward and I’m being too hard on myself. It’s like you’re sitting in on my own personal roast. But I’m getting somewhere, because one of the things that I do like about myself is my ability to look inward, see yucky stuff and want to purge it and make a change. Sure, that may be an ability that many people have, but when you actually do it it feels so good that you just have to share about it to remind yourself and maybe others of how healthy the act is. How healthy it is to say I don’t have it all right, I mess up a lot, and I am the epitome of imperfection. But, but-tutut, I can do some things right and others really well. I just have to remember that from time to time or else Mopey McPj Pants re-emerges and sucks the life and creativity right out of me. Egh, I hate that chick; so inconsiderate.  Mmmm, what does that have to do with scones? A lot really. Because these scones came to be the day after I had one of these mini realizations. They, in themselves, represent my cognitive ability to turn on the light bulb when things are getting dim. And, not to mention, they’re pretty dang tasty, too.   This all ties in (sort of) with a little quote I jotted down earlier this week while reading Augustine’s Confessions (yes, this is my idea of light reading). Even though it’s taken a bit out of context, it still applies here. That even if no one notices what you’re doing you should focus on finding joy in the things you love to do. For me, this week, it was making these scones no matter how feeble an accomplishment they may be. Because they were something – a delicious, delicious something – of which I am very proud of.

0,Creamy Pumpkin Pie | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pumpkin Pie  I know, I know. It’s Thanksgiving Day and I’m kind of late to the pumpkin pie party. But this one was totally worth the wait: chilled with a crunchy graham cracker crust, cream cheese and pumpkin pudding layers, all topped off with whipped cream and toasted coconut. Need I say more? By the way, happy Turkey Day from Minimalist Baker!  This is a recipe that’s been passed down in my family, starting with my aunts to my mom and then to my sister and I. Now, consider it yours. It’s my absolute favorite pumpkin pie because it has a crunch from the graham cracker crust, a lightly sweetened cream cheese layer followed by a perfectly creamy pumpkin pudding layer, and it’s all topped off with a healthy dose of whipped cream. It literally does not get better than this.  I loved this dessert so much as a young girl that my Aunt Donna used to make me my own separate pie so I could have one all to myself at both Thanksgiving and Christmas! How ridiculous is that? Thinking back, my aunt either did this because A) she wanted to fatten my string bean self up, B) she truly did love me like a daughter, OR C) I was causing dissension at Thanksgiving by claiming 3/4 of the pie before dinner even started. All three good reasons if you ask me. Either way, I scored an entire pie out of the deal.  The other awesome part about this pie because the fact that it’s insanely delicious? It’s so, so simple to put together. No baking required if you buy a pre-made graham cracker crust. Even if you already have a pumpkin pie recipe in mind this Thanksgiving, why not make a second? I hear pie goes fast around the dinner table, at least in my family (wink, wink).   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/creamy-pumpkin-pie/
0,Coconut Chocolate Chip Almond Meal Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Almond Meal Cookies with Chocolate Chips and Coconut  A month or so back I stumbled upon blog so lovely I immediately became enamored. The name, Sprouted Kitchen. The mission, to make whole foods tasty. The pair behind the movement, husband and wife Sara and Hugh Forte – cook and photographer, respectively. Consider me hooked, hence the reason I hopped over to Amazon mere moments after discovering their site and snatched up a copy of their new cookbook. This is my humble attempt at honoring the amazing work Sarah and Hugh have put forth in this stunning book that has now become my constant cooking companion, favorite coffee table book, and source of light reading on the weekends (all three true statements).  I love Sprouted Kitchen because it’s not trying to be anything, per say, besides honest. It’s not trying to secure the market on gluten free cakes or sneak spinach into brownies or make you give up meat. It’s simply presenting whole foods in a beautiful, simple way and making them damn delicious in the process. Proof? These gluten-free cookies that require just a few ingredients (that’s my kind of recipe) and contain three of my favorite flavors: chocolate, coconut and almond.   John and I had a few friends over for dinner last week and as we were expecting a few gluten-free eaters, I knew these cookies would be just the thing to bake. I had everything on hand except coconut flake, which I walked a block or so over to our local specialty foods purveyor (Nifty Nut House) to grab a pound or so of. While there I also managed to snag a “sample” of a double dipped dark chocolate malt ball – an object so large it hardly warrants the title of sample and more like small feast. Either way, I headed back to our place, the Kansas wind whipping my hair in all directions, coconut clutched in my hand and a happy chocolate-coated malt ball belly in tow. Life was good.   I was so excited to make these cookies – my first recipe to try from Sprouted Kitchen – that I think I literally squealed out loud while gathering my ingredients. Three things I loved about this recipe: It was simple, healthy and quick to prepare; not to mention it yielded some seriously amazing chocolate chip cookies that any eater – gluten-free or not – would be pleased to pick up (yes, the cookie platter was plumb empty halfway through our dinner party). So thank you Sara for dreaming up such delicious, wholesome recipes and sharing them on Sprouted Kitchen. And thank you Hugh for capturing it all with your impeccable photography skills. I suspect these cookies – and your cookbook – will be warming my little home and my heart for a long time to come. Cheers.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/coconut-chocolate-chip-almond-meal-cookies/
0,Vegan Gluten-Free Apple Crisp Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Gluten-Free Vegan Apple Crisp  I know it’s basically the holiday season at this point and all but I still have to tell you this fabulous story about why I absolutely HAD to make this gluten-free vegan apple crisp on Halloween. We have some pretty amazing friends in our life right now and John and I LOVE getting together with them often to chat and laugh and eat delicious food. Well, two out of the six of our group are gluten-free eaters and another two of us are borderline vegan eaters (guilty as charged), but you just can’t go without apple crisp in the fall. You just can’t. Am I right? So I buckled down and did some research (and snagged some gluten-free flour from my friend Rebecca’s pantry) and came up with a delicious way to satisfy everyone’s appetites and dietary needs with one warm, sweet apple crispy dish. Ta-da!   This apple crisp is about as simple and basic as they come, and though it’s vegan and gluten-free it’s just as delicious as any traditional version I’ve tried. Armed with non-dairy butter (Earth Balance, how I love thee), it’s totally dairy-free. And thanks to almond meal, gluten-free oats, and a gluten-free flour blend, it’s also void of the glutens. Good riddance, food allergies. Good riddance.  Wondering what it tastes like? Warm, sweet apples, plenty of warm spice from the cinnamon, and the crispy, crumbly oat topping is just the bee’s knees. Top it with some non-dairy ice cream (or dairy, if that’s your thang) and dig in. Fall has never been so darn delicious (or healthy), I’m convinced.

0,Sweet Potato Parmesan Gratin | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Sweet Potato Parmesan Gratin  I write this post on a full belly, the best kind of belly if you ask me. I dined on leftover pancakes and a chocolate breakfast shake and it’s approximately 11:45 a.m. The fact is, when you work at home some days you don’t wake up until 8:30 and you don’t shower until 10, which means you don’t have coffee ’til 11 and simply are not hungry for breakfast until noon. But if you ask me, what’s the big deal? My belly got fed either way…   Speaking of full bellies, this sweet potato gratin gave me a full belly. Sliced sweet potatoes with one wee little yellow potato in the mix, sprinkled with a touch of thyme, lots of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and baked to perfection – this is the breakfast, brunch, lunch, snack of champions.   I love how simple this dish is to throw together. It’s rustic in nature: loosely sliced sweet potatoes, a touch of salt, pepper and thyme, fresh grated cheese and a splash of milk. Throw her in the oven for an hour or so and you have a stunning and tasty dish on your hands. I personally prefer mine as an addition to lunch, but it also would be perfect alongside eggs or fruit for breakfast or as an afternoon snack. The best part? It’s good hot, warm and room temperature meaning it’s a no-fuss kind of meal. If you haven’t guessed by now, that’s my kind of meal.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-parmesan-gratin/
0,Creamy Breakfast Chocolate Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Chocolate Breakfast Shake  Late one night last week, while John was getting ready for bed, I was scouring Pinterest on my iPhone. Some days, I barely pin anything at all on Pinterest, and others, I’m an absolute maniac, re-pinning everything I see. Cute puppies, strange tattoos, 18-layer cakes – you name it. This particular night, I found something that really caught my eye, so much so that I was determined to make it the very next morning. The recipe I’m sharing is inspired by the one I found, which was featured on Babble. Kathy’s version was raw and mine’s not, so if you’re on a raw diet, by all means, stick with her version. But for those of you not on a raw diet, this is probably about the creamiest, dreamiest chocolate shake you’ll have that just happens to be vegan and totally healthy enough to call breakfast.  Since making this for the first time a week or so back, it’s been my go-to breakfast nearly every morning – so freaking delicious. You can taste the bananas only slightly, so if they’re not your thing, try it anyway.  You can easily add more cocoa powder to make the chocolate flavor even more prominent. Also, if you can’t have or absolutely despise bananas, you could probably just sub all frozen strawberries or blueberries for a similar result. I also highly recommend sneaking in some flaxseed and spinach for added nutrition without any affect on the flavor. Bottoms up!  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/creamy-chocolate-breakfast-shake/
0,Mexican Hot Cocoa and Vegan Whipped Cream | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mexican Hot Chocolate with Coconut Whipped Cream  Having friends over this weekend? Hosting an all-girls affair? Just staying in and playing cozy all by your lonesome self? All three are excellent options if you ask me. But in any case I have just the thing: Vegan Mexican Hot Chocolate with sweet cinnamon, earthy nutmeg, spicy nutmeg cayenne and a dollop of creamy coconut whipped cream. Oh yeah, #youknowyouwantthis.   As you know from my Boozy Pumpkin White Hot Chocolate story, I love hot chocolate. Its hot, sweet and chocolate-y goodness never does me wrong. But since I’m a part-time vegan and lover of all things coconut and spice, I decided to give an alternative recipe a try.   The base of this beverage is simple: Non-dairy milk (I mixed full-fat coconut milk and vanilla almond milk), cocoa powder, vanilla extract, salt, sugar, and pinches of Vietnamese cinnamon, nutmeg, and extra-hot cayenne. Then for a luxurious finish I add a layer of vanilla-infused coconut “whipped cream” made with my remaining coconut milk and drizzle it on top with a little chocolate syrup for good measure. If my hot cocoa-loving neighbors wouldn’t have been nearby for sampling, I would’ve guzzled the whole batch down by myself.

0,Vegan Everything Breakfast Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Everything Breakfast Cookies  As I write this post I’m sitting in bed nibbling on the last of these cookies. I don’t know whether to savor these few remaining bites and relish in how truly delicious they are or weep over their soon-to-be absence. Yes, these cookies are that good; and they’re healthy.  I’ve made banana-based cookies before and this recipe is based off of that concept. Only this time I added a healthy scoop of pumpkin puree to the batter, as I always seem to have an excess of it lying around in the fall. I also made them vegan and nearly gluten free thanks to the help of almond meal in place of most the flour (the whole 2 dozen batch has just 1/2 cup whole wheat flour). They also feature pecans and dried cranberries in addition to dark chocolate chips for extra substance. For this reason, I can easily call them breakfast with a clear conscious. But really, they’re so delicious I can eat them morning noon and night (and I do).  These cookies are irresistibly delicious, and unlike other desserts don’t leave you feeling miserable and heavy afterwards. They are insanely moist and slightly dense, pack a healthy serving of protein thanks to both almond butter and almond meal as well as pecans, and are just sweet enough with the addition of agave nectar and dark chocolate chips. You simply can’t have just one – you have to have two or three. Trust me, I tried. Didn’t work out.  Bake these, snack on these, share these, save these all for yourself. But simply don’t pass up making them – they’re too good to miss out on.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-everything-breakfast-cookies/
0,Baked Sweet Potato Chips | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Baked Sweet Potato Chips  A few weeks ago we had our neighbors up for dinner and they brought the most fabulous sweet potato chips; baked sweet potato chips, I might add. I’d never tasted sweet potato chips so crispy, light and flavorful! Two bites in and I knew I needed the recipe. Thanks Laura, you’re a lifesaver. John finally likes sweet potatoes in some form. This is some kind of pre-Christmas miracle.  Out of curiosity since I don’t have a mandolin, I made these sweet potato chips two ways: I sliced half the batch thinly with a knife (left) and the other half with a vegetable peeler (right). The results were equally delicious, but I must say the knife method yielded a more satisfying bite so I’d recommend this over the peeler.  These chips are awesome! So crispy and flavorful, and all they require is a little olive oil and a pinch of salt before going into the oven to bake for a couple hours. That’s the trick – keeping your oven at 250 degrees and flipping once during the baking process to make sure they crisp up on both sides. The result is amazing. These are a great stand-alone side dish but you could also top them with black beans, salsa and cheese for some crazy delicious nachos. Or you could add them to a sandwich for some serious crunch. Dream big people, the possibilities are endless.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/baked-sweet-potato-chips/
0,Vegan Gingerbread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Gingerbread Waffles  Ho, ho, ho. Happy, November? Wow, how did that happen? 2012 is practically gone. Time to get (holiday) baking. One of the quintessential flavors of the holidays is gingerbread. I’ve made ginger cookies and a small army of gingerbread men before, but never waffles. However, this recipe has been brewing in my mind for a while now and I was so pleased that it only took one try to get it right! I honestly half expected to see a crumbly mess upon opening up the waffle iron since the batter is vegan. But alas, it wasn’t so! Experimentation success.  This batter really is very simple to throw together. You likely already have all the essentials in your pantry right now: Pumpkin puree, molasses, whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar, ground ginger and cinnamon. Basic stuff, plus a little flaxseed and non-dairy milk to help keep this dish vegan. Buckle up kids – we’re quickly entering into vegan holiday foodie heaven.  Have I ever told you that John does all of the pouring for the photos? The pictures really wouldn’t be the same without him. I mean, how awkward would it look if my outstretched forearm was lurking in on the side of all the images, struggling to get that perfect pour down? Awkward, trust me. I’ve tried it and it doesn’t work out. So much praise to the photo assistant, who, in this instance, happens to be my adoring, charming and incredibly well groomed husband.  These waffles turned out as delectable as they look. Tender, spicy, not too sweet and hearty enough to be a stand alone breakfast. Plus, during the cooking process I found a way to help the waffles remain crispy once out of the iron. Simply lay them on a cooling rack so air circulates around them. I’ve noticed that when I stack my waffles on a plate they get steamy and make each other a bit soggy. But when you lay them on the cooling rack for just a minute or two before digging in, it’s perfect! You could also make them even crispier by warming them in the toaster for a bit after cooling.

0,Vegan Beer Chili | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Beer Chili  I don’t know if you’ve ever cooked with beer, but if you haven’t you probably should. I am not a beer drinker myself in the slightest – an occasional hard cider at best – but I love what beer does to dishes. Somehow, it brings a new depth of rustic flavor to recipes that I absolutely adore. Though it was the last thing I expected, I am very much in love with this chili.   Of course, you can add meat to this dish if you’d like. I’ve tried it both ways and like them about the same. To do so, simply add a half pound of ground beef or turkey in place of the black (or kidney) beans for an equally delectable result.   When I make this chili I love having it for two meals in one week for the sake of convenience and cost. One night, we’ll have it as is with a side of cornbread, and another we’ll have it atop baked sweet or regular potatoes. I can’t decide which way I like it better – I’ll have to get back to you on that.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-beer-chili/
0,Nut and Honey Coconut Granola Recipe | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Nut-and-Honey Coconut Granola  A few years ago I was home sick from work with the flu. In my misery, I experienced a brief moment of hope where I emerged from a mountain of covers and kleenex to attempt to boost my spirits in the kitchen. I knew the one thing that would make me feel better was granola. I’ve always loved its heartiness and vibrant, sweet scent when it’s baking. I love that it has 16 times more protein than box cereal so you can enjoy a bit less and feel satisfied a bit more. And I love that it lends itself perfectly to yogurt parfaits. So I mustered the energy to scuttle downstairs to our 1950s-style kitchen on the sunny, chilly winter day that it was and baked up a batch. This is a variation of that original recipe, which I still make today. Bundled in my blankets fashioned as an oversized dress and my furry slippers that many concerned friends have since convinced me to throw away, I stood there in the kitchen with sunlight streaming through the windows and sweet granola scent filling the air. Still groggy from my meds, I managed to have the thought, “Wouldn’t it be nice if I could just stay home and bake granola for people all day?” While that dream hasn’t been completely fulfilled, I am getting closer with my role on Minimalist Baker. So thanks for tagging along and following what we do. You guys are pretty stinking awesome.  I love that I get to play with ingredients in recipes like this one. It’s like I get to be a mad scientist in a sense, but with a pyrex and spatula instead of flask and tongs. To this batch I added pecans, cocoa powder and subbed coconut oil for canola. I was super pleased with the result as it came out smelling like coconut heaven, was just sweet enough, and basically consisted of half nuts half oats – yum.  By the time you read this post this granola is likely gone (#momentofsilence). But it was excellent while it lasted, and you can trust that I’ll be back in the kitchen dreaming up another batch soon – sick day or not.

I hated coffee. Then I spilled it on myself. True story.   Since then hot chocolate and I have made amends. The stain came out. I once again remembered the luscious hot chocolate of my youth, even if it did consist of Ovaltine and freeze-dried marshmallows. It warms me when I’m bitterly cold in the wintertime. You could say we’re hot for each other again. Also a true story.  Sure, classic hot chocolate is good and well. But this hot chocolate is WHITE hot (get it?) and filled with pumpkin puree and plenty of pumpkin pie spice. And booze! Did I mention the booze?! It has booze.   The best part about this drink besides the fact that it’s perfect for cold-weather gatherings, grown up enough for even the manliest of manly men, and quintessentially fall, is that it warrants being topped with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Ooohhh yeahh.  If you love the buttery sweet flavor of white chocolate, the spicy heartiness of pumpkin, and the luscious decadence that is whipped cream and caramel (and booze – two kinds, pick your poison), then this is thee fall drink for you.

0,Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries and Almonds | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Creamy Pumpkin Oats with Blueberries and Toasted Almonds  Yes, it is only the fourth week in October and I’m already slightly tiring of pumpkin. What am I going to do come Thanksgiving when my aunt makes me an entire pumpkin cream pie? I better start pacing myself.  In reality I love pumpkin, just not always in traditional settings like muffins, lattes and pies. I like to venture out and enjoy it instead in its most pure forms, like stirred into an old fashioned oats with just a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon. The flavor speaks subtly of fall, just the way I prefer it.  Recently I’ve been making creamy pumpkin oats with almond milk (a tip I was reminded of by Aubrey) and nestling them over a layer of blueberries. On top, I simply can’t get enough of crushed, toasted almonds. The creamy-crunchy contrast in texture it provides is nothing short of soul warming.  I’ve made this dish about a half-dozen times now and I think it gets better with each attempt. Try this for breakfast, won’t you? It’s a vegan-friendly breakfast packed with vitamins and nutrients and plenty of fall flavor. Is there really a better way to get your day started off right than that? I strongly doubt it.

0,Vegan Banana Nut Muffins for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Banana Nut Muffins for 2  I’ve decided there are a lot of things that have to go right in my day to make it a good one. Quality coffee, good hair, new wears, exceptional weather, and of course, delicious food. If any one of these factors are amiss, there’s a fair chance the day’s events will follow suit. However, one particular trip to Kansas City with John proved to be quite the opposite. It was, for a lack of a better adjective, awesome.  It started with a good 30 minutes of playtime with the nephew at my sister and brother-in-law’s place in KC. There were lots of plastic bats and softballs flying, and fits of toddler squeals every few seconds. It was sheer joy. Then, off to the ladies room I went and a few shots of dry shampoo and a swipe of makeup later, John and I were out the door. Our first stop was the Plaza where we had one thing on our minds: coffee.  After walking into Latte Land and having a quick scan of the menu, my eyes were immediately drawn to the most beautiful banana muffin I’d ever seen, studded with giant whole, shelled walnuts. My mind was made up: A medium house coffee and that giant banana muffin.  A few minutes went by after receiving my coffee and I realized they’d forgotten my muffin. Extremely apologetic, the barista snagged my prize from the pastry case and offered me some free milk as a remedy for his fault. I obliged. The setting was perfect: Coffee, a banana muffin the size of my fist, and free local milk and wifi – I was in sheer heaven.  One bite into that muffin and I already wanted another one. Instead, I settled for recreating the recipe at home. Just a few days later upon our return back to Wichita, that’s exactly what I did. And literally, this is one of the best muffins I’ve ever had.  Three things I love about this recipe are 1) it’s hearty and healthy, 2) takes less than an hour to prepare, and 3) yields two GIANT vegan muffins that are seriously worthy of being sold at that very coffee shop. I wonder if they have an opening for a part-time baker? If so, that would be awesome, because I’m convinced the world needs more of these muffins.  These muffins are insanely moist and perfectly sweet, and they scream with rich banana flavor. And those giant nuts up top? Everything I’d hoped for and more. Plus, thanks to wholesome ingredients like flaxseed, whole-wheat pastry flour, and whole, shelled almonds, they’re actually quite healthy. At about 370 calories a piece, one of these constitutes a full breakfast meal. Since that’s about what I eat in the morning anyway, I’d be happy to keep these as a special weekend treat or cycle them the into my weekday breakfast routine. Oh joy.

0,Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Cookies & Glaze | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Cookies  Cinnamon rolls and I kinda have a thing. You see, we’ve practically been lovers since the 3rd grade when I discovered they were the one thing the lunch ladies at my school made from scratch that actually tasted like food. Chili and cinnamon roll days were a special occasion and only came around once every few weeks in the winter months. This meant every fourth Friday people went into an all-out flurry rushing to the cafeteria to claim their sticky prize. Little did they know I’d sidled them and was always first in line, wide-eyed gripping my tray with a silly grin on my face, waving my finger at the biggest cinnamon roll in the bunch chirping “Ooh ooh, mine mine,” at the lunch ladies. They surely hated my 10-year-old self, tragically crooked teeth and all. What ensued next was practically material for “50 Shades of Grey.” As I sat perched on the brown plastic benches in our cafeteria I stole delicate bites of my cinnamon roll between sinfully large spoonfuls of chili and anticipated that last ooey-gooey center bite – a climax and tragic ending all in one. Once the experience drew to a close it was cold lunch city provided by mom until the next chili and cinnamon roll day came around.    I’ve tried to make cinnamon rolls from scratch before, but without my mom by my side gently instructing me at every tur they always turn out like hockey pucks – nowhere near worthy of being enveloped in creamy frosting and consumed while cuddled up in a cozy chair with a hot cup of tea. Not even close.  So my solution in the meantime? Cinnamon roll cookies. PUMPKIN cinnamon roll cookies. You know, because it’s fall and whatnot.   This caramel glaze is my mom’s super secret recipe that she would share with anyone who asks. I called her the night before I baked my cookies to copy down the instructions and once more when I was in the process of making it. I wanted to make sure it was just right; can’t bring cinnamon roll disgrace to the family name, after all.  Hmm, based on the texture, caramel flavor and how it practically slid off my whisk onto my cookies, I’d say I nailed it.   Wondering what they taste like? Imagine a delicate sugar cookie with a gooey pumpkin butter-brown sugar center and a melt-in-your mouth caramel glaze. One cookie in and you’ll already be dreaming about your next two. These aren’t your delicate tea time, laugh with your mouth closed and legs crossed type of cookie. They’re more of a full fat chocolate milk from the can “eat like a trucker while grunting ‘yeeeee haw'” type of cookie. Get the picture? Yeah…good.

After all, there’s a lot of dessert out there in the world and I want to ensure that he only oogles at my goodies, if you catch my drift   I’ve wanted to infuse the flavor of chai into cookies for a while now and thought this the perfect time since the weather is cooling down, the leaves are starting to turn, and I’ve officially started craving hot tea every single day. And so, a chai infusion it was.  To mock the flavor of chai in these bars, I simply added all of the spices you’d find in traditional chai tea: cinnamon, clove, cardamom and ginger – some of the loveliest spices around if you ask me. And the result was a hearty dessert bar with all of the flavor and texture of a traditional oatmeal raisin cookie but with a punch of chai spice in each bite. Oh man, these are a total win.

0,Vegan Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Cornbread Waffles  When it comes to breakfast, I can hardly decide between which one of my favorites to indulge in on any given day. Oatmeal, pancakes, steel cut oats, french toast – there’s simply too many delicious options to choose from. But if I had to pick just one, besides my true love of pancakes, it’d have to be waffles.  These waffles scream fall in every way: Cornbread, pumpkin, maple syrup, cinnamon – a little taste of autumn in each bite. Plus, both the ingredients list and time required to prepare them remain minimal – just the way I like it.  Oh, and did I mention they’re vegan? I almost left that out. Pumpkin vegan waffles for the win.  What I loved most about these waffles – besides the fact that they were moist and tasted exactly how I’d hoped – is that they have a nice crisp that waffles can sometimes lack. Couple the ideal texture with the rich pumpkin-cornbread flavor and we have near breakfast perfection on our hands.  I topped mine with a little Earth Balance and maple syrup and was smiling bigger with each bite. Just too good to put into words.  If you’re looking for a healthy fall breakfast recipe, give this one a try. You likely already have all of the ingredients on hand, and who can resist a waffle, really?

0,Vegan Pumpkin Apple Muffins | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Pumpkin Apple Muffins  When John and I started dating, one of my favorite things about him, besides his ridiculously good taste in music and his honey-brown eyes, was the fact that he could bake muffins. And I’m not talking about a sissy muffin. I’m talking about a whole wheat, fruit packed, tank of a muffin. Now that’s my kind of man.   He either knew how to make muffins or researched it and figured it out to impress me. Either way, I think he’s worthy of being a keeper.  These muffins are surprisingly simple to throw together, ridiculously moist, full of fall flavor and 100% vegan.  Sautéed apples and plenty of pumpkin puree are the star ingredients in this recipe, with oats and brown sugar playing key supporting roles.  If I had to pick one food to subsist off of (besides bananas, Braum’s coffee ice cream and peanut butter) it would be oats. It’s nature’s perfect food, I’m convinced. Plus, they look so prit-dee on top of overflowing muffins.  This was an experimental recipe but one bite in I knew I’d found a winner. Crazy moist, hints of pumpkin, and little gems of cinnamon-sugar coated apples throughout.  These muffins are healthy, perfect for snacking or for breakfast, delightfully portable, and exactly what you need in your kitchen this fall. Agreed? Agreed.

0,Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Dutch Baby for 2 | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Dutch Baby  Hey, hey, hey, it’s a dutch baby! Who doesn’t like a dutch baby? Come on…  I attempted my very first dutch baby earlier this year and have been on a dutch roll ever since. First, I dabbled in traditional varieties like blueberry lemon. But now that it’s fall, I can’t get pumpkin flavors off my mind.  This could easily be topped with powdered sugar for a more traditional serving style. But I opted for semisweet chocolate chips and let’s just say that wasn’t a bad decision.  This dutch baby turned out moist, light and rich with pumpkin flavor. A sprinkle of cinnamon and melted chocolate chips made the perfect “frosting,” for this simple breakfast dish for two.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-dutch-baby/
0,Pumpkin French Toast Bake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin French Toast Bake  Pumpkin french toast = breakfast of champions. Take my word.  Remember my 7-ingredient muesli bread? Well, it’s making another appearance in this pumpkin french toast. Chopped up into cubes, it makes the perfect base for a very fall breakfast.  I’ve always made french toast the traditional route: dip bread into egg batter and fry right when you’re ready to eat. But, making it the day before and baking in the morning is actually a lot easier. Plus, it doesn’t require a griddle and allows the bread plenty of time to soak up the pumpkin-y goodness.  The ‘batter’ consisted of several free range eggs, a healthy dash of milk, a scoop of pumpkin butter and plenty of pumpkin pie spice. Topped with brown sugar and it was good to go.  You guys, it’s possible that I’ve never been so excited to hop up out of bed on a Saturday to preheat my oven. The anticipation nearly stole precious hours of sleep, but it was so, so worth it.  As you can see, it turned out phenomenal. The crusty, raisin-dotted bread soaked up the batter and yielded a custard-like french toast bake that smelled like heaven in the oven.  Topped with a little maple syrup (agave or honey) and it’s phenomenal. Not to mention it could feed your entire family and most of your neighbors. I ended up driving mine around to several friends and sharing a healthy portion. Now they think I’m the “french toast fairy” – not sure that’s a reputation I’m willing – or able – to keep up. Either way, it was fun while it lasted.  If there’s just two of you dining on this breakfast, simply cut the recipe in half or even one-fourth for a more appropriate serving size. Either way, this recipe should be on your fall bucket list. I’m so glad I’ve already crossed it off of mine.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/pumpkin-french-toast-bake/
0,Pumpkin Bark | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Pumpkin Bark  You guys, I simply couldn’t resist.  With fall officially upon us, there’s simply not much I can do in the way of restraining my pumpkin fever. And this recipe is one of my favorite creations thus far.  It’s a two-layer bark: dark chocolate on bottom and white chocolate infused with pumpkin pie spice on top. The sprinkles? Almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. How very delectable and healthy. The flavor combination is exquisite. Plenty of decadence from the dark chocolate, a sweet yet spicy addition from the pumpkin-infused white chocolate, and lots of irresistible crunch from the fruit and nuts.  I took this batch into friends at work and several have already pestered me for the recipe. One even said she’d pay for it! Well well, adoring public, here it is. Pumpkin bark, and it doesn’t get much easier or more delicious.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/pumpkin-bark/
0,5-Ingredient Pumpkin Frappuccino | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"5-Ingredient Pumpkin Frappuccino  I like the way my boss puts it: Fall rolls around and the pumpkin spice latte comes back and “everyone loses their damn mind.” Yep, that’s the caffeine crowd I’m catering to today – myself included.  Remember when I made my 3 ingredient mocha frappe a while back? It was such a hit among readers that I decided to recreate it, but this time more fall friendly. I added some pumpkin butter to my milk “ice cubes” using this recipe, which I loosely followed. But if you don’t have pumpkin butter, you can just use pumpkin puree and add a bit more pumpkin pie spice and sweetener, or sub a pumpkin-flavored syrup.  I opted for cold brew coffee that I brewed the night before and strained in the morning, but any chilled espresso or bold roast coffee will do.  Once you add your pumpkin ice cubes to the blender, all you need to add is coffee. Anything else is completely optional: creamer, additional sweetener or spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.). The result is a creamy, pumpkin frappuccino with plenty of sweet and spice. I opt to call it a pumpkin-cinno. Festive, eh? I believe this would make the perfect beverage for your morning work commute – it certainly does mine.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-pumpkin-frappuccino/
0,Vegan Snickers Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Snickers Pancakes  When I was a little girl, I used to love going shopping with my mom. We’d play music in the car, both get a little something for ourselves, and there was almost always some kind of dessert involved. If it was Dairy Queen, Mom would get a chocolate dip cone every time; I’d opt for the grape star kiss (total fail now that I think about it). If it was Braum’s, dirt sundae for me every time. But if it was the grocery store, there was no question about it: I was getting a Snickers.  Snickers have always been my favorite candy bar for four reasons: nougat, peanut, chocolate, caramel; enough said.  These pancakes mock those flavors precisely, but in a healthier, more vegan sort of way.  Think warm, pillowy vegan pancakes studded with salty peanuts and plenty of chocolate chips.  Then topped off with vegan caramel and served warm and melty for morning delight.  Though I’d been dreaming up ways to approach this recipe for what seems like months, I finally came to the conclusion that it doesn’t have to be that complicated: Simply draw in the flavors most prevalent in Snickers in a creative way while keeping it as healthy and delicious as possible.  I don’t wanna brag or anything but…NAILED IT.   These cakes turned out lovely. Fluffy vanilla pancakes with a sprinkle of oats and a touch of whole grain, lots of salty peanuts paired with bittersweet chocolate, and a hit-you-in-your-mouth syrup in the form of homemade vegan caramel sauce. This is a breakfast I won’t be forgetting anytime soon.    ",https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-snickers-pancakes/
0,Peach Vegan Cupcakes + Buttercream Frosting | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Vegan Peach Cupcakes with Honey Buttercream Frosting  A few weeks back we had a wedding shower to attend. Two of our very best friends are tying le knot in early October. John’s the best man; I’m the unofficial caterer to the bride. The couple has promised, nay, demanded we dance at the reception. They’re serving our home-roasted coffee. It shall be a blast.   For the shower, I wanted to bring treats – it’s simply my nature. My mom used to bring cupcakes in a cone to my school class for my birthday. You’d think that alone would’ve made me the coolest kid in school, but when you factor in my mushroom cut, painfully shy demeanor and 6 crooked teeth all fighting for front row spots, that couldn’t be any further from the truth. That’s OK, things took an upswing in middle school. Who needs third grade popularity anyway?  These cupcakes feature two whole peaches, plenty of vegan baked goodness, cake cones and honey buttercream. Quite the rag-tag team if you ask me.  Peaches and honey are simply meant to be together, like peanut butter and basil, wine and sitcoms, and Saturdays and sleeping in. You can imagine a cupcake + buttercream marriage is even more dreamy than the pair in its natural state. Trust, I know my sugary treats.  My cupcakes had a superb showing at the shower. Three down in the first 10 minutes and the rest not long after. I heard lots of moaning, plenty of “what is this?!” and several “ugh, sooo gooooods.” You know that’s a good sign. While I can’t guarantee these will make you popular among your former third grade peers, they will make you some new friends now, even if they’re just using you for your sweet, delectable honey buttercream frosting.

0,7-Ingredient Muesli Bread | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"7-Ingredient Muesli Bread  When I think of homemade bread, I think of lazy Sunday mornings spent covered in flour with messy hair and no intention of showering. When the bread comes out of the oven, I slice that perfect piece out of the middle and slather it with butter and jam. Accompanied by an egg and a cup of good coffee, a simple weekend meal doesn’t get much better.   When John and I were living in Portland, we discovered the absolute best coffee shop in town. Yes, there are plenty: West coasters take their coffee seriously. But we found the absolute best. Its name is Heart. Nestled in a little strip on Burnside sits the quaint little black and white shop with huge window fronts, a giant exposed roaster in the center of the store, newspapers strewn about in messy stacks, a staff of blasé hipsters, and the best lattes in the world. What does this have to do with bread? A lot, in fact.  Heart Coffee is all about supporting local, as are most Portland businesses, which is why they carried the only the freshest local baked goods from around the area. Homemade whoopie pies, cinnamon rolls, giant wrapped muffins with berries plump and gushing out the side, and – our favorite – muesli toast.  Muesli simply means mixed granola – fruit, nuts, seeds, oats; whatever suits your fancy. But what few people experience is muesli in toast, which creates a euphoric combination of flavors and a sensational crunch that makes you resent regular toasts forevermore. Slather your slice with butter and honey and you have a near-perfect breakfast in tow.  Every Sunday morning before church, John and I would invite friends to meet us at Heart for coffee and a chat. Sometimes no one was quite awake. Sometimes it was too loud to hear yourself talk. Sometimes no one showed up but us. But there was always, always a fresh loaf of muesli bread waiting to be thick sliced, toasted, and served alongside soft butter and local honey. Pair that with a perfectly-crafted latte and Sunday mornings were never so awesome as this.  This loaf is a rustic style, but you could easily split into two small loaf pans to pull off a more formal shape. I, however, prefer the former.  The little raisins puffed out the side, which reminded me why it’s smart to keep them toward the center of the loaf. Else they get crisp and require dusting off before eating. Consider yourself tipped off to this little trick. Your thanks, my welcome.  I was so pleased with the way this batch turned out. Crusty on the outside, warm and soft on the inside with plenty of crunchy, sweet notes from the fruit and nuts. I lathered mine with a little butter and honey and it was a dream. But once it sets for a few days, it makes the perfect base for a french toast bake (recipe to come soon).   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-muesli-bread/
0,Cucumber Cooler Cocktails | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Cucumber Cooler Cocktails  It might seem like we’re quite the lush pair here at Minimalist Baker, but that really isn’t the case. We simply enjoy a quality cocktail every now and again, especially when it’s light, delicious and easy to make. This cucumber cooler is no exception.   When my boss was in town a few weeks ago, we all went out for drinks. It was the perfect evening really. Late summer, still warm enough to forgo a jacket, the service was spot-on, the live music was the best I’ve ever heard in Wichita, and the cocktails? Rather a dream.  John ordered a drink featuring cucumber slices and after one sip, I was quickly regretting my pinot noir. In fact, every time he turned to talk to my boss, I’d sneak sips. Rather sneaky, I am.  This recipe is as simple as it gets: gin, lime, mint, cucumber and tonic water. Even the novice bartender can throw this together at the amazement of onlooking guests. Plus, it’s easy to modify to suit each person’s taste, allowing you to please even the pickiest of palettes. For example, John prefers sour, I prefer sweet – bring on the sugar.  In just a few minutes we had a lovely cocktail on our hands. And it seemed the longer we sipped on it the better it became as the flavors were given more time to marry.     What does it taste like? A sophisticated limeade. An upgraded mojito. Cucumber water on steroids. Just try it, you will love.   ",https://minimalistbaker.com/cucumber-cooler-cocktails/
0,Strawberry Cake Magic Shell | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Cake Magic Shell  Once upon a time a little girl was born and she grew up to love ice cream, very very much.  So much so, in fact, that it became a staple in her diet, even through her years at university.  But one too many trips to a certain soft serve machine in the cafeteria left her feeling worse for the wear and regretting her sweet tooth quite dreadfully.  So she tried as she might to give up sweets. But after months of saying ‘no’ to her favorite frozen dessert in an attempt to practice restraint, she finally gave in and the two were reunited once again. (cue: *embrace*)  “I knew you always loved me,” the ice cream said. “I’ll never quit you again, I promise,” the girl exclaimed.  From that day forward there wasn’t a week that went by that the girl didn’t have an ice cream cone at least once.  And the two lived happily ever – with sprinkles. The end.

0,White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pancakes  The reason I made these pancakes is simple: I love white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. I worked at a sandwich shop as a college student and I always volunteered to bake the cookies for the day. Know why? Playing with cookie dough (&lt;–awesome) lends itself to white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts falling to the bottom of the box as “waste” (&lt;–double awesome). Guess what? I had to clump them together with some cookie dough and eat it as a snack (&lt;–unspeakably awesome).   Whoever discovered this flavor combination deserves a treat. Like a pancake. Hey, I have that!  In all seriousness, this pancake recipe is ridiculously simple. And if you love white chocolate macadamia nut cookies you simply must make them. Cookies for breakfast? I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. You seem to be in full support.  These pancakes are not only simple but also vegan, assuming you can get your hands on some non-dairy white chocolate chips, which shouldn’t be too hard in this day and age.  As always, this pancake recipe is free of butter and eggs and very limited in added sugar and oil. While these cakes don’t have the crisp, crumbly texture of their cookie twins, the melty chocolate chips and fluffy, nutty layers more than make up for it.  Top your stack with a few melty white chocolate chips and a little agave nectar or maple syrup for good measure and you’ll be in pancake pleasure town in no time. Trust me, I went there and it’s awesome.         ",https://minimalistbaker.com/white-chocolate-macadamia-nut-pancakes/
0,Mint Citrus White Wine Sangria | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Mint and Citrus White Wine Sangria  I wasn’t always a wine drinker. In fact, it took a little convincing by my husband before I ventured past the one, safe merlot I was clinging to. Stupid me. I should’ve opened up the floodgates to wine years ago. Well, now I sound like a lush – at least we got that out of the way.  The summer we lived in Portland our friends invited us to their wedding followed by one of the most perfect receptions I’ve ever attended. There was a tent. There were close friends. There was an angry mob across the street protesting foie gras. There was dancing to bluegrass music even though no one knew what the hell they were doing. There was lemon blueberry and chocolate ganache cake, which I embraced two slices of. And, there was sangria.  Sangria is delicate, refreshing, and sweet. It’s the perfect afternoon drink and especially lovely for a wine novice that’s not quite used to the dry taste it can sometimes leave behind. It is colorful, it is beautiful, it is a party in a glass. In other words, it is the unofficial queen of the wine scene.  This particular recipe was inspired by my love for all things citrus and, of course, mint. I could eat mint and basil by the handful, hence the reason they pop up on Minimalist Baker so often. To prepare this sangria, you’ll need a dry white wine, lime, lemon, simple syrup, and mint. We opted for a pinot grigio, deciding a chardonnay wouldn’t complement the citrus as well.  The result is a refreshing white sangria with plenty of lemon-lime flavor and the slightest hint of mint. But if you love mint as much as we do, feel free to add more. We won’t judge.

Both of these items are very important.  When I tell you these bars taste just like a no bake cookie, I’m not playing around. I REPEAT: This is not a joke.  No bake cookies are the bomb. For the record, they nor the word “bomb” will ever go out of style. My mother can attest that no bakes are my kryptonite. I’m rendered defenseless in their presence. I once jumped up and down like a little girl when someone brought a plate to class…IN HIGH SCHOOL. I repeat: NOT JOKING AROUND.  When I recently discovered the wonder that is medjool dates, I almost cried. Adding them to any recipe makes it sweet as pie and replaces any need for added sugar. So picture this: dates, peanut butter, dark chocolate chips, oats, a.k.a no-bake cookie in the mouth. Oh yes, we’re going there.  These bars are nutritious and super simple, yet taste just like one of my favorite desserts. And with just four ingredients, you really can’t go wrong.

0,Ginger and Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Candied Ginger &amp; Sea Salt Chocolate Chip Cookies  I have this little crush on cookies. Not the coy kind of crush that lends itself to sweet little nibbles and quiet, playful stares. No, the kind that leads you into in a closet by yourself where you compulsively eat 15 cookies before coming to the realization of what just happened. Yeah, that kind of crush; the 7-minutes in heaven type.  I also have a wee little crush on Joy the Baker. So when she posted a recipe recently for ginger walnut chocolate blondies, I started drooling all over the keyboard and simultaneously kneeling down of my computer with arms raised chanting, “All hail Joy! All hail Joy!” Or something like that. And then I promptly scuttled off to the kitchen to figure out how to candy ginger and then pump it into cookies – bite-sized pillowy little clouds of butter-infused goodness. Come to mama.  It turns out candying ginger isn’t that difficult. DON’T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS. All you need is some fresh ginger, sugar, water and patience. Chop, boil, simmer, dry, and coat in sugar – it’s as simple as that. Then throw the little gems into cookie batter and wait anxiously as they cook to perfection in the oven. See that bite right there? Down there? It took all the self control in my cookie-loving body not to inhale that entire thing along with the other half dozen on the rack. I mean, candied ginger and sea salt chocolate chip cookies? COME ON.  If you’re a fan of ginger, you must make these cookies. If you’re not a fan of ginger, you must make these cookies.

But after learning that they had enough calories to sink a boat I strayed back to my americano. Whew, muffin top averted.  If you’ve never had cold brew coffee you should. The way I make it you grind bold coffee, put it in a large bowl with water, then slide it in the fridge overnight. The next morning you have fresh coffee awaiting you beside your gallon of milk and half-used carton of eggs. Easy – it’s like stowing away a personal barista in your kitchen without the temptation of an 1,800 calorie muffin on the side. Oh delight!  So in the morning, you strain your coffee. I did ours in our Chemex, which is bomb. But can also do it over cheesecloth and a strainer, or in a french press.

In other words, childhood, reclaimed!  They’re insanely delicious pillowy clouds of cinnamon-y, maple goodness and I could not wait to share them with you.  The initial idea was to make a french toast cookie, and I think I achieved that. Cinnamon cookie + maple buttercream frosting = edible gold. But I also think I figured out a much less tedious way to make homemade Pop Tarts. Exciting, right?! I mean…come on.   I took these to a summer BBQ at work and the entire pan was annihilated within the hour. All that was missing from the experience for me was that I wasn’t sitting at home by myself, watching a Netflix movie in my fat pants dunking my cookies into a giant glass of whole milk. Now that would’ve been a complete cookie-eating experience, no doubt.  I highly recommend them as an afternoon treat or a late-night indulgence. Dunk them in milk, have them with coffee, sandwich two together, wrap them in foil and give them to a friend.

All hail the frozen cocktail!  To make this delicious beverage you need just 5 ingredients: Watermelon, limes, sugar, white rum, and club soda. That’s it!  Simply muddle a lime with rum and sugar, add watermelon ice cubes and juice, and top it off with club soda. You’ll be in grown-up limeade heaven in no time.  The best part about this cocktail – besides the fact that it takes no time to throw together – is that the watermelon ice cubes get all melty and boozy and make the perfect treat to munch on as you sip the drink down. Sure, you may look like a fool maneuvering a straw to slide watermelon cubes up the side of your glass directly into your mouth, but it’s totally worth any embarrassment you may experience.  We enjoyed these drinks alongside tacos one night, and the combination was just outstanding. When our glasses were empty, we were quickly left wanting more.

Just like life sometimes calls for a naked Saturday or an evening of doing nothing but eating ice cream and watching touching documentaries on Netflix that make you cry over people’s personal triumphs. Because sometimes, all that will scratch that itch in life is a little self-indulgence.   While I would put these waffles in the “indulge” category, they’re definitely a healthy indulgence. With no added sugar besides the chocolate chips, plenty of fiber from old fashioned oats, and tons of banana flavor from two whole bananas, I don’t feel one ounce of guilt for having these as a weekday treat or a slow weekend breakfast; and you shouldn’t either.  I named these banana bread waffles for a reason: They are a quicker way to make banana bread that mocks the flavor to a ‘T.’ Plus, anytime there’s chocolate chips in the mix, I say it’s a party. So consider this a (healthy) breakfast party, in the mouth.  They’re easy to make, requiring just 1 bowl, 30 minutes, and simple ingredients. Plus, they’re gluten-free friendly andnaturally sweet (minus the chocolate chips)!  We hope you LOVE these waffles!

0,Strawberry Danish French Toast | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Strawberry Danish French Toast  Going into donut shops was one of my greatest joys in life as a kid. I knew exactly what I wanted every time: maple long john with chocolate milk with a back-up plan of anything chocolate glazed or pink and covered in sprinkles. Gold, every time.  But these days, my palette is much more refined. I go for the frosting-free kinds, the ones without holes, and certainly avoid anything with the terms ‘long’ and ‘john’ in it. They’re just plain childish. Nah, just kidding. My donut preferences haven’t changed at all since I was a kid. In fact, they’ve probably gotten worse. But every now and then it’s good to branch out and ‘upgrade’ as we age. And if that means adding a strawberry danish to the rotation every once in a while, I’m OK with that. Not all changes are bad, after all. Although bangs, bangs are usually a bad idea – especially for us greasy forehead types. Too, much, oil.  But enough about donuts and who shouldn’t wear bangs and onto the finer things in life, like french toast. When it comes to this breakfast classic, I’m usually the ‘give-it-to-me’ straight type: plain with a little butter and a drizzle of syrup. But these days, I’m upgrading to classier flavors, i.e. strawberry danish. Once I discovered the flavor pairing of goat cheese and strawberry, the idea was to apply it to as many foods as I could think of. And the first one that happened to cross my mind was french toast. And the result? French toast that tastes just like a strawberry, cream cheese danish. Now that’s the type of breakfast I’m willing to branch out for.

0,Healthy Alfredo + Cheesy Garlic Ciabatta | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Light Alfredo Sauce &amp; Cheesy Garlic Ciabatta  While some long to slide out of their shoes and too-tight work pants when they get home from a day at the office, I long to get in the kitchen. Busy evenings are my muse, along with pancakes, ice cream, and freshly-washed strawberries. Other topics for other days, I suppose.  So upon returning from a particularly busy day at the office, I checked the “dinner menu” hanging on the fridge as it were, and saw I’d written “shrimp pasta” on Tuesday. And who am I to go back on my word? Pasta it was.  Confession: I’ve used jarred sauces on my pasta before. Cue: shrill cries, eye rolls and stone throwing. Yada yada yada. But you have to admit, on occasion convenience wins over quality, just like every morning in high school when a pack of chocolate donut gems won over eggs and toast. Time, is, money. Until I perfected this recipe, I went the convenience route when it came to my pasta. But once you’ve tasted homemade, you’ll never go back. In addition to this version taking only 15 minutes or less to throw together, it also requires no butter, no cream and packs a ton of delicious and zesty flavor from parmesan cheese, garlic, pesto and a pinch of red pepper flake.

0,Vegan Coffee Donuts (No Pan!) | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Espresso Glazed Vegan Donuts (No Pan Required)  Being a baker is serious work. The precise measurements, complex ingredients and stacks of complicated equipment can make the task seem too much worth the effort at times. But if you’re like me, that’s half the fun. And tasting the final product makes it all worth it. And, if you’re like me, you also don’t bother with all the extras, i.e. piping bags, frosting tips, Kitchenaid mixers, quesadilla makers, panini presses, emulsifiers, popover molds, culinary torches, etc., etc. You stick to the basics and make it work, just like any real ‘Merican baker would. Plus, who has space for all that junk anyways? Not I. Not little ‘ol minimalist I.   Something I’ve strongly considered buying multiple times in the past is a donut pan. Everyone has one, they’re all the rage, they make beautiful donuts, and they allow you to skip the frying process and opt for baking instead, which is obviously way healthier than drowned in oil. But you know what? I really hate buying things, especially unnecessary things like pans that can only do one thing and take up a crapload of space. Just this week I had cooking spray on my grocery list but passed it up because it was $3 instead of the normal $1.50. Yeah, nevermind – didn’t need it that bad. So you can imagine I ruled out a donut pan for the same reasons.  But then there’s the fact that I’m a donut lover, so what do I do with that? (maple long johns anyone?) I’ll tell you what you do with that. When you love something you find a way to get it, see it, make it, find it, do it. So that’s just what I did. I crafted a recipe that a) didn’t require a donut pan, b) maintained its vegan composure, and c) tasted lip-smacking delicious. And? It’twas a success.

0,Chocolate Cashew Larabar Cookie Pops | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Cashew Cookie Larabar Pops  One of my favorite things about this blog is that I get to share my favorite flavor pairings with you. Peanut butter basil, banana chocolate chip, sweet peanut sauce and spicy sriracha, and now: cranberry, cashew and chocolate.   I discovered the beauty of cranberries cashews and chocolate on a random lunchbreak at work recently. I’d gone out to a shaded bench with a few people in my co-working space, and as ‘dessert’ to my hummus and veggies, I packed a handful of raw cashews, dark chocolate chips and dried cranberries. The result? A flavor combination I wasn’t quite prepared for. Simple yet insanely delicious, so much so that I felt compelled to stop mid-bite, examine my tiny handful, and announce to my friends that they needed to try it immediately. Out of that moment, this little recipe was born. Another food love of mine is Larabars. I still remember when my sister discovered them and quickly turned me on to the apple pie flavor. The experience was just short of life changing. Ever since then recipes have been popping up on how to recreate them at home. So when I discovered my most recent flavor pairing, I knew I had to combine the two loves to make one beautiful recipe. And that, I did.

0,Vegan Oreo Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Oreo Cookie Pancakes  You guys, I can’t even begin to tell you how excited I am about this recipe. Ever since the wild success of my Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Pancakes (which are a must-try, by the way) my brain’s been spinning non-stop coming up with new and exciting breakfast recipes. And this one? This is one I simply couldn’t wait to share. And would you believe it’s healthy and simple to make?   Everyone likes Oreos right? And if you don’t, I mean come on, seriously? These pancakes emulate this childhood favorite perfectly, but are completely vegan, easy to prepare and 100 percent delicious. The creamy vanilla ‘frosting’ is a simple base of coconut butter with a few added ingredients, and the chocolate pancakes feature dark chocolate cocoa powder for a decadent touch without tons of calories.  From start to finish, these cakes take about 15 minutes, which means they can easily be made on hurried weekday mornings – a theory I successfully tested out this week before work. Alternatively, they’d make a blissful weekend treat that would take your lazy Sundays to a whole new level of awesome. Like, seriously.  For pretty photos purposes, I stuffed these guys full of creamy filling. But to keep these within a reasonable calorie limit, I’d suggest spreading it a little thinner. Post photo shoot, I removed quite a bit (with some heavy finger licking) and they were still incredibly delicious without the extra fluff.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/oreo-cookie-pancakes/
0,Peanut Butter and Basil Milkshake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter and Basil Milkshake  Before you shudder, turn away and never return to this blog, know that this recipe is totally worthy of your attention. I told you before that I wasn’t done with the peanut butter and basil combination and for good reason. The two were meant to be together, perhaps more than PB &amp; J. They’re a mind-blowingly delicious combination. Throw ice cream in the mix and you have a cocktail for perfection. This is no lie.   If you thought my PB &amp; Basil Sandwich was a little out there, this may be your sweet gateway drug into peanut butter basil neverland. The flavors meld together so perfectly in this shake that your guests will be left wondering what’s inside. But it’ll be so delicious they won’t care. It can be out little secret. Our delicious little secret.  I made this recipe using regular vanilla ice cream but it could also be made vegan friendly with soy, almond or coconut-based vanilla ice cream and non-dairy milk. And while I used peanut butter powder, the real stuff could be subbed in if you don’t have the powder on hand. Just put your spin on it to make it your own.

0,Veggie Pasta with Tomato Sauce | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"3-Color Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce  I love pasta, but I don’t love the carb heaviness it can leave me with afterwards. In fact, just this week I ate one small pancake at Bob’s Red Mill and on the way home I felt tired enough for a nap after only being up for about 3 hours. So my simple solution to off-setting the carbs is to sub in vegetables for two-thirds of the noodles. This not only makes the dish lighter in general, but also provides another two to three servings of vegetables which pretty much benefits everyone whether they like it or not (i.e. husbands).   I’ve used carrots for 100 percent of the noodles in a pasta dish before but it ultimately left me feeling unsatisfied. So by mixing carrots and zucchini ribbons in with whole wheat spaghetti noodles, I was able to satisfy my raging pasta cravings with less than half the calories. Not to mention, it’s quite a beautiful dish.  Ribboning vegetables is simple: Just rinse the veggies and peel away any rough parts of the skin with a vegetable peeler, and then continue to ribbon out the vegetable until it’s practically gone. And if you’re looking for an easy way to spice up your go-to marinara, simply add in some sun dried tomato sauce or spread to give it a sophisticated twist without much effort.

0,Blueberry Maple Protein Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Blueberry Maple Protein Shake  For a while now I’ve been seeing the blueberry maple flavor combination pop up, and every time I do I start to salivate immediately. Cakes, syrups, pancakes – it makes sense. The two just seem to be meant together much like peanut butter and basil (trust me, I know what I’m doing.)    But being the simplicity-obsessed person than I am, I knew I wanted to make a blueberry-maple recipe that was a bit less involved. Call it lazy, I call it uncomplicated. And since I have a protein shake most mornings on my walk to work, I thought it the perfect opportunity to put a creative spin on one of my favorite breakfasts.  Blueberry and maple are a perfect summer flavor combination, and when thrown into an ice-creamy health drink, the pairing tastes all the better. You can make this recipe vegan-friendly by opting for a non-dairy milk or yogurt base and protein powder. You can also throw in a big handful of spinach without it affecting the taste at all, which makes it even more of a well-balanced meal.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/blueberry-maple-protein-shake/
0,Basil and Peanut Butter Sandwich | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Peanut Butter and Basil Sandwich  The other week, I made spring rolls for dinner. Nothing fancy – just rice paper rolled around rice noodles, carrot and cucumber sticks, and some peanut sauce for dipping. Oh, and basil. This was key.   If there’s one thing you should know about my husband and me, it’s that we have different tastes. I, for instance, can pick up a handful of basil and eat it raw – joyfully. My husband, on the other hand, gets skeptical if there’s any more than 2 sprigs in one dish. Men and women, so different sometimes.  And so, while eating his spring rolls stuffed plentifully with fresh basil, he began to pick all of the leaves out and set them on his plate. And in a moment of fury and confusion, I asked, “Are you gonna eat that?” To which he replied, “No, it’s just too much.” And so I did what any logical foodie would do. I swiped them up in one hand, dipped them in my peanut sauce, and devoured them in one intense and purely satisfying bite. And in that moment, I knew peanut butter and basil would do great things together.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/peanut-butter-and-basil-sandwich/
0,Walnut and Honey Spiced Protein Shake | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Honey and Walnut Spiced Protein Shake  First off, let me tell you, if you haven’t had a protein shake that tastes like a straight-up milkshake, then you haven’t lived. And this recipe may just be your gateway drug into the land of pumped-up protein shake bliss.   A couple of years ago, while my husband and I were living in Portland, OR, our friends had us over for dinner and topped off the meal with walnut, honey, cardamom, and coriander milkshakes. And while I was skeptical at first, the flavor combination was so rich and adventurous I haven’t been able to shake it from my mind since.  I intended to make this into an actual ice cream shake but didn’t have the heart. One, because it’s just not the healthiest recipe I could share. And two, I don’t have ice cream around the house nearly as often as I intend to as I lack what some people call self control. Envision me, a sad minimalist baker hovering over a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s taking man-sized bites straight from the container, moaning “Ohsogood,” at every taste. May sound gratifying, but it’s really just sad.  So instead? I present you with a Walnut and Honey Spiced Protein Shake, because protein shakes are healthier for you than ice cream and give you a perfectly good excuse to have a ‘milkshake’ for breakfast. If this idea doesn’t titillate your lady tastes, I don’t know what will.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/honey-and-walnut-spiced-protein-shake/
0,Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Pancakes | Minimalist Baker Recipes,"Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes  Hello, world. That’s what WordPress recommends I say here for my first post. Personally, I disagree. I’d rather go with something more friendly like, “Hey, thanks for stopping by.” Because what says “hello” and “thanks for stopping by my blog” more clearly than that? But really, thanks for stopping by. And welcome to Minimalist Baker.   This site has been my brainchild for just a little while now, but it’s really been in the making for long time because I’ve always loved minimalist baking. I just never called it that. One day a few months ago, I started to envision a place where I could share only my favorite recipes that gushed simple. This is because I find something very intriguing about recipes that require very few ingredients, very little time, and only minimal equipment, which is why all of the recipes I plan to post on this site will fall into at least one of these three categories. All the while, keeping health and taste a top priority. In short, this site embodies everything I adore about food – its simplicity, its beauty, its delicious taste, and its joy-giving nature.  If there’s one thing you should know about me right up front, it’s that I love pancakes, always have. My mom used to coax me out of bed with them in the mornings. Otherwise, I swear I’d still be sleeping through sixth grade. And since then, I’ve put my own spin on my pancakes, making them as simple, healthy, and flavorful as possible. This recipe is no exception to that.  I’ve called these chocolate chip oatmeal cookie pancakes for a very plain reason: That’s exactly what they taste like. Only they contain no butter and no added sugar besides chocolate chips, and they can be made both gluten-free and vegan. They also contain almond butter for a healthy punch of protein for staying power throughout the morning.  ",https://minimalistbaker.com/chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookie-pancakes/
