       "'Fluffy Vegan Scrambled Eggs\\n\\n\\nIf you’ve ever wanted to make a vegan version of scrambled eggs but craved something a little more special than tofu, this is the recipe for you.\\nPerhaps you’re looking for a more “eggy” texture and flavor than tofu, want to cut back on eggs, are sensitive to soy/tofu, or just want to change up your breakfast routine.\\nIn any case, let me show you how easy it is to make these fluffy, vegan scrambled eggs!\\n\\nThis recipe is inspired by the Just Egg product everyone’s been talking about. I was so excited to see an egg product that looked (and supposedly tasted) like the real thing! The only thing I didn’t love was the addition of canola oil, which some health experts believe to be highly processed and inflammatory in the body.\\nSo, I wanted to take a swing at my own version and am pretty excited about the results.\\n\\n\\nThe base of this 9-ingredient recipe is soaked split mung beans, a.k.a. moong dal.\\nIt’s a soft legume that’s easy to digest and happens to be the color of scrambled eggs (for the win).\\nOnce soaked, it’s blended with light coconut milk for added fat (which I discovered helped things like my Buckwheat Crepes bind well without sticking to the pan).\\nFor color and flavor I added turmeric, nutritional yeast, onion powder, and black salt, a.k.a. kala namak. It’s a special seasoning that has a magical eggy flavor. It’s crazy how much it really does taste like eggs! If you don’t have black salt either order it or just use whatever salt you have on hand. It’s not absolutely essential.\\nRice flour helps thicken and give body and texture to the “eggs.” And oil adds a little bit more fat for pliability.\\nOnce blended it’s time to cook!\\n\\nI found the best method for cooking these “eggs” is in a non-stick pan (we like this one as a healthier alternative to Teflon). But you can use a well-oiled cast iron in a pinch.\\nHeat over medium-low, add just enough of the mixture to coat the pan, then cover and cook for a couple minutes.\\nThe edges should appear dry, which means it’s time to push them around with a soft spatula. Cover and cook for 1-2 minutes more for a soft scramble or up to 4-5 minutes (flipping occasionally) for a firm scramble.\\n\\nWe hope you LOVE these vegan scrambled eggs! They’re:\\nFluffy\\nEggy\\nSatisfying\\nEasy to make\\nVersatile\\n&amp; Incredibly delicious\\nThese would make the perfect thing to have on hand for easy scrambles throughout the week. Or, use as a base for things like quiche, frittatas, omelets, and more! Oh the eggy possibilities.\\nIf you’re into breakfast scrambles, also be sure to check out our Southwest Tofu Scramble, Masala-Spiced Tofu Scramble, Sweet Potato Kale Hash, and Fluffy Chickpea Scramble.\\nIf you try this recipe, let us know! Leave a comment, rate it, and don’t forget to tag a photo #minimalistbaker on Instagram. Cheers, friends!\\n\\n'"
